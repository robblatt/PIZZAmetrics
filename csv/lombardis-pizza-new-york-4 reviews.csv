0,Heather C.,1,4,"Everything you have ever read or heard about New York pizza is embodied in Lombardi's.  Not only is it touted as the oldest pizzeria in the US but you walk in an immediately feel authentically as if you've finally visited New York when you step inside.  The pizza is amazing!   The breadsticks-Do not  waste your money - unless you want plain bread. They don't have any garlic flavor.  Even our server suggested against it, but we tried them anyway.  We shared a pizza and ate the entire thing.Note: they only accept cash They have an ATM insideNo free refills.   Other than this- I would add this to a top 20 must visit while in NYC list.",7/18/2019,107,71,70,INkugCoxdYBHWrGZ4HBrZQ
1,Anuksha S.,0,3,"Big tourist spot - i liked the ricotta on the white pizza and overall good margherita. The crust is more well done  and crispy than a lot of other places in the city. Lombardi's is pricey, the man seating us was extremely rude, and the service was subpar. Will not be back. There is better pizza in new york and way better service.",7/18/2019,299,22,46,Xu51GJPtJSY3c46LBLYn0A
2,Gabe G.,0,4,"Came here because of the name, really that's all they have going for them. Service was excellent, can't really complain. My only problem was the food. We always hear Lombardi's this Lombardi's that.. but I've had way better pizza. Don't get me wrong it's not bad food, but it really did not live to the hype. Also it's cash only which isn't the best. It's a very casual fast place, you can definitely grab a quick bite to eat.Final grades:Service-AFood- B-",7/9/2019,234,17,36,qwjaep-Xg7N1IaPWszbeeQ
3,Leo M.,0,5,"Cash only! Great pizza place with a part of history!  Everybody is very attentive and respectful! Despite the price the pizza is worth it! Will come here again every Time I'm in New York! This is the meaning of, you get what you pay for! QUALITY and taste!",7/21/2019,3,8,56,6KoR2stINbjtUirJWG7l5g
4,Addy G.,1,5,"For a long time I've always wanted to experience an authentic, New York pizza. My taste buds were yearning for it, and every time I go to the city I never choose wisely. I'll get some $.99 slice of pizza that is mostly grease. I hear that most of the great pizza places are in Brooklyn which I rarely ever stay in. I was so excited when my colleague, who lived in New York for over a decade recommended we go over to Lombardi's's in Soho. We were staying in Tribeca so we were able to walk right over. We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to be seated right away. We met her friend there so the three of us ordered one round of Aperol/Campari spritz' followed by a round of martinis. Paul was our server and he was absolutely wonderful. Great service. We ordered a Caesar salad and a house salad first, then a ricotta/pesto small pizza and a large margherita pizza. That seemed to be a little bit more than we needed. We probably could've gotten two small pizzas. The salads were yummy and our pizzas were delicious. Always a fan of margherita pizzas, I was surprised at how much I actually loved the ricotta and pesto pie. It was absolutely delicious. If I return to Lombardi's, which I hope I do, I am definitely going to get that one. Everything was absolutely mouthwatering. The place was busy, and has a very cool authentic/Italian vibe with the checkered tablecloth, the fresh scent of pizza swirling through the entire restaurant, and an amazing location in downtown Soho amongst all of the fun boutiques and shops. The prices are extremely reasonable, but bring your cash! This place is cash only. There is an ATM that charges $3.75, in case you're in a pinch. When you go to the back of the restaurant The kitchen is open so you can see the pizza is being made, hot and sweaty as you would imagine a pizza kitchen in the middle of a hot summer day to be. Overall, this experience was great. My colleague, being a former New Yorker definitely knew the right direction to steer me to for my first ever, real New York pizza experience. I have not, one bad thing to say about this place. That is why it has totally earned a rare, yet well-deserved, five star rating!",7/22/2019,1175,729,3764,hA2X9akTxboda17YqbF20g
5,Johanna B.,1,3,"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore. Well maybe Dean Martin loved Lombardi's but I was disappointed with my first time experience.As a native New Yorker, I've always heard people brag about it. I had kept it on my bucket list since I love pizza and wanted to experience it for myself. Well, tonight I had the opportunity to do so.The pizzeria sits on the corner of Spring Street and once you step inside, it is quaint and nostalgic with red and white checker plastic tablecloths and a rustic atmosphere. Space was wrapped around into two rooms with a good number of tables. We just walked right in and were seated immediately.Service was good. Appetizers were available but since we were eager to try the pizza, we jumped straight to it. In total, there might have been six varieties of pizza,  but we selected the classic margarita.Red wine accompanied our meal and it was pretty good.The pizza was large (we were told enough for 2) with 8 slices in total. There was also the option of a personal size. Minutes later, pizza arrived. Looked good and smelled fragrant but overall it fell short of my expectations.For one thing, it was super thin and crunchy (meaning not much bend to the pizza at all). The sauce and cheese were both a very thin (kind of dry) layer. No olive oil taste or evidence of it in sight.In addition, the pizza wasn't piping hot when served as I like it.  By the time I got to the 2nd or 3rd slice, it was room temperature (and harder to bite into).Finally, it might have been a large pizza but it was so thin with the topping of cheese and sauce being skimpy that I still felt hungry after eating the 4 slices.Overall, I consider my dining experience as ""been there, done that"". A let down.BTW, cash only.",5/23/2019,507,595,1759,ErEf2Xr-1qF1JAB-u9lwjg
6,Trixie N.,1,5,"Since 1905 Lombardi Pizza has been serving coal oven thin crust pizza. They are also known as the founders of what is known today as New York style American Pizza. I love older established restaurants and this is one I definitely love! I came here to meet with a friend and we had the Old School Margarita Pizza. It was a simple pizza but the taste was so spot-on what Old School pizza should taste like. The crust was thin, a bit crunchy and a bit chewy. The simple toppings of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese were fresh and perfect! I have always loved thin crust pizza only because I do not care for the crust. This was the perfect pizza for me! This is definitely place I would love to return to and try out their different toppings. So delicious!!",5/14/2019,1112,737,6315,quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw
7,Najwa G.,1,4,"Really good pizza but didn't exactly blow me out of the water. As Lombardi's claim to fame is that it is the first pizzeria in the U.S., expect it to be busy any time of the day. My friend and I went here on a Wednesday night and waited around 15-20 minutes so nothing crazy but I would expect a much longer wait during peak times. We stuck with one of their signature dishes- the clam pie.  Pros- a more than adequate number of clams, a solid crust, and enough to share among two people (not sure about three people, or maybe I just eat too much). Cons- a solid crispy crust shouldn't necessarily mean that the pizza itself should be ridiculously crispy as well. No, it was not as hard as a rock, but it definitely could have been better than what it was. Rather than that, I don't have any complaints. Definitely squeeze the lemon they give you over the pizza. Or, rather, squeeze it over each individual slice before you eat it so it doesn't get soggy quickly. Enjoy!",7/17/2019,96,182,386,o9hU7o_3Kndp882PpLDcSg
8,Dan J.,1,5,"A truly spectacular example of a true thin crust NYC pizza. Famed to be the first coal oven pizza restaurant in NYC in the 1900s, their pizza making expertise has not depreciated over the ages and the dining experience was equally as pleasant. On a sunny weekday afternoon, our party of 4 was seated almost immediately (they have a small first floor dining area as well as more basement seating), offered drinks and the menu by the efficient and friendly waitress. We decided to stick with the old school classic and ordered a large pie of Margherita and cheese pizza to share among the 4 of us, which turned out to be the perfect portion for lunch! For a freshly made pizza, it came within a very reasonable amount of time, around 10 minutes, and it passed the flip test with flying colors (if you hold a fresh pizza slice, it keeps its straight and crisp shape). Each bite into the crunchy hot slice was the perfect mixture of fresh Margherita sauce, specks of basil flavor and creamy rounds of Mozzarella cheese all on top of a crispy crust that was thin but also chewy. Usually the crust at the end of a slice does not enthuse me but I gobbled up every piece of chewy and salted crust with fervor!Hands down the best pizza pie I've ever had in NYC and it would have been such a shame if I were to leave New York without dining at this landmark restaurant. Highly recommend for any food lover out there that want a taste of new york history or simply a delicious and affordable pie!",5/11/2019,216,54,77,fmoZ3wNzVXhVMVT8ZXAUxg
9,Michelle P.,1,3,"Lombardi's is a bit overrated. With that said, set your expectations right and it will be enjoyable.Having seen lines out the door in the past, we immediately got a table on a rainy Friday night.Interested in beer at first, those dreams were squashed by a list of domestics. A bottle of Chianti for $36 did the trick.The Cake Boss pizza looked the most inspiring on the menu. Unfortunately, you can't have prosciutto and eggplant, so we went with prosciutto. There's also only one size, so we went with the large.The pizza may have had a little touch much arugula, and lost the effect when cut. When picked up, the meat, cheese, veggies and sauce coagulated perfectly and gave the most desirable result. The crust game was on point. I felt we may have overspent for a pizza and bottle of wine, but it was nice to have the table service and the cute, pizzeria atmosphere. It wasn't a life changing pizza experience, but I did enjoy myself.",4/27/2019,506,1307,8020,OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g
10,Jingru H.,0,5,"Wonderful place to have a nice piece of Pizza! But due to its fame, you will probably have to wait if you don't have reservations. The service here are great. They explained different flavors to us and made just the best recommendations!Tips: Better taste it before it goes cold.",7/23/2019,0,1,2,xURcVZmbgJDny1dVG6GN0g
11,Sophia L.,1,5,"When people rave about NYC pizza, this is exactly what they are talking about!!After a slight detour to the bank because we didn't realize they cash only, my friend and I ordered a large original pizza to share. Was just a little bit too big to finish in one setting, but the regular size would have been too small. The crust was crispy yet chewy, the sauce tasted fresh, and there was the perfect proportion of cheese. My one very minor complaint was that the pizza was a bit under seasoned, but they generously provide shakers of s&p, red pepper, and cheese at the table.",7/3/2019,1,38,62,ZIqfha_9skWRwmX9EOWeIw
12,Matthew R.,1,5,"My one regret was that I had but one pizza I was able to eat. I was dying to try the famous clam pie, but alas, I was by myself and it doesn't come in the smaller size (less than 16 inches). Every bite was a celebration of fresh ingredients and the magic of NYC water. This is what a pizza should be. I can't wait to return on subsequent trips.",6/25/2019,219,625,237,jQB-yh5WoOPMrfqwZEBfSg
13,Risa S.,1,3,"A place where if you're a tourist it's on your ""must eat"" list when you visit nyc and if you're a local it's prob on your ""eat once just to say you've tried it"" list. Came here on a Saturday night to meet up with a friend that was in town. If she didn't choose the location I don't know if I would have ever gone. Cash only. There's an ATM inside. Got there around 6:30pm and the wait for a table for 5 was 30-40minutes. We probably got seated in about 20-25 minutes. Not too bad for a place that was packed and a lot of people waiting. We got the clam pizza (large-8 slices) and the margherita (small-6 slices). I think it was definitely enough for the 5 of us (but we were also saving room for dessert and I had a beer). Both pies came out super quick. The clam pizza was delicious! Super strong garlic smell but the taste itself wasn't overpowering with it. Which is good. And the added fresh lemon juice squeeze makes the pie that much better. The margherita pizza was also good as well. Pretty standard. But I prefer the clam better. I personally like the crust. So thin and crispy! Mmm. Major downside. The price. For one large, one small and a beer, the total (with tip) came out to be around $75. The pizza itself is delicious but I think there are a lot of other places in NY where you can get delicious pizza for a lot less of a value. But you're paying for the name, I guess. Service was good for a busy place. Our server made sure our waters were always full and that we were doing fine. Will I come here again? Only if an out-of-towner wants to go.",4/28/2019,4,212,420,ZCyka_VOgWMN2eV-AE5jhg
14,Jessica E.,1,4,Wow such an honor to eat at the first pizza place in America!! You can feel the old school pizza join vibe - it's definitely a real treat!I got the large Margherita pie to split with one other person and it was perfect. The bread was FANTASTIC. Cannot emphasize that enough however the sauce was pretty bland. I recommend that they add some spicing or something to it.So not the best pizza I've ever had but definitely worth visiting!!,4/20/2019,286,107,248,b4IR7Qs8PCk0VRU4UK88RQ
15,Wanda H.,1,4,"We stopped in here after going on the St. Patrick's Cathedral Catacomb tour (GO. DO. THIS!), so we could say we ate in Little Italy.  And we did.  We ordered the Bruschetta appetizer, a House Salad, and a small White Pizza, to share amongst 3 of us.  While waiting for our food, the Sangria and cider (Magner's!) were both very good.  The waitress was worried that we might be disappointed in the amount of food, for 3 of us.  But once we let her know we weren't there to really fill up, she was good to go.  We enjoyed every bit of that food, and didn't leave stuffed, but with VERY happy moufs!",6/10/2019,104,352,304,hKBQ-PFlcB-t5FK3HUxoyQ
16,Tina H.,1,5,We couldn't have been any luckier with our timing! It seems as if we beat the dinner rush! We definitely wanted to try Lombardi's before we left New York City and I'm so thankful we did because it was so delicious. The service was fantastic. They are well known for their Margherita pizza. The sauce is EVERYTHING. You can even purchase their sauce! We love pizza and beer. So we also paired our pizza with a nice cold glass of Peroni. DELICIOUS. I really enjoy the flatbread type crust and can still be able to put away more pizza!The ambiance is very nice and casual. There were larger groups with families. I also noticed locals still enjoy a touristy establishment! They also sell shirts and souvenirs here too. I would definitely love to come back to Lombardi's and try some of their other great pizzas.,6/25/2019,86,157,231,zTJtUsTon0muUcMe1YMsEg
17,Nadine A.,0,5,We came here after lunch hour. It was pretty quiet which we really like. Their pizza was pretty good! Thin crust and tasty! Will definitely come back :),7/23/2019,12,29,9,B_PVLoQ-DmvanCpPrUwQ_w
18,Rick N.,0,4,"So I had to try the world famous Lombardi's. AMAZING. Tastes like the pizza I grew up with in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Congress Pizza). The sauce is smooth and a little sweet. This is how every pizza should be made. Tried an Italian Raspberry soda, which was good, but had too much creme. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the waitstaff was a little too quick with everything.",7/19/2019,1,25,14,LycJJZn0wot6Q_RMDkWfog
19,Grace L.,0,4,Lombardi's is the home of pizza and everyone who loves pizza should certainly make a stop by this traditional pizzeria.Lombardi's makes traditional pies at a reasonable price and was the first pizzeria in America. I've been here a few times with my pizza loving friends and have always had great service and good food.They make their pizzas traditionally- with San Marzano tomatoes and few toppings- but every bite is delicious. It feels like this is what REAL pizza is supposed to taste like.The only negative is they are cash only. They have an ATM on site but it is rather annoying to have to go catch cash before a meal.,6/15/2019,179,28,27,3MkHkJSoxouwiyMSRAH2JA
20,Chaz D.,1,2,"When I came to New York for the first time last week, I was set on being able to try Lombardi's Pizza. After all that I had read on the history of this restaurant, I knew I had to get some pizza. I came in with a group of three and one of the people had a dairy allergy. I know that obviously that's a difficult allergy to have in a pizza restaurant, but I figured that there would be at least a couple different items they could order regardless. I was wrong. FOOD: Aside from a few salads and some small appetizers, there was nothing else on the menu besides the pizza. Don't get me wrong, I'm game for some pizza, but we needed something for our person with an allergy.SERVICE: I then asked our server if there was any possible way that we could order one of the full pizzas, and just not put cheese on half of it. He went back and forth with me on trying to say that the pizzas are the way that they are and ultimately it was frustrating. I tried and tried to explain it, and for some odd reason he just didn't understand. This was the last conversation that we had before I ended up asking for the check for our drinks so that we could leave and go somewhere else. I also was disappointed to see that 90% of the people working at this restaurant weren't even Italian. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but for relying on authenticity, it sure doesn't sit right with me. OVERALL: I spent about 25 minutes inside Lombardi's before we left unsatisfied and disappointed. I was extremely excited to try this restaurant, but I will not be returning.",3/31/2019,114,67,171,fjnVxFIP3d8gcYuiII83kQ
21,Sarah B.,0,4,Good pizza! A little light on the meat toppings but overall very good. The Italian soda was really good and something different. Great atmosphere and so fun walking through the kitchen to get to the upstairs dining. Staff was friendly and service quick. Recommend.,7/14/2019,2,32,30,DACzNIIzaRiwOqGqPVquyw
22,J T.,0,4,"I'm usually not a fan of pizza at all, but I had to make an exception when I heard Lombardi's is America's first pizzeria. We ordered the white pizza (full of cheesy goodness) and the clam pie where we were given a generous amount (3 dozens worth) of chopped clam. Both pizzas were super thin and crispy, exactly how I envision the perfect pizza to taste like because thick, chewy pizzas are the worst. :) This was legitimately one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.The restaurant has a dining area in the front and back as well as a dining area in the basement. I was not a fan of the dining area in the basement since it was in too close proximity to the washrooms and my table was pretty much directly in front of the washroom. I understand not much can be done since this pizzeria is so popular and the extra seating in the basement is to alleviate long wait times. We did not have to wait more than 15 minutes for a table even though it was prime lunch hour. Hopefully I can be seated in the main dining area on my next visit.  Prices are a little overpriced for pizza and the restaurant can be a little touristy. But I still love the quality of the pizzas here.",6/5/2019,2,60,96,2SHMIVAtesGrlJu5EmMTpQ

25,Julie C.,1,2,"Came on a Friday night around 7pm for dinner and was seated quickly. The restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside but majority of the place was empty. This should have been a red flag since I would expect an establishment with over 5k reviews to have some kind of wait.We ordered the clam pie and half a white/margarita pie. The food looked appealing but tasted incredibly DRY. The margarita pie wasn't saucy enough and the clam pie tasted so dry that with each bite I needed to squeeze some lemon over it. At one point I just picked off all the clams and left the crust. The food was overpriced for the quality of the pizzas. Big disappointment considering all the glowing reviews for this place.Bottom line, super overrated. There are better places in NYC for pizza.",2/17/2019,64,158,508,RoO8V10M8wLrJT-JnuNVig

Bad customer service.  Rude people, the whole lot.  Would avoid. Three of us went to try it out, ate one slice each... didn't want to be rude... packed the rest to not be rude.  Threw it in the trash as we exited cause the homeless guy outside didn't want it either.  Wow!!",5/10/2019,14,25,23,75m78thmBkgcnsLS0zOTTw
29,Jeff B.,1,5,"Lombardi's is one of the pizza places I've wanted to try for several trips. Finally this one I found myself in SoHo and made it. It was worth the wait. Got there around 1 PM so still lunch hour. Was seated right away. The place is bigger than it looks from the street. We shared a mozzarella tomato appetizer which was really good drizzled with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil that's at each table. We ordered the Buddy Special pizza with sides of Kalamata olives, pepperoni and meatballs. It was done perfectly and those add ins really put it over the top. Perfect coal fired pizza. We got the small which was plenty for our group of three. The service was great and the place was clean and well organized. The bathrooms are unisex and super clean.

32,Dana K.,1,4,"The difference between pizza and your opinion is I asked for pizza. My friend wanted pizza and I promised to bring her to all types of pizza places in NYC. I know I'm a good friend. Everyone knows New York City is known for their pizza and this place is supposed to be famous for their pizza. Ironically I'm not a huge pizza fan but I do enjoy pizza without marinara sauce, white pizza. White pizza is easy to find in NY so I was eating too! When we got there this place had a huge line and wait. Who had time for that? I'm sure some people but we had a lot of places to see so...not us. We asked if we could get an order to go and they said yes. They had a whole other room that was designated for to go orders. Thank god we were going to be able to get a pizza! I ordered our pizza and it only took a minute. We got half margarita half and white pizza. He told us it would be ready in 10 mins. I went across the street to the Rice Pudding to pass the time. I knew dessert would go great with pizza, but who am I kidding dessert goes well with anything. We ended up eating the pizza outside the restaurant on the street...like animals. Honestly, I didn't care, we shoveled those pieces of pies in like we hadn't eaten in days. We were hungry and the pizza was hot. It beat waiting in that long line. The pizza was good but not the best I've ever had. I would go back but you would never catch me in that line. I suggest ordering to go and eating like an animal like we did outside.",1/12/2019,419,663,17246,59GSwMflQFllOAWvw0F5mw

The server was very helpful and suggested we order half a pie of two different toppings. We got white pizza and pepperoni!!! Ahh I love how the pepperoni cooks up and becomes into little tiny cups. The edge of pepperoni is crispy while maintaining and tender middle. Pizza is packed with flavor and also crispy bottom dough.

The lighting is good and the tables and utensils are clean. The menu has a medium variety of things, including pizza and salads and bread sticks. You can choose between large or small pizza. I got a small Margarita and a large clam pie. NOTE FOR CLAM/SEAFOOD LOVERS: GET THE CLAM PIE BECAUSE THE PIZZA HAVE LIKE A MILLION CLAMS ON IT, FRESH PEELED TOO! It's soooo good. Me and my family ate it all! The only thing BAD about this place is that the pizza is too overpriced. It costed me 60 something dollars just for 2 pizzas. But that's ok.

37,Greshka P.,1,3,"As NYC's first Pizzeria you must visit it at least once.  We arrived at around 7pm, on Christmas eve.  Place was busy but wait was only 15 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered a glass of wine.  This took a bit and by when our glasses were in front of us, our buzzer indicated our table was ready.We walked past all the front tables, then through the kitchen, then up the stairs, and were seated on the top room.  This part was really cool, you could see the history and imagine how long this place has been standing here.  That top room was small, brick walls, and the view is an alley - Very New York, in my opinion.After looking at the menu we decided on sharing a small pizza, and a calzone was also ordered.  The small pizza has 6 slices, perfect for sharing.  Think crust, good amount of toppings but flavor wise I've definitely had better.  It wasn't bad but I was not impressed.  The calzone, they brought it last, and when my friend cut it she realized they had put the wrong ingredients.  Sent it back and they made a fresh one for her.  This is a big portion too so after eating half she requested a box to go.  The server said he could box it for her but that never came.  While eating we had also asked for a second glass of wine, this took a long time too, and I noticed the table next to us complaining about not getting theirs either.  We also had to chase down our waiter to pay.  And after noticing my friend's ""to go box"" wasn't coming at all we decided to leave.Experience wasn't great but the calzone was good, pizza was OK and it's a cool place to see.   So, 3 stars is what I'll give it.",1/9/2019,1408,984,4722,mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB-MmS9g
38,Radhika G.,1,1,"I was really excited to try Lombardis, because it *is* the original pizza in NYC. However, I can think of at least 10 places that I would go in NYC to get a better slice than this.We walked in late on a Friday evening and we were seated pretty immediately. This place is cash only, but they have an ATM, just to be aware.We ordered a Margherita pizza ($25) and an order of breadsticks ($10). The breadsticks was extremely dough-y and the pizza had extremely flavorless crust and was very floppy / cardboard-y. The sauce was bitter, as well. They also gave us paper plates, which could be fine in theory, but is odd given that it was a sit down restaurant. Overall, would absolutely not recommend coming here for a ""NYC-slice"" or any pizza. Places you could go to instead: Juliana's, Prince St. Pizza, Adrienne's Pizza Bar, or honestly 99 cent pizzas",1/11/2019,334,76,101,GtmvDH3LqZf3-NlHUYXgrQ
39,Ari L.,1,4,"It was actually better than I had expected given the fact that it's a touristy restaurant. We waited less than 10 minutes to get seated. We ordered two pizzas, one margherita and a mushroom/pepperoni pizza. The two pizzas were more than enough for all five of us. I don't understand the concept of a cash only restaurant especially in 2019 other than for shielding earnings from taxes. Also, the ac unit above the door needs to be replaced. We sat right by the door and every time the door opened the ac unit went off and it sounded like an old and broken Vegas slot machine.",6/30/2019,5,32,10,f_tnXODTwuMhK17g5akffg

41,Daym P.,0,4,"My suggestion is to arrive early. People LOVE a great pizza and that is exactly what you'll receive at America's First Pizzeria. I decided to live my best life and order their Original Margarita but added meatball to mine and let me tell you, that was the best decision that I could had made. The first bite had me sold. Their fresh mozz is what drives us crazy and when I say us, it was easy to see around the room that happiness was the going feeling for everyone looked to be enjoying their pizza as well. You get the fresh mozz pull and the sauce was definitely homegrown! I had plenty of meatball action on my slice, enough to make an ACTION MOVIE drool over this one and say, ""Well DAYUM, that pizza slice has it going on and everything to keep the people wrapped up and LOCKED IN!"" The meatball had a tender bite to it and was well seasoned. Now me personally, I definitely enjoy a more crispier bite on the crust but I refuse to sit here and beat you all in the head over some crust for when the pizza is THIS GOOD, you just PUT SOME RESPECT ON IT!!",6/13/2019,1068,24,3,J4A9IGoxZJAwdyW0aoGbCQ

We ordered half Margherita half Ricotta cheese, first of the will charge you price for the more expensive half of the pizza , which in our case was ricotta, I always knew it was half and half.. ok. Good- ricotta side I enjoyed, lots of cheese, tasty, good crust on a whole pie, thin , crispy, nice flavor. Margherita, this is where the disappointments comes from - sauce is sour , not the quality I was expecting , I am not even comparing it to anywhere in Italy , just the USA. Sour sauce, barely any cheese and basil. The ambience was a fail as well, especially sitting in a back room.",7/6/2019,5,30,19,xstST_4UyG-bMKaDqIH74Q

I immediately stopped eating it and we brought it to the waitresses attention...She was understanding and immediately reached out to the manager on duty. He tried to question how it happened and where the hair was which really bothered me...I mean there's a hair in my food period. I didn't plant it/ wth.

46,Christina A.,1,3,"My sister and I came across this place via Yelp and and a google search. We wanted to try some New York Pizza and Lombardi's popped up on the list. We figured it'd be good to try since it was well known in the city. I wasn't sure what to expect but I knew I had to try their Margherita pizza, it was what they were known for!We popped in for lunch and it was packed. We thought we would be waiting awhile but to our surprise we were taken in within 15 minutes. Service was attentive and the waitress was friendly and patient. The walls were covered in photos of the owner posing with famous celebrities so we knew we had come to a staple pizzeria in NYC.We came for pizza so that's exactly what we ordered. A medium Margherita pizza to share and being meatatarians, my sister and I decided to share the homemade meatballs. First off, the meatballs were good in their own right but what made the dish was the tomato sauce. There was nothing left on the plate when we were done. Second, the pizza was good, not the best margherita I've had but pretty good. Thin crust, a good amount of that delicious tomato sauce and a decent amount of the fresh mozerella. Not a bad pizza by all means.Overall, I'd say this place was warm and friendly, and the food was pretty tasty. The cost was a little on the higher side for what you get but we left full and satisfied nonetheless.",1/17/2019,110,48,99,i27n2r8kscamsvd0FSn4Fw

We were sat upstairs - through the main dining area and kitchen and then up the stairs. The water is served in plastic cups for some reason. We ordered the white pizza and added garlic spinach. This pizza is delicious! Took about 15 mins or so to come out. We also enjoyed Pinot grigio wine with our lunch. What's not to love?,4/7/2019,163,31,543,S_-R3oSGL7znvNa3q4utfA
48,Shannon B.,0,3,"Popped in because we had a 10% off coupon.  Very touristy.  Claims to be America's first pizzeria which is why it gets a lot of attention.   To be noted... You can't buy single slices here and i think most importantly,  THEY ONLY TAKE CASH, which no one told us. We discovered this after sitting and reading it in the menu.  That's kind of a big deal and no one even said anything.  Anyway,  we ordered a small margarita pizza. Part of the crust was burnt, which i guess is what you get with a coal oven, and toppings were rather skimpy.  Pizza was good but nothing to write home about. Maybe something with more flavorful toppings might be better.  Before we even finished the pizza,  a staff member rushed out and asked us to take the remaining slice off so he could use the pan for additional pizza.  Kind of a turn off but shows how busy they are.",7/19/2019,91,19,46,HJucAgqIRpXyRxnjxriNUA

We ordered the clam pizza and we were not disappointed! The pizza was covered with clams, which we were not expecting. We figured there would be a couple of clams and that would be it. That was not the case. The taste is a much simpler taste. If you're looking for a pizza with bold flavors; this may not be it for you. We had an amazing server! I did not catch his name, but he was cheery, personable, funny, and a FABULOUS singer. The whole time he was singing old Sinatra songs, humming, or even showtunes.

In Chicago we went to Lou Malanti's pizzeria to try the famously known deep dish pizza (first time ever trying deep dish pizza). In NY we decided to hit up Lombardi's Pizza, a well known NY pizzeria which was not too far from our hotel. Lombardi's reminded me a lot of the pizza they serve in Italy. Thin crust and pizza, not too many toppings but still delicious. We ordered a half and half pizza for 3 people and I really enjoyed the pizza here. It was pretty crowded and we were still seated pretty quickly, even better our pizza also came out quickly! Overall my experience here at Lombardi's Pizza was great!

69,Dana A.,1,3,"Based on extensive reviews i was really looking forward to having the best pizza in nyc. We visited this location around 6:30pm on a friday. This is a large spot, we didnt run into any issues being sat immediately. Please keep in mind that this is a cash only establishment!We ordered the Buddys special. The pizza took a little time to come out, but each one is made fresh so i didnt mind the wait. The pizza itself was good but not the best. The pizza dough itself was well cooked throughout and had a good crisp to it. The arugula and prosciutto complimented their sauce well. For some specialty pies, youre only able to order it as a large. I was only able to fit 3 slices, but my bf took the cake and ate the rest! Honestly, i still love grimaldis over this, but im still on my pizza journey. With grimaldis i can easily eat a whole pie. Our pie at Lombardis although good, was a little harder to eat since it it so well done it made it a little harder to chew and took more time lol. I knocked off stars because the prices holy crap!! Our pie was $35! Absolutely insane. Also the fact that you cant choose your pie size.

71,Jaesung J.,1,2,"Overall - again, lesson learned: do not go to restaurants that highlight their history or media/celebrity appearances as their forte. This may have been the first pizzeria in America, but the taste, the value, and the service were so subpar to its contemporary peers, I regret spending $22 dollars + tip for 6 small slices of pizza. They only take cash as well, and this is a huge negative for the modern dining experience. Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone visiting Little Italy or Chinatown - practically any of the nearby restaurants would be a better alternative.Pros - The tomato sauce on the original Margherita Pizza was very tasty and did not taste like it came out of a can. The dough was crusty at the bottom and very thin. However, having been to the oldest pizzeria in America had more value to me as a tourist/culinary enthusiast vs. the actual taste of the food that I paid premium $ for.Cons - taste was mediocre at the price range we paid this for. Portions were pathetic with 6 baby slices of pizza coming out to be $22 dollars. The white pizza (no tomato sauce, just cheese) was beyond bland, and no amount of chili peppers and black pepper could enhance the flavor. On top of that, the server did not get us any ice for our waters (asked twice) and it took him a very long time to get our checks and return the change back to us.",7/4/2018,233,110,408,BAQ0vZoKbr2wtza-am5a8w

That isn't to say that the pizza isn't well made with great ingredients, I just felt like NYC has more to offer in the pizza department. The wait wasn't too long, as their is a lot of seating and only had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Saturday for an early dinner. The history exudes in the decor and the art displayed in the restaurant. Ordered half margarita half white pizza. White pizza was the better of the choice, especially if you're a cheese lover. My girlfriend added pepperoni, but this wasn't necessary. What's the deal with the fact that they don't offer free refills on fountain soda! Am I disappointed that I went to eat here?

An employee named Aaron quickly came to clean the mess. I felt like crap, but he was beyond sweet and didn't seemed bothered at all. After he was done cleaning, he tells the bartender to make us the same drink again. Afterwards, he follows up with us to make sure we're having a good time. I'm speechless.

Price wasn't cheap but I would pay more to go back again. Their service is one of the top, and you can see how they make it in the back too since it's a open area. They use the old style oven and you will not regret to pay extra bucks for it. Parking around that area is almost impossible so I suggest you take cab or just subway. Their liquor is expensive so go to next door bar drink as many as you want first and go back for the best pizza might be the best strategy.

79,Alan A.,1,4,"I love pizza! I have traveled to New Haven to try their brick oven pizzas. I have sought out pizza all over NYC. Some was great some not so great, you can read my other Yelp reviews. I've known about Lombardi's for many years, recently I finally got around to trying their pizza. The location is not someplace I find myself on a regular basis but when I found myself a few blocks away on a Saturday afternoon I decided to go. We arrived about 3PM and were seated right away. We ordered their 12"" Margarita pizza it was the perfect size for two people for lunch. The decor is red checkered table cloth Italian with celebrity photos on the wall and Frank Sinatra on the stereo the perfect atmosphere for eating pizza.The pizza was very good, a nicely charred thin crust topped with a very tasty tomato sauce. The sauce was just right, not too sweet or tart. The cheese is very tasty fresh mozzarella. The crust did not wimp out and each slice did not droop when picked up. The flavor of the crust reminded me of an artisan bread it was loaded with flavor. My only complaint was that they use paper plates and plastic cups for the beverages. But the pizza was excellent. My wife and I talked about going back to try their clam pizza. If we are back in the area again around lunch or dinner time we'll be sure to go back. There is better pizza to be had in NYC but you need to try Lombardi's coal fired pizza at least once. Mangia!",2/7/2019,148,362,2216,nu6b6GpbSMXeQeE-u4sf0A
80,Billy M.,1,4,I think Lombardi's is the best pizza place in Manhattan. You can add so many toppings to your pizza like vegetable meat or herbs. The ambiance has a cozy and modern approach the upstairs is the best place to sit. I recommend ordering their clam pizza it's delicious.,3/31/2019,1238,420,160,5Z5Pq5tMKzbXjATgXsKFFQ
81,Mattison C.,1,5,Went to NYC looking for a great Italian pizza place in Little Italy. Lombardi's was a great place according to yelp. My friend and I tried here and really liked it! We had the signature pizza with eggplant ($36) and a pitcher of Stella beer ($28). Spent $40 each on dinner with everything included tip and tax. It was expensive.,12/11/2018,145,152,291,AUm63LZCY5trnQTYh4DjNg
82,Danny O.,1,3,"Just an ok pizza.  Very thin, crust on the crispy/charred side rather than chewy.  Sauce and cheese are pretty good, proper ratio and intermingling of mozzarella and sauce.  Pepperoni was disappointing, just mediocre little nubs of greasy pepperoni.  Overall flavor is good.But ultimately, this didn't really seem like great pizza.  It was good, it was fine.  Nothing really that special except for the history and the price, which is expensive for what it is.  I'm glad I came, but probably won't be back.  There's better pizza for a better price out there.",12/17/2018,12,143,0,kmsWhIuzA48987Z12-cQ7g
83,Rick B.,0,3,"Cash only! Time to leave the 1800's behind. Meatballs tasted processed and the sauce was bland. The wait staff were slow and kind of took their time returning our change.

84,Sabrina I.,1,5,"I know that this place is a tourist spot but it's one of the oldest and maybe the oldest pizzeria! It's all over everyone's Instagram feed so you can't help but pay this place a visit. Worth the wait? I think YES! I've had many great white pizza options in NY and this place takes #1 for me in every way. It comes out bubbly and cheesy and full of simple dynamic flavors that will have your taste buds wanting more. Some say it fell off and needs many new modern adjustments, I say if it's not broken don't fix it! This place is iconic and full of so much love from all around and I do believe it'll always be my top pick for a pizza joint. It may not be fast food but you'll enjoy the interior ambiance amongst your company and other pizza lovers out there just like you. Staff is ALWAYS friendly and welcoming so it's always a win win in my books. Give it a try- you won't regret!",1/4/2019,27,87,47,mdgJ21WscxAG2eGpgVtL4Q

We stumbled across this the last time we were in town, We were there for 6 days, and ate here three times. Some times of day or week there will be a wait (no reservations). It is worth the wait.

87,Wilbur V.,1,4,"In my lifetime, pizza has always been my favorite food. From being able to eat a whole 18"" pie in one sitting to being motivated to run just so I can eat pizza, I have never tried Lombardi's Pizza despite growing up in the NYC area....until shortly before this review was published.We were fortunate that a friend had to come early to reserve a table of 3 so the wait was nothing when my other friend and I arrived to the restaurant. We were seated promptly and proceeded to order a breadsticks appetizer and the main attraction: the margherita pizza with pepperoni!I wasn't really impressed with the breadsticks, but the pizza was pretty solid. For being the first pizzeria in the states, it did not particularly blow me away one bit. It still was solid! Better than pizza I'd find in Dallas; albeit very pricey ($25 for a 16"" pie). However, this is Manhattan, so you should be expecting almost tourist prices for a place like this.All in all, it's solid, and if this is your first ever pizza experience, it's a great place to break your pizza virginity.",11/25/2018,608,199,167,8LD1moESm7jf42i3Bqcm4A
88,Karen A.,1,4,"My husband wanted to try Lombardi's for quite some time. He finally decided to make it a destination so we trekked to Manhattan. Mind you we have gone as far as New Haven for pizza so this was a cinch. I must say I was impressed. Just because a place has been around for many years does not mean it is very good. Some become tourist traps. This place is not one of those.We opted for the Margarita pizza as we feel to judge a great pizza keep it simple. Since it was lunch we got the smaller size which was a perfect size. I was impressed by the flavorful sauce. It was not too sweet or tangy and was just the proper amount as to not make the pizza soggy. The crust held up nicely. It was crunchy throughout. The mozzarella was nice and stringy. The fresh basil was also a nice touch.Another visit is definitely in our future though I am hesitant to try the clam pizza because on the menu they state beware of sand and shells. I am quite perplexed by this as I feel if you are going to serve something you should have enough pride in your product to do it right. Take Frank Pepe in New Haven as an example, Not a shell nor a piece of sand in sight!",6/23/2018,32,167,401,ivspVrtrYIXKlssD0QH7ZQ
89,Luke L.,0,5,"Pizza's certainly not indigenous to NYC, but New York-style pizza is a very particular item, and the first pizzeria in America was Lombardi's, which opened here in 1905. Several generations of master pizza makers got their starts at Lombardi's, which is still one of the best pizzerias in town, serving thin crust pies with an even thinner layer of sauce, enjoyed on gingham tablecloths.",7/20/2019,0,2,0,G7GpvC6fvSGet3m-faBdUg
90,Alyssa R.,1,4,"This place deserves a 3.5-4 star rating. I heard a lot of hype about their pizzas. I arrived with one other person and we ordered two pizzas. It was way too much food for two, but I really wanted to try different ones. We did a white pizza with pancetta and a margarita. They were both good but would not say great. Definitely worth going if in the area but would not go out of my way. Another gripe is no free refills on drinks. Cash only.",11/18/2018,82,305,195,V-Tv_2hv1Ag3wQrqOpVnEQ
91,RA W.,0,3,"Fun place with lots of animated customers moving in and out!Legend has it, this is the oldest Pizzeria in New York City. NO idea if that's true!The vibe is Little Italy, loud and can be a bit crowded with tourists, so do be in a Little Italy mood if you come here. While this restaurant has decent seating and serves wine, it is by no means a fancy pants establishment...some of the customers were dressed in EXTREMELY casual clothes...you could probably eat here in your pajamas.The sauce on the Margherita pizza tasted sweet to me. The crust is not thin, but it's not super puffy. Ingredients appeared and tasted fresh. This pizza is not dripping in grease. The cheese and sauce is spread out, making it hard to stuff your mouth with all of the pizza ingredients at once. The blue cheese salad dressing was to die for! Yes, they only take cash. Prices are reasonable...it's not like you got to walk in their with a wad of Benjamins to get a decent-sized pizza. No, this is not vegetarian friendly. I did not notice any vegan options...all salads featured dairy/cheese. There are no desserts on the menu, but plenty of near by places you can grab a cannoli. Service was easy going, friendly, and prompt. I would give more stars, but the menu was too limiting for me personally. Overall, this place is as advertised and there are no surprises.",4/13/2019,4,97,22,D41HComK7bNVvQi3yhVKmA
92,Hoa L.,1,5,"We stopped in at an odd hour on a weekday - about 5pm. It was pretty quiet except for about 2-3 tables around us. I had read that the prices were somewhat high, therefore this restaurant was not always too packed. That detail seemed to be true as our pizza was over $30 and prices ranged to about $15-30, depending on the size. Don't come here if your wallet is on a diet. Instead, find some $2 for 2 slices of pizza or a hot dog.The taste of the meal blew me away! We opted to try the clam pizza because it sounded special and we were craving clams. Well, at least we were after we read 'clam pizza'!Service was quick, we were seated and our drink request taken quickly along with our pizza order. I would say it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive. At first, we considered not finishing it due to the sheer size and magnitude of clams we would be eating. After a 30-second discussion about the fact that we really don't have any space to carry leftovers or time to eat them, we convinced ourselves to conquer the monstrous pizza.It helps that the pizza is thin crust, but not crispy -- chewy. It sort of just falls into your mouth and melts into bits of yumminess down your tummy. Clams tasted fresh and I did not encounter the cautionary sand Lombardi's mentioned in their menu. With a squeeze of lemon and a shake of red peppers, we were on our journey to consuming an entire cluster of clams. Or, maybe a cluster of families of clams would be a better description. It's not greasy, it's simple and plain, good pizza. No tomato sauce to detract from the clam flavor.",5/24/2018,174,504,1004,bVdfJwnjZSqO_H7OrQuV5A

95,Betsy B.,1,3,"Having a coupon for 10% off at Lombardi's and one of us really wanting  a pizza it seemed like a good idea to try it.  When we got there, it was crowded but we were seated right away in the back room next to the bathroom.  Since there is only one bathroom, there were often people in line behind us.  It wasn't too much of a distraction though.The waiter was pleasant and helpful.  My two friends shared a margherita pizza with a garlic spinach topping.  I wanted something different and had the calzone.  The calzone is similar to a folded over pizza.  One nice thing about it is that you can add 3 toppings at no extra charge (toppings on a pizza are extra).  I had the garlic spinach and mixed sweet peppers.  There was a lot of toppings in the calzone and the flavor was nice.  The tough was good but would have liked less topping and more cheese.  The portion was large-probably enough for 2 people.   My friends liked their pizza but I didn't think it was all that special.  The restaurant is historic which can make it worth a visit.  They have posted a number of awards and articles about it.  They are cash only.  Service was ok though the pizza for my friends came out well before my calzone.  It's a very casual place.  Prices seem a bit high especially for adding toppings.  The calzone was a good value since it included free toppings.  I was glad to try it once.",6/5/2018Updated review,53,551,996,IOoR8_05eltJPEvwSDCZjw

I dropped by recently on a random Sunday afternoon though and we immediately got a table, which was such a relief.I don't think there's such a thing as a shitty pizza at Lombardi's, so worth the wait to say you've done it!",12/5/2018,136,329,4,A4nxUeYN4uXXKvkNdmHapQ

The salad was a garden salad that had a generous amount of various garden vegetables: tomato, onion, mushrooms, and cucumbers. The pizza had a nice thick crust and a generous amount of tomato sauce which I like. The restaurant is small and we had to wait a short while for a table. The meal was somewhat expensive.

We started with the bruschetta appetizer. Best bruschetta I have ever had in my life! We ordered the white top pizza with olives and mushrooms - to die for! I wish I wasn't so full so I could order another pizza.Service was fast. Our waiter checked up on us numerous times and the restaurant was small and cozy.

The white was good as well but I found the cheese to be a little overwhelming. Overall, the pizza was definitely tasty but I think Lombardi's is a bit too touristy.

106,Tahira R.,1,4,"Authentic little pizza place nestled in Little Italy with loads of history! This place has been around FOREVER so I had to check out the hype! But caution -- CASH ONLY. Food: We ordered two pies for 5 people, one small and one large which left us full! We got a classic tomato sauce pizza and a classic white pizza. Personally, I was a bigger fan of the white pizza but others in my group preferred the tomato sauce pizza. Both, I thought were a bit bland though. I think the white pizza sauce could've used maybe some garlic and basil in the sauce and the tomato sauce was more sweet than savory. Cost: CASH ONLY!!!! (which was annoying but they have an ATM, try to hit the bank before you come though to avoid the fees). The prices were very affordable and I thought they were adequate for the amount and quality of the pizza. Service: mehh, not bad but I think they struggle to check up on people with so much going on. But despite being super busy, pizza was out in less than 20 mins! Will I be back? Probably not. It's a cute little pizza place to bring your family or friends but nothing special.

The parmesan on the table is extra stinky for some reason and the only thing that made this edible were the red pepper flakes I piled on. Save your money. Go to bleeckers, Julianna's, prince, hell... even artichoke to find a better slice worth your money. Price for a small Margherita with sausage: ~$26",11/6/2018,13,217,328,EBabfKfsqNyDORdjtcl4wQ

Forgot to mention we were 4 in total so mentally we prepared to eat two slices, well luckily we kept a menu and ordered an appetizer to ensure we don't leave with hunger. Upon pizza arrival, here where the hype went down pretty quick. First bite the pizza doesn't say much as far flavor speaking. It was well bland, literally the sauce was not making any justice.

There are far better places to go if you're craving pizza.We got the small original margherita pie and large clam pie. The margherita pie's sauce was tasty, but it was all cooked down and drained of moisture. This made the pie very dry and very underwhelming. The dough was also too crunchy. The clam pie was better, with a heaping amount of evenly spread clams, and nice with a squeeze of lemon. But it was again dry and in dire need of sauce.I will say that the iced tea with peach syrup was nice and refreshing. But the cost of the pies is not balanced by the quality in my opinion. I'd return to try the meatballs but pass on the pizza.",4/2/2018,139,211,947,4zu7xA2uDDVnnjeZSOQblw
118,Narim K.,0,1,"I came here 4 times.first time I came, it was just after 7 years in Canada (and ""Pizza pizza"" franchise is the barometer of Canadian pizza standard, which is quite shitty. I hope Canada has better pizza by now) so Lombardi's was way better than what I had for the previous 7 years in Canada..my scores would have been 4 stars at that time.And then I came here 3 more times over the years and now that I've lived in NYC for 8 years, Lombardi's is way way below average. Especially in coal-fired category.as a pizza lover, it breaks my heart that I have to give this low score THE FIRST PIZZERIA IN AMERICA, but this is out love. I hope they step their game up and live up to their history.It is a sad reality that Lombardi's and Grimaldi's are the ones that I recommend against to any of my visiting friends.",4/26/2019,114,38,0,2f67H1ksdzl98xltOxiNlg
119,Agta B.,1,4,"We had a guest visiting who wanted ""real NYC pizza"" so we ended up at Lombardi's. We were lucky, the wait on a Sunday night was only 10 minutes or so. We were seated in the back and had to walk through the kitchen area to get to our table. The smells were wonderful. We ordered the buddy pie with the prosciutto and arugula and a classic Margherita. The way to tell a good pizza place is to go for the classic and taste the sauce and the cheese and the dough. The dough was thin and crispy with a little stretch - just enough to lightly fold the slice. The sauce was fresh and tangy and the cheese was well melted with just a little bubbles burned. Delicious. The prosciutto pizza was good too. There was a lot of arugula and it contrasted nicely with the fat. I could have used some good olive oil to drizzle on top just to finish it off. We loved the food ... no wonder they have been around since 1905. The reason I took off a star is because of the service. Our server seems gloomy and not interested in anything once we told her we are not ordering alcohol. Also, paper plates, plastic cups? Not sure what it's about. However, the pizza is spot on.",11/25/2018,10,133,269,xlj1R2r-31KkTyoSPFZuRg
120,Blessy B.,1,5,"I've been dreaming about this place ever since I planned my New York trip. There was no way I was going home without trying the famous Lombardi's pizza. Luckily, it was pretty close to where I was staying. Margherita Pizza with meatballs. When the pizza was served there was just utter silence at the table because we couldn't talk. It was everything I expected it to be. The meatball add on was a great choice. The large pizza is good enough to share for four people. Definitely a New York staple. Lots of history at that place.",3/23/2018,873,296,984,jwNAw2CkV9obmNq_u4bbQA

I don't know about what happened but they gave TOO MUCH Ranch dressing. I'll be honest, it looked like they spilled the whole ranch dressing on the salad. I thought I was drinking soup so that was a No! The pizza is good, but had better. Not the best experience of eating pizza, but good service.",6/25/2019,157,29,3,BI8lIqm38J3AOMZhF5_yLA

Ok, so maybe I sound too much like a tourist, sue me, but I really liked the ambiance of this restaurant. The pizza here is phenomenal. We got half margarita, half pepperoni mushroom large and it was just enough for two. But that's because I can eat an abnormal amount of pizza and not get full...I basically ate all of it while my husband watched. But I think a large would generally be plenty for two I even got a soda (which I don't usually like/drink) because I was feeling so authentic. Root beer, don't judge! Back to the pizza: the crust was crunchy yet doughy, absolutely cooked to perfection. And everything else about the pizza was also done to perfection...the sauce to cheese ratio, the freshness and quantity of the toppings, just wow!!I want some now!!!I definitely think this place lives up to its good ratings on Yelp, you should check it out!",9/17/2018,77,415,399,tCBOlxGt4jM2B749s7mpcA

124,Justine S.,1,4,"Wandering around Little Italy and noticed this is where the crowd was heading for dinner. Cash only place.We didn't know this place at all but it was packed! Waited about 15 minutes to get seated. Seeing as this is the first pizzeria in America (founded in 1905), this was bound to happen. We got the table that you see once you cross to the other side of the restaurant space so.. a pretty bad table.Ordered the original margarita large with extra olives and prosciutto. It was very good but also very standard. Adam and I were also insanely hungry so we scarfed it down in like 10 minutes.It was a bit expensive for pizza, considering NY is known for cheap as dirt pizza.Although it is famous, it is also touristy and I'm sure this isn't the best place to get pizza.

125,Katherine K.,1,5,"No frills, cash only, tasty coal fired pizza. Perfect crust, full of flavor with the perfect char. Came here for an early lunch on a Friday and it was perfect timing, no wait and no rush. Ordered a wedge salad and their famous white pizza with pepperoni added. Beautiful looking pizza. I'm accustomed to having hot honey on my pizza, so I was slightly missing that hint of flavor but overall a five star pizza. Lots of ricotta so you have to enjoy that, with the white pizza. Would definitely get the basil mozzarella next time, it looked simple and delicious. Small pizzas are $23, salads (to share) $11ish, nyc prices for classic nyc pizza! We did have a problem with the bill, they over charged us by $20 but we pointed it out and they fixed it, I guess just review the bill- also cash only!

Cool ambiance, super sweet staff, and great service. I just wish it left me wanting more.

Place was only 50% busy at max, was the 10-15 minute wait scripted, because after waiting barely 2 minutes we were seated. We sat very close to the entrance and heard the 10-15 minute wait script over and over again.Phase 2:We had to wait very odd 10 minutes of moving our necks around like giraffes seeking attention for a place that wasnt busy. Someone finally did show up and we ordered our food and it came in decent time. Phase 3 (Pizza time):Pizza etiquette, serve me the first slice mr. Being pizza aficionados the pizza was below standards. The taste of the sauce and cheese just didn't live up to high expectations and reviews. What's even more disappointing is that once the pizza came our waiter never  came back to check on us until it was time for $$$$$.",9/7/2018,0,5,5,h4Xkj4bLLCKy9YmSSlAcXA
129,Natalie H.,1,4,Great service and amazing pizza. My only two complaints were it is cash only and you can't sit at the bar to eat.  Although they were very accommodating and provided us with napkins and plates so we could sit outside and eat our pizza.

130,Zahra W.,1,2,"One word to describe my experience: mediocre. I do not understand the hype. It took about 15 minutes to get a table for two, which wasn't too bad. When we got to the table, the waiter took our order. We ordered a large margherita pizza and just asked for water. He said that the cook time would be about 20 minutes. The plates and cups that they brought were plastic. It literally took 45 minutes from the time we ordered for the pizza to be brought to us. And that is not even the worse part. The cheese was somewhat burnt as was the bread. When biting into it, the pizza was so hard and crunchy, but not the good kind. Honestly, it was nothing special. I do not understand the hype. The pizzerias in New York that have a slice for a dollar tastes better. Would not recommend. This place was obviously the first pizzeria for a reason. Good pizza has come a long way since then.",2/20/2018,169,68,190,RkERC-XBMdXfw01mbSBAeA

132,Jenna P.,1,4,"The pizza is always fantastic. I love any pie with red sauce. I also love the small pepperonis they use instead of the larger ones you find on most pepperoni pizzas. This past week, my boyfriend and I  dined in again but we were very upset with the level of service that was provided to us. We had to ask multiple time for water, the waiter did not fill our water glasses when he came back, he never followed-up with us, and we were left virtually unattended to in the back corner of the restaurant. This is unacceptable, figuring the prices of the pies at Lombardis. Some friendly and hospitable service goes a long way. I must say, my last experience left a poor taste in my mouth - but judging solely on the pizza, this place gets 4 stars.

134,Lucy L.,0,1,"Pizza was flavorless! Being a New Yorker I would say I know what good pizza taste like but to be honest 99 cent pizza taste better than this. The sauce tasted like canned sauce and flavorless, like there was no seasoning. The only plus side of the pizza was the crust. Initially we were going to get a slice each but there was no option of that on the menu so we opted for a large pie. The ""large"" pie is not a big at all, roughly medium size. We also got breadsticks and sauce which is also a poor choice. Basic plain bread with canned sauce, if the bread had garlic and cheese it would of been worth it. Wasteful time and money. Skip this place if you want good pizza. Not worth the hype at all.",3/7/2019,97,22,46,qvNmRRMeXzlvyFMFnO1qOA

136,Christine S.,1,5,"No first trip to NYC would be complete without stopping at the first pizzeria in America. It was a bit out of our way to get there but was totally worth it. It was the only time we had pizza on our trip and I felt like we got the quintessential pizza shop experience here. The shop feels like old school New York, the pizza is huge and fresh, and the staff were very friendly. They were more then happy to let me walk back and snap a picture of the famous pizza oven. My husband and I tried the half white/half margarita with pepperoni added. They were both hits with us but I don't think I'd ever order just a white pizza by itself. It's great split like we did because you get a variety of flavors. I would definitely order the margarita as a whole pie though; that was a great basic pie to satisfy everyone. It also wasn't touristy in the least. We were seated immediately at 6 PM for dinner on a weekend. It's a great choice if you're trying to nail down a place to try NYC pizza.",9/12/2018,93,456,118,Bl7f80PfVAZ6kWK7aJfRuQ

I'm glad I can say I tried it, but I don't think it's worth it or as good as people say.We tried their Margherita Pizza (Small for $18.50) and it was just OKAY. To be honest, I think our pizza was really burnt. You could see the charred black spots of cheese on one side of the pizza and the bottom of was just burnt. The pizza dough offered really no flavor at all... I can say that I though the sauce was very fresh tasting and I liked that, but that wasn't enough to save the pizza itself.I think I prefer the street pizzas more than this place.

138,Sean W.,1,3,"I finally made it in to the historic Lombardi's. Founded in 1905, this is the first pizzeria in the U.S.! How have I not been here until now?!? Upon arriving at Lombardi's, I found an open spot at the bar. They don't serve food at the bar. Ok, back to the hostess. After asking for a table for one, the hostess points to a server waiving a menu, I follow. We zig, we zag. He hands me off to another server, we zig and zag some more, and I'm finally seated at a small table. Now I know New Yorkers don't mind a good crowd, but I'm sitting right on top of another table. Anyways, I'm here. Let's eat...I regain some excitement after my journey to my table. I see the vinyl red and white table cloth and think to myself, ""This is gonna be good."" I order the margherita pizza and add pepperoni. For a 12"" pie it came out to $21.50 plus $4 for pepperoni. Seems a little steep (even for New York) and it's CASH ONLY. Apparently Lombardi's hasn't upgraded their payment systems since opening in 1905. For a pizza that costs $25.50, that's pretty annoying. Was the $0.50 necessary? Ok, so the pizza comes out, and it's pretty good. It's on the crispier side which is fine. Good char, but the end crust is rock hard. The pepperoni cups were nice. Cheese and sauce were good. The pizza was good. Not great. I wait five to ten minutes for the bill, and the server starts calculating the tax. Now my $25.50 pizza turns into $28.80 or something like that. With tip I'm paying well over $30 for an individual pepperoni pizza. I'm sorry. I don't care if this place opened in 1905 B.C., it's not worth the price. And cash only...you're not selling slices. You're charging uneven amounts and tax? Come on. Lombardi's can keep the history and pictures of Jack Nicholson and Hannah Montana, but this place will never get my cash again because the value is not there, and the pie simply isn't worth $33 in a city filled with amazing pizza.",8/21/2018,12,145,133,B4S7n_hZzv33lP44Sulg1A
139,Joseph T.,1,3,We ordered the original margherita pie. I wasn't too crazy about the crust. It was thin and crispy but didn't have any doughiness and not much of a char flavor.

We didn't expect anything, which was a good move for us otherwise we would be very disappointed. Well, the service was terrible. Our server probably had a constipation, got a parking ticket, or a bad hair day, who knows? But we know for sure that he was not friendly, had a stoned face the whole time, and never checked back on us after the pizza was served. I wouldn't use the verb ""serving"" to describe our server. I would use the verb ""throw"" or ""bashed"" when he gave us a bottle of water, our drinks, and our check. Oh, and they use paper plates and plastic cups here, just so you know. As for the pizza, we got the cake boss or something, I can't even remember the name because it wasn't memorable. We chose eggplant for the toppings. It was breaded. The breaded eggplant took over the flavor of the pizza sauce. We might made a wrong choice for choosing eggplant. They also skimped on sauce and cheese and the whole pizza cost 35 dollars.

143,Dana L.,1,3,"I visited Lombardi's about an hour before closing on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away, but it seems like it'd be a decent wait if you went during peak hours. Also, be warned: this is a cash only place and it's pricey, so prepare accordingly. We ordered two large pizzas for four people: one original margarita with pepperoni and a white pizza with meatballs. We weren't able to finish all of them, but they made for tasty leftovers. I do think that this place is incredibly overpriced as each pizza came out to be over $30, but it is a touristy place, so I guess that's to be expected. In terms of taste they were good, but nothing out of this world. I preferred the white pizza and the ricotta cheese and fresh mozzarella were delicious. I'm not a huge can of thin crusts, but I know that's a draw for a lot of people. I would have liked to order the clam pizza, but it was only available in the large size, which I was moderately disappointed by. We also got some of the raspberry Italian sodas which were incredibly subpar. I'd say that if you're trying to hit all the popular tourist destinations, it's worth the time, but you can definitely get better and cheaper pizza elsewhere in the city if you don't care about the novelty of trying ""New York's Famous Pizza from America's First Pizzeria"".",10/20/2018,446,94,74,8yotJzdYmtsaCHIfJhNmCg

We ordered half margherita and half white.  Toppings tasted great.  Loved the slightly sweet tomato sauce. The slightly charred cheese on the white side of the pizza looked beautiful. But crust was not crispy. The sauce was too wet for the thin crust to absorb well. The crust was pretty much saturated with sauce. Sorry, but when a charred pizza becomes soggy, there was too much sauce. The crust appeared fairly dense, so if the crust was crispy, it wouldve probably been hard.  All in all, the pizza still tasted great. Above any chain or nice pizzeria outside of new york.At $26 for a small pizza was a tad high. And it's not like this is a nicer or a more premium place either. They serve you water and pizza with plastic cups and paper plates.  Even chipotle has nicer cutlery.

I've had better in midtown with a two slice and a drink special for $5.99. The sauce and cheese was meh and very sparse. I guess that $30 per pie is for atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we didn't get much of that either.  Our server got nicer as the meal progressed but he was rushed and didn't seem that thrilled with our party of 8.  Drinks were prompt, but we had to ask for refills because he was too busy to stay on top of them.

We ordered the clam pizza which was pretty good, I've never had a clam pizza before, it was good but didn't make me feel like wow this is amazing. The margarita was just okay.

160,Anh L.,1,5,"I've never been a huge fan of pizza, but this joint got me going crazy! Of course, when you think of New York, you gotta think of pizza; so I had to find a good pizza joint and I chose this place based on yelp. The inside is like a maze, we walked through so many rooms just to get to our table. Our server was friendly and he worked pretty fast. ORIGINAL MARGHERITA- fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, topped with grated romano and basil (toppings: beef meatball, coal oven sweet roasted peppers, and breaded eggplant)I absolutely love the eggplant. They were perfect and had such a meaty texture, which complemented the texture of the pizza. It was a thin crusted pizza that tasted very fresh, with hints of sweet and savory notes from the cheese and tomato sauce. The meatballs were very flavorful and went well with the sweet peppers. I can't wait to go back to NY for pizza. Never had I ever had such a flavorful pizza before. Definitely need to come back for more!",12/17/2017,759,1032,1932,2s27wyX1hn2lL1jv5Sn36w
161,Valerie R.,0,2,"My husband and I had a long trip getting to New York so we were starving and really looking forward to some delicious authentic New York pizza. We dropped our stuff off at our hotel and headed straight over here after hearing a recommendation from the lady at the front desk and also checking out the Yelp reviews. It seemed like a solid choice!Well, I just don't get it! Why all of the hype over underwhelming pizza??? They proudly advertise about the rave reviews on Yelp and Zagat but the flavor and quality of the pizza didn't parallel with what we were expecting. There was absolutely nothing special about the flavor..... as a matter of fact, it was disappointing! The crust tasted like cardboard, it didn't have any special texture or taste to it other than slightly being burned on the edges. They skimped on the sauce and cheese which is where most of the flavor is supposed to come from. The added mushrooms and pepperoni barely helped give some sort of life to the little flavor that it had. I'm just so confused!!! How could a place with such great ratings be such a let down? It was pretty expensive too. It was $42 for a small margherita pizza with mushroom and pepperoni, a beer, and an iced tea. Oh, and it was CASH ONLY! Also, service was average at best. We left there feeling like we had been ripped off. There are SO MANY other pizza places to choose from in the area. If you are reading this, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere! The food doesn't hold up to the hype and it's overpriced!",6/10/2018,337,202,717,E4oTk0GeZFYVcjCNnemRQA

164,Michael H.,0,4,"My only gripe with Lombardis is that it's overly priced for what you get. Margarita pizza is $25.00. Add on toppings is $5.00 each. That's why I knocked it to 4stars. Even with these prices, I highly recommend you go. Pizza was amazing. Everyone at our table thought it was one of the best pizza's they've ever had. Another reason to visit this place is its heritage. Open it's door in 1905 and I believe it's the very first pizzeria in the country.",7/4/2018,16,96,69,WODNYrYFdlkLsdfV018hUQ

Another thing they only take cash but they have been open for 100 years. Something fishy there. No refill on soda even tho I know they have a machine backer. I don't see this place last 10 more years. I do not remember it. They were good in the 90s but not in this era. Get with the times.,7/20/2018,20,118,318,XnZj6685Gsq7palG7btGug

There were pictures of a lot of different celebrities who've eaten there all over the walls. We had the half magherita and half white pizza. I loved the white pizza it was very delicious I think it was made with ricotta service was good considering it was packed.

168,Gregory D.,1,4,"Let's just remember one thing, America may have been very different if there was no Lombardi's.  It's claim to fame is being the first established pizzeria in America in 1905 by Mr. Gennaro Lombardi.  I had previously eaten at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, the first Chicago style deep dish pizzeria, but now it was time to eat at America's original pizza joint.  Lombardi's still uses a coal oven to bake it's pies.  We arrived about 1 PM on Saturday Afternoon and the wait was swift for a New York landmark.  You cannot tell from the outside, but there is both a backroom and basement.   We ordered 2 full pizzas.  One was half Margherita and the other half spinach, mushroom & meatball.  The second full pizza was the ""Our Famous Clam Pie"".  Since there was only 3 of us we had plenty of leftovers.  The clam pizza was absolutely delicious.  I had to look around for sand to make sure we were not on the beach, since the clams tasted so fresh and plentiful.  If you only get one pizza, I would suggest getting half Margherita style and half with toppings.  The Margherita style was my least favorite, but It was special knowing what the original pizzas tasted like straight out of a coal oven.  I felt like I was taking a DeLorean back to 1905 New York without the crime.  Each pizza has 8 large slices, so you will feel more than satisfied if you split the pizzas in half.  Make sure your wallet has green, because just like the in the 1900s they only take cash.  This place is a must stop in New York.  Why not be a part of history?",5/30/2018,66,114,2947,hH9zBzoeHngbuJPtvAtzDg

Also ordered the margherita pizza in a small which is 6 pieces. Clam pizza has no shortage of clams. make sure to add the lemon on top, which really brings out the flavor of the clams. The margherita pizza was good, but not amazing. We were seated downstairs so service was a bit slower because there weren't servers or waiters down here very often. However, they did have pitchers of water so that was a huge plus. The highlight of the meal was definitely the clam pizza! Try it!",12/11/2017,420,1573,3022,P4Td3m5oMGZGTfDVZzgztg

Upon arriving we had no wait, which is extremely rare from what I'm told, and immediately sat down near the window. I asked what type of oven they had and to my surprise I was given a small tour of the oven. This of course elevated my personal experience. I ordered the Neapolitan pizza and asked them to add pepperoni. The crust was perfectly balanced and the tomato sauce was everything on this pizza. The aroma it gave off as well as the burst of flavor made this experience a great one. The mozzarella was placed evenly around so that every slice had some as well as the pepperonis.

The crust was really hard and the sauce not really flavorful or tasty. Not to mention the big price tag it comes with. A large pizza was $25 I believe and we had to get 2 to fill 6 kids up (even then one or two more slices would've been more sufficient). The wait was extremely long and the seating kind of cramped. All in all, it was a very just... okay experience. We got two margherita pizza with meatball (get it!!!) and pepperoni (letdown!!).",7/5/2018,997,213,161,UNSS9ClaT6GPD-I2sB8nkw
178,Brittany T.,1,2,"2.5 stars, I feel bad for giving it such a low rating but it really was disappointing and just ""Meh.""WAIT - came on a Saturday around 5pm and the wait for us 2 was 15-20 minutes. They give you a little buzzer but it really doesn't have a far range (only near the restaurant).  ATMOSPHERE: The inside seems small at first but when you walk further in, there is another section of tables.  For a larger group it's not impossible but I can see why the wait is long because there isn't a ton of seating and the pizza takes a bit of time to come out.FOOD: I got the small (6 slices) with a half and half of Margherita and white.  It came out in about 10-15 minutes and was hot, but not piping hot where I couldn't eat it.  What was disappointing was the fact that the crust was almost too dry and hard.  I guess it had that ""coal oven"" burnt taste/feel but it wasn't that good.  I prefer fluffy, chewy, slightly crusty crust.  I'm even OK with crust that is crispy like at Bleecker Street Pizza, but this was just not good. On top of that, the ingredients had little to no flavor.  Again, comparing it to Bleecker Street Pizza, the sauce had barely any taste and the white pie was even worse! The white pie had a slight cheese taste but it needed more garlic or something to give it flavor.  I would not pay or wait for this.Overall, not impressed with this pizza.",11/6/2017,1402,825,1536,PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg

181,Chloe L.,1,4,"As a pizza addict I HAD to go to the first pizza joint in the US (est. in 1905). Being a popular place it was packed, as to be expected, but they seated us quickly. Once there, they really nickle and dime us over everything. $8 for a cheap house wine, $10 for a pitcher of soda, $4 - $6 per topping, etc.We ordered a 12"" half and half. Half white and half margarita with pepperoni (which they charged the full extra for even though it was only on half). The pizza took a bit come out which is completely understandable as it is oven baked fresh, but we didn't see our waiter while we waited. Even upon sitting down it took a full 7-10 min before he greeted us. The pizza itself was two experiences. The white pizza was a let down. There was almost no ricotta cheese on it. It didnt have any extra herbs or seasoning. It was just basically a mozzarella pizza. The perfect example of why my husband is so cautious when getting a white pizza. The margarita though was a WHOLE other experiance. The fresh herbs were there, the sauce was tangy, the cheese was gooey and bubbly. The pepperoni was spicy and salty which complimented the tangy sauce and gooey cheese.  It was exactly what you expect in an excellent pizza. The crust was perfect, a really traditional New York style.Again, it was another cash only joint so no points or cash back for us :-( Honestly now that I have experienced it I don't need to go back to dine in, but we would order out for sure!!!",1/2/2018,150,171,585,tsuYY_fsDDoUGRShGlPvJg

192,Bowie W.,1,5,"PROS:- Very good service. Our server was so kind and polite. Lots of smiles from the staff when we came in and during our meal. Very pleasant experience- I expected this place to be smaller since it seems like a common trend w/all famous pizza places in NYC to be extremely small with no seating so this was such a pleasant surprise since we were on a NYC pizza hopping adventure and we had to eat outside for every one of the stops we've made so far and it was one of the coldest winters in the last couple of years so it was great to just be able to sit inside and be warm and out of the 8 degree winter weatherCONS:- None that I could come up with! Great service and great food!SPECIFICS:- Original Margherita = Now THIS is the original NY style that comes to mind whenever you think of NY pizza. The mozzarella was melted to perfection and leaves a long string when you pull away from a bite. The sauce has a sweetness to it, rather than sour like how most red sauces are. The sauce to bread ratio was perfect. There was plenty of sauce but it wasn't deep dish and stuck to the original thin crust style. The crust was thin and crispy although it might have been just a little over cooked since some parts of it was a burnt. Another plus was that it was not oily at all like most of the pizzas that I've had. I didn't feel oily or heavy after eating here nor did I feel overly thirsty from excessive saltiness.

L's definitely ranks toward the top of my list, but no way does it beat Prince St. or -- one you don't hear mentioned as much but as good if not better than Prince IMO -- NY Pizza Suprema.Lombardi's is also not a slice place like the rest. You have to sit down + wait a while to get a very pricey pie, + if you aren't smart + you don't cough up the extra dough to add spinach and mushrooms to the margherita (seriously, do this -- you won't regret it), you're more or less SOL.It's a slice of history, + a very tasty one, but Lombardi's doesn't have the same no-BS slice-joint vibe that I'm looking for on a typical sleepless night in NYC.",11/1/2018,198,12,0,jO6Ail_hXd5wWdAtVOrJig

Pretty decent with lots of bruschetta but I wasnt wowwed or anything. I actually didn't see nor taste any cheese on it. -clam pizza (~$35): Honestly expected more. Yes they stack the pizza with tons of clams, but was missing that extra kick for me. Tasted like clams on bread with some skimpy cheese. I understand that this would further emphasize the clam flavor, but it just tasted  bland. For $35 for an 8 slice pie, I don't think it was worth. -Brooklyn lager draft is $28 a pitcher Service:Friendly host, decently friendly server.

206,Tasha M.,1,3,This is a cash only pizza joint but dont let that stop you from visiting. My group and I were lucky enough to find seating during the busy lunch hour and our waiter was polite and brought us drinks right away. My only gripe is that they serve you with paper plates and plastic cups which took the classyness out of the restaurant. In addition there are no free refills which is almost like taking away an American right! We ordered a large pizza with half and half of two types. The margherita and white pizza with sausage which was the best choice and got to try both. The white pizza was by far my favorite and adding meat gave it more flavor. I wouldn't say it was my favorite pizza joint but worth a visit for first time visitors.,3/29/2019,115,177,498,lCe7EcHq1NK8JUpr_gvq-A
207,May C.,1,3,"Came here for dinner one night. Met up with a few friends for dinner at 7. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded yet. The dinner rush is a bit later - around 7:30 to 8 pm (if you're not from the NYC area, keep in mind that everyone loves to work late). I like the ambiance of the place - well lit, checkered tablecloths and toppings on the side. Felt like a very traditional pizza place. The space is pretty limited; they like to pack you in. The table of four felt very tight, we were packed right up next to each other, but it would be big for a table of two.We ordered half white pizza and half margarita with pepperoni on top. The margarita was pretty good, it was the right amount of saucy. The white sauce was a little disappointing. It was just ok in terms of taste, it was a bit bland to me. The crust was also extremely dry. It was ok with the margarita because the tomato sauce would balance out the dryness, but there's no sauce on the white pizza and the crust felt impossible to eat. Pretty much like tastier cardboard.Overall, it was pretty decent pizza, but nothing to go crazy over. Service was pretty slow too throughout our dinner.",5/22/2018,515,718,689,qzjMPTmaZ6o-zNfQEPeALA

I am from here and just had lombardis for the first time.... not better than a lot of dollar pizza, sadly. Maybe my expectations were too high? It's not bad, it's just not ALL that it's hyped up to be. The crust was overwhelmingly hard to chew. It was very tough. The taste was just basic. I can make better pizza.

I have no regrets but it is slightly expensive. I got the calzone, and with a tip it was $19 to be filled which felt spend although the ricotta cheese inside was soft but not overwhelming. It was cool because in the calzone you can pick any two toppings (even two premiums, so I got the meatballs and bell peppers). They went well together especially since the meatballs had breadcrumbs you could taste.  Not your casual slice of pizza since it is slightly spendy but it is definitely a place to bring your friends from other states who think they have good pizza there.",2/12/2019,265,161,400,GUO6W0OLRA8fg5yXtvkTiw

The white pizza was my favorite - ricotta makes everything better. It was messier and thicker than I was picturing for traditional NY pizza, but it was delicious.

Really old school w checkered table clothes and def doesn't give the fancy feel so it's casual and nice. The utensils are all plastic and they give paper plates. I'm a fan of real utensils so this was a low point for me. I ordered the small half original and half white pizza w sausage and pepperoni. The white slice was the best white slice I've ever had. The portion was small but filling. The classic didn't have much cheese but was good in its own way. Def lighter than the white slice. I was very satisfied with my pizza. The service was alright. The waitress forgot to give me back change and then swore she had already so that was a small hiccup but she went back and got it for me eventually and apologized.

Maybe it was because the pizza ordered was without any extra items.  The tomato sauce was fine and tasty, the pizza was light on the cheese and really pretty flat tasting overall.  Crust was the NY oven baked, and thin but just unremarkable.  I'm on a mission to find a better slice next visit.  I read that Rubirosa is good and on a later evening we peeked inside as there was a 1 hour wait.  I also read the Prince Street Pizza serves a good by-the-slice pepperoni.  The  $8 Stella in a glass was, well a beer in a glass and not a Stella mug or chalice , you know what I mean.",4/3/2018Updated review,88,147,57,VSgUIuwDiMBG7mAGxGqwqQ

233,Daniel C.,1,4,"What's one of the foods that people often think about when they talk about New York? Pizza!Everyone talks about the pizza in New York and it's always on Food Network/Travel Network so I arranged our itinerary to have pizza as our first dinner in New York. Lombardi's had to be the pizza joint we went to for our first real taste of New York pizza. We were very lucky because when we arrived, we secured their last available table in the far back so there was no wait for us. The party behind us had to wait at least 15-25 min to dine here so we got lucky.We both enjoyed the ambiance and decor of the place. Personally I really liked looking at the pics on the wall and admired the brick wall since most buildings in New York exposed bricks. The menu here is very simple and the servers were very helpful in guiding us on what to order. Keep in mind that this place is old school and cash only! While deciding, I ordered a Brooklyn lager as recommended by our server. I'm not a huge beer drinker but it went well with the pizza. We shared a pizza where half was their original Margarita so we could say we tried it and we added meats to the other half. The meats on the other half included meatballs, sausage and pepperoni. It was amazing and Mink said it was the best meal she had in NYC. The pizza was so good that we overlooked the fact that they give you paper plates. Ingredients are fresh and the meats complimented the simple pizza perfectly. Must try spot in NYC!",12/8/2018Updated review,750,716,1380,I_4cXopXxFr5B7adXZ1ruQ

This was our first stop upon arriving in the city- we got here around 3 pm-ish and we were seated with no wait. Our server was friendly and did a thorough job of explaining the menu along with providing recommendations. We ordered a large pizza; a split of their margherita and white pizza with meatballs as a topping. The ricotta on the white pizza was amazing and the meatballs paired perfectly. The sauce on the margherita side almost had a tangy flavor but surprisingly tasted really good with the cheese.

I ate 5 slices on my own, and I have a small stomach. Aside from that, I love when the cheese just melts in your mouth. Lombardi's was not that. The cheese was tough, and honestly was a little bit cold after only 10 minutes.

The pizza came out relatively quick and upon my first bite you can tell the toppings were fresh but I wasn't really that impressed. At $35 for the whole pie, I expected each slice to be darn good. Being in NY for 4 days I've tried a lot of pizza, pretty much anytime I saw a pizza joint I would grab a slice and this place is near the bottom of the list for me.

This is a nice pizza  place but not the best in New York imo. The best thing about it is the sauce but it doesn't make me want more of it.,8/11/2018,39,91,36,I84jfEnl-d0OLAAhKl801A
256,Chris S.,0,3,"I love Run DMC. I wouldn't trade them for all the multi-slant-rhyming lyricists in the modern world. We might value the complex evolutions grown from seeds sown long ago - but other rappers must kneel as they pass Run's house. Lombardi's Original Pizza - The crispy craters of crust are singed in a tasty way. The crackly crust is covered with a thin layer of unseasoned mulched tomatoes. Six slices of fresh mozzarella the thickness of Kraft singles were added, and wisps of oven-dessicated basil complete the toppings.Is this enough?With this little cheese, it would need to blow my hair back. Closing my eyes, I'd need to soar over rolling fields of grassland zoom into the twinkling eye of one angelic cow. I didn't pick up an incredible standard of quality to the ingredients.Mom-and-pop Italian joints in Wisconsin use great mozzarella, make their own signature sauces, and charge less for four times as much pizza. Lombardi's might just be Sugar Hill Gang to me. Worthy of respect for being there first, but only providing so much to appreciate.",12/10/2018,4,103,0,0raxI0uiOG-HLVdJD55i3Q
257,Jessie H.,0,5,The pizza here was amazing. The sauce was super fresh and the crust was perfectly crispy. I came here with my Mom after our walk through the tenement museum and it was the perfect stop. We waited a bit for our food but it was fresh and hot when we got it. My mom is a vegan and they were very accommodating so that she got half of our pizza with veggies and no cheese.,4/15/2019,0,10,5,ZSIRVxjeemihKE2JmiQgog
258,Jennine R.,0,4,"We came to Lombardi's on our final day in NYC, having no idea it is apparently the US's first pizza place. Congrats for staying in business this long. They must be doing something right! We kept it simple and ordered a white pizza with ricotta and a margherita pizza. Yum! Sauce and cheese was fresh and tasty. We'll definitely pass by on our next visit to NYC, and order some more elaborate pies.",12/7/2018,1,19,30,aFhIOzZTBnVn5iT6Nrtkwg
259,Gerardo C.,0,4,First time to New York I had to try NY pizzaThis place was recommended by my wife's friend that lives here in NY. After reading a few reviews we decided to visit Lombardi's. Pizza sold by the pie only. We ordered the  original with Sausage Spinach and Mushrooms. You pay extra for each topping. Only had light beer in domestic bottles not Tap. Pizza was tasty. Place had a good vibe around 9:45pm overall nice place to visit. Reason for 4 stars is waitress could have been friendly with a smile. She looked tired or not wanting to be there. No cc accepted Cash only.    Review for Friday 8/10/18,8/11/2018,0,6,0,wlURnU794lbzFwGbJ-8b4g
260,William K.,1,5,"Today was my first experience at eating NY thin slice pizza and I'm glad I chose Lombardi's pizza to be my first! The food was a little pricey, but the quality of the pizza was superb. Easily the best slice of pizza I ever had! The cheese and sauce went really well together and it had a ton of seasoning on it. The crust was crunchy, airy, and also tasted great on its own! Overall a very pleasant experience at Lombardi's and will definitely be visiting again?",4/1/2018,5,107,23,5oeHZy48WNutMowW5ApjfA
261,Michael H.,0,3,"Being the oldest pizzeria in America, this place was top on my list to try.  I also visited a few other top rated Neapolitan style pie joints, and while not my favorite, I thought Lombardi's was very solid.  I tried the pepperoni and mushroom.  The pepperoni had a nice crust around the edges, the sauce was very fresh tasting (I believe they use imported san Marzano tomatoes).  Also, very impressed by how evenly the pizza was cooked.  Would like to note, we visited this place around 2pm on a Saturday.  For being a big tourist spot, I was really surprised that we only had to wait 5 minutes or so to be seated.  Also, the restaurant was not busy at all.",9/11/2018,1,27,67,Jf6WyzIb0SxkfwB3fehOyw
262,Raquel O.,0,5,We came on a Tuesday around 1 pm and only waited like 15 mins. We ordered the Margherita pizza with pepperonis and it was really good!

263,Michelle K.,0,5,"AMAZING Pizza. So many people have eaten at this place - it's definitely a place to try. I have to say that Prince Pizza was better for me, but you can sit down here.

265,Terrance P.,1,5,"I thought Vezzo was the best thin crust pizza I've ever had in NY but this has taken over the top spot. We came here after easing that it may be one of the oldest pizza joint in NY. After a 30 train ride on a hot and humid afternoon we made it and was immediately seated by the host. We had just made it before the rush. Paul, our server, was the epitome of what a server should be and was not only the friendliest person but had the perkiest attitude. Their selection was plentiful and lol appeared to be good. With the recommendation from Paul we went with their famous ""Clam Pie"". Absolutely the best pie I've had hands down. No sauce just clams, lots of it, and garlic. The crust was amazing, thin and crispy. I was skeptical at first since there was no sauce but man I tell you, it will not disappoint. Why can't we get this out here in CA!!! I'm definitely coming back and highly recommend.",7/21/2017,116,361,2692,AxJeHgu4LEj7G03JlQoC-A

267,Doug D.,1,5,"My favorite type of restaurant is the old school Italian one in the neighborhood that just survives all these years and keeps going.  My mom says that you can tell why such a restaurant has lasted all these years despite all the competition.  In the Northeast you can a few of these such restaurants in each older city.  In Atlantic City it's White House Subs, Angelo's, and Chef Vola.  In Philly it's Ralph's.  In Baltimore it's Sabatino's.  In Trenton it's DeLorenzo's.  So, in New York it's Lombardi's.Although it may be true that tourists come here by the herd, it is not inherently a touristy place.  They just read about it in the guidebooks.  The same people are not going to equivalent restaurants in other cities. They come here because it belongs to New York.  They are located outside of the midtown area, which I like.However, the pizza really is top notch.  I absolutely enjoyed my meal.  I also like that wine was available, too.  One hint is that you should get there right away when they open at 11:30 am.  That's the only way that you can fight the crowds and get served quickly.",6/6/2017,855,510,1782,SeWsQoYPbQuMAqfRNNS6Jg

We had the Cesar Salad, Bruschetta and Margarita Pizza, all incredibly delicious. The place doesn't have too much appeal, disposable plastic cups and paper plates. I am not complaining, it was perfectly what we were looking for at the moment. I'd defiantly come back for a quick bit. A must stop if your in the area.",4/6/2019,58,81,1,l89mUiWgFQIIjg6XuUaHAQ

273,Leena T.,1,3,"The margherita is admittedly good. Simple, fresh and basic and delivers on taste.On the other hand, the dough doesn't handle its water releasing veggies very well---add any onions or peppers and your pizza is soggy before it even comes out. Did we enjoy the meal? Yes. Now, is it worth the price, however? No.I might be prompted to give a higher rating if the experience called for it, but being served expensive as all hell pizza on paper plates and an expensive as all hell bottle of wine in plastic cups just doesn't cut it. Additionally, cash only policy--- they're obviously loaded, the class can be upped a smidge.",7/24/2017,53,249,302,iDmeUeE0JXOwcRmX0Nwuhw

275,Sarat Chandra V.,1,4,Lombardi's is a popular nice pizzeria in the NYC East village. This place is claimed and famously known to be the first pizzeria in America and has often been featured to be the among the best pizzerias in NYC. They serve good pizzas of 3-4 basic types with a huge array of toppings  choice. The place is vegetarian friendly too. It has good ambience and good rustic old school Italian sit down dine-in restaurant charm. Best time to visit the place is late afternoon to skip the long waits and the place is cash only.,3/10/2018,178,62,264,yvoM5RLtqUsdnfgmRcPaXA

While the margherita was below par, it was a struggle for us to finish the white pizza. In fact, we had to take home 2 slices of the white pizza. We were bored of the white sauce and powdery cheese very quickly.The dough was too chewy, and a lot of burnt edges too.You would have a much better pizza at Rubirosa just around the corner.CASH ONLY too.",8/6/2017,415,418,732,XcwBT1a_5ZjdaPZTZOhN-Q
278,Charles Q.,0,3,"2 stars for the pizza, 4 stars for the ambiance, particularly during the holidays. The pizza is seriously not among the top 30, or probably even 50, places I've had in NYC, especially when factoring in price. A large pizza (that can be shared between two) with two toppings will cost around $35, and is not really all that good. That said, during the holidays when they have the lights strung up and it feels like you've stepped into a time machine, the restaurant is a nice place to be. Service is good as well. Another negative here is that everything feels kinda cheap - paper plates, paper cups for water...only the utensils are metal. Makes sense in a slice shop but a little disappointing in a sitdown place. Would not recommend if you want delicious pizza (seriously there are like 10 places within a few blocks of Lombardi's that have better pizza), but would if you are looking for a place that gives off those old NYC vibes.",12/10/2018,0,17,1,aW07GVniGZRcjnVluHri-Q

285,Jeff O.,0,5,"The Pizzeria That Started It AllThere are many great pizzerias in NYC, but this is the one that started it all. And it still churns out a good coal pie. You can trace the lineage following Lombardi's to many of the best pizzerias in NYC including Antonio Pero of Totonno's, John Sasso of John's on Bleecker, and Patsy Lancieri of Patsy's (who then begot Grimaldi's then Juliana's from Patsy Grimaldi) and modern legend, Sal Gianci from Salvatore of Soho. These pizzerias, in turn, have created many more pizzaiolos. There is something to this lineage.Along with Katz's Deli, Lombardi's is one of the top NYC food tourist attractions that actually lives up to the hype ( my god, Pastrami on rye at Katz's, there is no other ). My advice is to get a pie loaded (like the clam pie) and bring a wad of cash (ATM out front). You don't really have to be a purist to eat here, you just have to have relax and have a good time. Go wild with white pies and calzones. It's fine. And tourists, let me tell you something aboat a NY pizza - specifically a coal pie. Unless completely charred, be grateful for the blackened bits on the crust. These ""leopard spots"" are moments of intensity for flavor. You want this. Savor it by not swallowing so quickly. And if you return it to the kitchen, call me up and I will gladly send you on your way back to Boston. The wait can get long, so I recommend going on a weekday or at an awkward time. But if you're already Saturday at 1pm and it's too crowded, trek down 2 blocks to L'asso - it's less busy and a great introduction to pizza of the new school. Come back to Lombardi's tomorrow for lunch.Opened: 1905Distinction: First pizzeria in the United StatesNotes: Coal pizza oven gets cleaned from 4-4:30pm. Wait til 5pm to order another pie.

The small 6 slice Margherita we got was over $21 then an additional $4 for pep. We got it after a really long wait and, sadly, it was nothing special. We tried about 10 different pizza places during our stay and this was one of the blandest, most unimpressive ones we had. Anyway it's cool to try I guess for the history behind the pizzeria but they lack flavor. The service was pretty good so 2 stars.",1/2/2018,74,58,11,JHvoUpO6lL-X7v8ay6WxAw

We ordered a white pizza with sausage and mushrooms, and a margherita with meatballs.Crust is on point and closer to what actual Italian pizza should be, but that's about it.Expensive toppings, decent sauce, mediocre interior--the FIRST THING this restaurant wants to have you know is that it's the first pizza restaurant in the US. This does not substitute for a good slice of pizza, unfortunately.Save your money (cause this shit is expensive) and get a gritty slice of $2 pizza at a much better pizzeria down the street anywhere but here.",12/8/2018,107,6,0,BlFTFHXg87xb5Rw-iM1KAA

290,Eric V.,0,3,"This was a ""don't miss"" pizza joint based on a few recommendations. We ordered the margherita pizza, a veggie calzone, and an order of breadsticks. The service was good and is likely the reason this place is getting 3 stars rather than 2. The marinara that came with the breadsticks was the highlight. When our margherita pizza came it was simply unremarkable. The crust was a big letdown as it seemed little different than what you'd get at any national chain. The veggie calzone lacked any character. Again the crust was very uninspired. Certainly wouldn't recommend Lombardi's.",3/26/2019,75,6,0,LDybD2XB9mqUdP1AXRIkHQ

Was so excited to visit this place. Came early around 5 pm and was fortunate enough to be seated immediately. Ordered a pie of the white pizza and original pizza. Ended up with a disappointing food experience overall. Both pizzas were average at best and I've had much better in my local town. Overall the pizzas here didn't come close to living up to the hype.

We asked the waitress about when it would be ready and she ignored us and was very rude about it. There is no space here either, I felt very squished and kept pushing my chair in to let people pass. After an hour passed, we had to get to our tour so asked if we could just get it to go. We ate it while walking to the subway and all the toppings were sliding off I was left with just the crust. You'd think for waiting an hour for this pizza I could eat it but it was very sloppy and greasy. However, it was good pizza. If you're thinking of coming here don't come from 4:30-5:00 and be ready to splurge on sloppy pizza",10/24/2018,0,6,23,EBw6JHQ2dMxx5S_4DwQvfg
298,Sharon C.,1,4,"Lombardi's is worth at least one visit and since a out-of-town friend was on the prowl for her first New York pizza experience, this was our top pick in the Soho region. It's known to be America's first ever pizzeria and I think it lives up to its legacy because they're still serving up some pretty darn good pies. We came here on a Wednesday after 1pm and were pleasantly surprised there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Two friends and I split a small (12"") margherita pie ($22.50) and a side of Grandma Grace's meatballs ($11.00). The pizza was amazing- classic New York thin crust with the perfect amount of tasty tomato sauce, basil, and mozzarella. I could have easily finished the whole pie by myself because it was so light. The meatballs were great but a tad pricey for what they are (two four-ounce meatballs). Overall, Lombardi's is a great choice for people looking for a treat and being able to say they've been to the first pizzeria. The cozy atmosphere, classic decor, and friendly service are pluses and make it an even better dining experience.",5/26/2017,446,92,208,Y9VVaJY4hbCzzWKXTSfTyQ
299,Tina W.,1,4,"Mama, I made it, to another pizza icon shop here in NYCI got so many good feedbacks from friends that I know I have to be here one day. Location: it is usually packed or people are waiting outside fiercely just for the pizza on a weekend but during the weekday, if you are here early enough - like 6pm, you will get seats quickly.  Decorations are old fashions : you can see all the famous people taking pictures with the owner. The smile from the owner made me wonder how good their pizza is because I doubt you can make anything special in a thin pizza dough. I was wrongPizza: pepperoni and white cheese pizza is incredibly goood. I first thought that I love pepperoni better but I can't stop thinking about white cheese pizza after I finished my first slice of perpperoni. Why? I guesss it's the enormous cheese and the density of the food quality cheese made me wanna eat more?What's even better is that when I felt so full that I still can't stop eating. Yeah, it is that good!Service is caring and nice. They even have a bar.

Of course, there are many equally great or even superior tasting pizza in New York---duh, it's NYC---but you cannot deny the tastiness of Lombardi's margherita pizza. It comes out hot and fresh. The crust is thin, crispy, and lightly salted (so it tastes good on its own too). There are heaping amounts of mozzarella cheese on top. Tomato sauce is a good complement to the rest of the pie; you don't end up feeling like it's dry pizza. As opposed to the many $1 pizza slices in the city, you get to sit down and enjoy it with friends. Lines can get long, but it's worth it even just to try once. C'mon, it's ""America's first pizzeria.""",6/14/2017,233,132,305,8-DlA9VJSiBx0uRouWLKmA
303,Sarah C.,0,4,My first taste of authentic NYC pizza did not disappoint.  We ordered the our white pizza and the original margherita pizza.  Both pizzas were cooked well and had very crispy crusts.  The ingredients were fresh and their tomato sauce was some of the best I have ever tasted. The venue is a fun as the tables are spread out throughout the building so you get a glimpse of the kitchen and all the little areas if you get seated upstairs.  Our waiter was friendly and we were delivered our pizzas promptly.  We had a great experience and will definitely be back!,4/7/2018,0,47,97,v2shbux0UmowVrzec2hWpQ
304,Nathania Y.,1,4,"No visit to NY is complete without trying New York style pizza and for the best one; we tried the first pizza place in America: Lombardi's pizza. We came in at around 8.30pm on Friday and the line was about 15-20 minutes, so not too bad. The place was huge with downstairs and upstairs seating area. We ordered the large Original Margherita with extra toppings (sauteed garlic spinach, fresh wild mushrooms, pepperoni, and sweet italian sausage. The three of us barely finished the whole pie because we already ate a small dinner before.The coal-fired crust was definitely one of the best we have ever tasted.

307,Trent T.,1,5,"The pizza experience at Lombardis was just that, an entire experience. This spot was so much more than just a quick bite in a beautiful neighborhood. From the second we walked in the door the staff was accommodating and made the experience that much more enjoyable. We were hitting a few pizza spots in the area to see what we have been missing out on over in New Jersey. As much as it can be a hassle getting over to the city, places like Lombardis make it well worth the trek. It was mid afternoon and we came in expecting to grab a slice and move on, we ended grabbing a table and a small pie. We were seated in the upstairs area, which was through the restaurant and even through the kitchen! It made you feel like you knew someone there! We sat down and ordered our pie, well well done just the way we like it. It took about 15 minutes to come out, and it was absolutely perfect, thin crispy and bursting with flavor. Lombardis delivers an excellent thin crust pie, I am not sure if I can deem them the best on the planet as they boast, but they're definitely well up there. Nice staff, quick service, excellent pizza. I would recommend them 10 times over.",4/25/2017,55,201,468,No1a5ujVTjbuOiJCFOhbrg
308,Chad E.,1,3,Not a fan. It was drive and fairly flavorless. It had decent crunch and texture but the sauce was barely any there and rather bland. Just a few dollops of mozzarella and basil put on in strips so it just burned and lost all it's flavor. I'm good with simple but this was simple and not great.,2/12/2018,7,145,43,_pkwfwQx9--_sueH4yJ6hg
309,Emily M.,0,3,"Cash only!! Get with the times. I thought their pizza was alright. You can't order by the slice which is super annoying when you're just trying to grab lunch and don't want to try to consume a whole pie, sitting down for an hour between two people. I thought their pizza was good. You can't tell their the first pizzeria other than the decor. Super limited pizza menu as well, so be prepared to add some flair to your order. Overall, alright.",7/23/2018,0,47,24,s7ypKeJatb0SIxdjL4MEFQ

311,Frank O.,1,4,"Okay, it's very good pizza, but not the best. I have had flavors and ingredients on other NY brick oven pizza that was better. I have to cut this place back one star for a few things.Do you really have to use so much plastic? You are charging $25 and up for pies and you can't save the planet and provide glass for that?It's an original place, and maybe a place you have to try once, but I would explore the many other brick oven places around this area before coming back to Lombardi's. We had the mushroom and sausage margherita (red) pizza and it was just perfect for 3 people, and yes the char was amazing on this pie. It was gone in under 5 minutes :).Service here was very efficient, and the ambience, well it's a classic as far as New York Italian goes, you won't be disappointed with the ""space"". ENJOY! but explore more.",6/22/2017,137,409,849,7w2bpsiu6E2Kx0WscxAIqA
312,Christopher B.,0,3,"Pizza was good, server and staff were quick and friendly, business was booming! If you want to experience Lombardi's for the history and nostalgia, go for it! The place is cash only, not that it's a big deal, but be prepared to spend a good amount just for pizza -- I think a small cheese was 21.50. I'm happy to say I experienced it but have no plans to return. I can grab a good NYC slice in many other places while saving some time and a lot of money!",6/25/2018,48,133,22,eOq-b5ifWIo1GyKqef8Qmg
313,Jay H.,1,4,"I had this bookmarked for some time and I held off from visiting this place due to the long lines. I finally went a few months ago and I have to say the pizza was good. I did wait for 20 minutes but once seated, the service was prompt and friendly. I had the clam pizza which is loaded! It is a hefty price but at least you get more than a few clams on your pizza!",8/6/2018,3,64,41,DUUpi-6_Kd7ALUxW401a6A
314,Shaan S.,1,4,"Being the first pizzeria in America, gotta say it was an experience to see the place the brought the best food group across the big pond. The service was great, our waiter suggested what we should get which I'll recommend to you: get a magherita pizza and throw on some toppings. you won't be dissapointed. They also have specialty pizzas that have pre-picked toppings. The place has got nice music. Strangely enough they only do cash, serve you on paper plates, but have metal silverware... (confused?).So the pizza is thin, maybe a little too thin and had some moisture from the fresh imported tomatoes they use but nonetheless still great. The mozz is chewy but creamy enough to make you savor it. The show stopped has got to be the marinara sauce though, which you can buy in a jar. Recommend this place, but brings lots of cash because it'll be a lot haha",4/19/2017,244,145,520,AhyBe-uGYDJ44MpVXMflkA
315,Del O.,1,5,Lombardi's was a highly recommended restaurant from a family member who lived several years in New York.  I don't have much experience in New York style pizza but this was a dang good pie.  We arrived and we were immediately seated.  The waitress was great and our food took almost no time at all.  We were in and out within 45 minutes of visiting and it was reasonably priced given the city we were in.  This is definitely a place worth visiting when in New York.,8/3/2017,234,89,93,9bym1dhEBJvutxToAuIhug
316,Robin D.,1,5,"We loved Lombardi's!We wanted authentic NY pizza. After stopping in desperation for a slice of sub par pizza the night before, it was great to have Lombardi's redeem our experience. Lombardi's was highly recommended and it did not disappoint. We were able to get a table without a wait right at lunch time on a Saturday. I have no idea how that happened, but we were so happy!We were there on a warm spring day and were seated in a weird area in the back of the restaurant. It seemed like it was above the kitchen. Even though they had an AC unit running in the room, it was HOT up there. We were SHOCKED when our pizza took only a matter of minutes to arrive at our table, even though they were obviously busy. The pizza was delicious! It was exactly what we hoped!  On the downside, there is only one restroom for the whole restaurant. (But it has a picture of Miley Cyrus in the restaurant above the door.) The toilet was backed up when we were there, which meant some of us just had to wait until the next stop to be able to use the restroom.",5/20/2017,108,347,116,3MTUmYnuqcb3jiv4nnwb7g
317,Jared W.,0,4,"We live outside New Haven Connecticut, so we know pizza. Lombardi's does not disappoint. We ordered a standard large pie with sausage and spinach. The flavors were outstanding and the crust was cooked perfectly. (No burned crust!) it may be my favorite pizza ever. But that may be my hungry stomach speaking. Service was so-so but not bad considering they were busy on a mid-Friday.We'll be back for sure..",8/31/2018,102,97,50,Zb9JN1tv8E6rGlLK3QonsA
318,Terry B.,0,4,"It can be a 5 or a 3 depending on the time of day. A must for any pizza addict even if just to say you've been and now you can compare it to other great pizzas. When you go, and when you do not go is the most important thing to know about this place. The quality of your pizza hinges on what time of day you order it entirely.STAY AWAY WHEN ITS SUPER BUSY - THAT'S A 3 STAR PIZZA.Can't stress this enough. Save yourself a long wait by avoiding the lunch and dinner rush, or if you must, get there early enough that you are one of the first people seated. This is a true coal oven pizza, and the thing I've learned is coal ovens have longer waits due to the need to allow enough time for the coals to reheat before you put another pizza over the same spot. Though it has a much more touristy convenient location, this place has never had the lines as long as I saw at Grimaldi's back when it was family owned. This has been attributed to them not allowing the coals enough time to reheat. Doing this may allow for more rapid seating, but it leads to a mediocre, unevenly cooked pizza during the busier times. That is likely the cause of the many three star reviews posted. I've been here on those days.GO WHEN IT'S SLOW - IT CAN BE 5 STAR GOOD!Perfect time to go here is mid afternoon like 3 PM, or a slow time well after dinner. Slow times are the key because I have had some of the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life here. THE PIZZACash only, No Slices. $22.50 for a large Margherita. It's a sauce heavy, thin Crust, Neapolitan pie. Very full tomato flavor, nothing watery.  Some days the crust is just right, some days it's not crispy enough for my liking, but when they are on it's one of the best. The cheese is spread out in little pools of fresh mozzarella. I could swear they used to put more cheese on these pies. Fresh basil is sprinkled a bit unevenly in small snippets throughout. You can tell just looking at this beauty that it's made with high quality ingredients. I've had the pepperoni toppings in the past and it's the good stuff that curls up into tiny little cups in the oven.THE HISTORY AND LOCATIONYes, this is the first of the Original Coal fired pizza places, but that does not make it the best. I love history, especially the history of NYC so I can appreciate going to this place just for it's importance in food and the city's history. However, it's worth noting that this is not the original location. They were closed ten years and have been here since 1994. Don't expect a time warp when you come see the place. Lots of pics of celeb's on the wall, but other than that it's a dressed down version any other red-checkered table cloth, quick service place in Little Italy. THE VERDICTA solid 5 at it's best, a let down of a 3 at it's worst. Go at a slow time and you'll have some great pizza, but don't make this your one pizza you must eat when you visit NYC. John's of Bleecker Street is much better, and so are Rubirosa and Prince St Pizza right around the corner. Come here for the history just as much for the pizza. At the right time of day it's worth a trip.",11/16/2017,1184,113,1212,PbXWKMJS_HqqKCcy2lj0RA
319,Lanissa E.,0,2,"I found Lombardy's on a food blog and decided to try it.  My husband I both ordered water, which was brought to us in what looked to be an old glass milk bottle.  That was a nice touch, the black pieces of who knows what, was not.  We showed the waiter and asked for two sodas instead, foil me once.  No apology and the other pre-made bottles were not replaced, not a good start.  We ordered a small pizza, half with red sauce half with white with pepperoni, prushetta, and sweet Italian sausage.  It was just average, not the best I've ever eaten, but not the worst either.  The bathroom was unisex.  I waited for a mother and little boy to leave only to find the toilet seat up and urine everywhere.  I decided to do my business, food and otherwise, elsewhere.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day, sadly we'll never know because I won't be going back.",7/22/2018,77,116,82,l-c_MiSlszEnth3qiGRg-g
320,Joyce D.,1,3,"They pride themselves on being America's first pizzeria. So we had to visit here and try our share of NY pizza. Before trying Lombardis we had already tried different pizza joints and fell in love with NY style pizza. This place has separated dining room areas to accommodate more tables for customers. We ordered a large pizza and the salad. The salad was fresh and crisp which is what we need to accompany our pizza. The mozzarella itself is fresh as well and creamy in texture. As most of the other yelpers noted is that unfortunately it kind of is overpriced. It's a high price to pay for some pie.What really dinged on this review was that our waitress made a mistake and gave our pizza away to the wrong table. She ended up giving it to the table right behind us. We were waiting and waiting and flagged down 2 different people to ask where our pizza was. No one really had an answer for us and just told us they would check on it or ask our server. It wasn't until maybe a half eaten pizza in that the table behind us realized that that wasn't there pizza. When they brought it up to the waitress she realized they gave the wrong one and gave our pizza to them. We were frustrated because we know we ordered before that table behind us so we were wondering for the longest time how they got their food before us. On top of that, our waitress didn't really check up on us. We waited to try and flag anyone down just for a refill on our water. It seems like they each have their own tasks because the one guy would say he would have to ask the other guy to do it. It just felt like a lot of miscommunication on service. Onward towards the pizza, it's cooked similar to a Neapolitan pizza from my perspective. It had a almost doughy texture on the inside different from the crispy texture I was used to to the other NY pizza joints. It seemed like the pizza itself was a little to burnt to my liking that you can taste burned crust. Not sure if that was the taste they were going for.Would I recommend someone to go here for their first time? Yes, just to get the experience of America's first pizzeria.Would I really want to come back? Probably not.",7/24/2017,232,307,95,Y0MzRiIzdvj-wlMEUt4C_Q

326,Yoona K.,1,3,"With all the popularity surrounding Lombardi's, decided to finally try it out during my last weekend trip to NY. Like some reviews have said, super overpriced for not that amazing pizza?? We ordered the Small Original Margherita to go for $18.50 (plus tax). They are CASH ONLY so make sure you have cash before you dine here.As the first pizzeria in the US, it was definitely worth a visit but I will not be dreaming about the pizza here. The Margherita took about 15 minutes to bake and we ate it outside on the small bench next to their entrance. Upon taking the first few bites, I concluded that personally, Papa John's is better LOL. It was definitely good because it was freshly baked and had a ""clean"" taste, but nothing spectacular. I think the pizza would taste terrible cold... Would I recommend people come try the pizza here once? Yes.Would I come back a second time? No.",7/11/2017,298,181,604,PZUV833B5n4QnB8scSNvXQ
327,Giacomo C.,1,2,"Meh. And I mean: meh. I wanted to go because of its history and fame, but I was bitterly (and predictably) disappointed. Sure, as a New York City landmark (inexplicably cash only since freaking 1905) this place receives much attention, but it's just a mediocre pizzeria with an inflated sense of itself. The service is slow, the vibe touristy, and the pizza nothing special. I've had better $1 slices in the city...multiple times. We ordered a large pie, 1/2 original margherita and 1/2 white pizza. $25 of average quality over below average quantity of ingredients. The basil was barely noticeable, and one slice of the margherita came with so little tomato sauce that all I could see was the white dough. The waiter offered to bring us additional tomato sauce, and even bragged about not charging us for it. Did you really think I was going to pay for it? Wow...how generous of you. Never ever ever again. Don't listen to the hype, and go elsewhere. You'll save money and precious time (luckily I only waited 10 minutes to get a table).",2/8/2017,1816,1281,3028,gpR3XkOEdw-PCJGUjhYcgQ
328,Kady W.,1,4,"Friends chose this place for dinner on a friday night. Wait was around 30 minutes give or take. It didn't matter to us as we were chatting  and enjoying the night's breeze on the sidewalk. Walking in, the waiter lead us to the downstairs dining area. We ended up ordering the antipasto, small 1/2 Bianca & 1/2 Margherita , and the arugala pizza.The antipasto had a nice assortment of meats, cheeses, and olives which was appreciated since other places just slap salami on a bed of iceberg and call it a day. When our pizza arrived I immediately dove into the Bianca slice first and it was everything I wanted and more! Usually bianca slices are bland with their unseasoned blobs of ricotta, but this slice was oozing with flavor. I don't know what they do , but the ricotta had this whipped texture that made it light and almost fluffy. Hands down, bianca was my fav pizza of the night!

330,Mike N.,0,4,"What can I say, it is the first pizza place in the United States. That is so cool and the main draw for this place. The negatives: paper plates, plastic cups, old cheap booths, no refills for soda -why?, and cash only. I hate cash only places and they scream that they won't report the takings, but it is obvious the reason here is because it has been here for so many years that they have never converted from cash to credit cards. That is respectable, I like the old school Italian vibe it gives. Love the ambiance of this place, I felt like I was in my Italian grandma's basement waiting for her to serve me up some delicious grub. Did I mention this is the first pizza place in the U.S.? They definitely know how to make an Nepolian-style pie. Nice and crispy crust and some charred edges from the brick oven. Man was it good. Opt-in for the large pizza, as it is enough for two hungry folks after trecking around lower Manhattan.

Prove to me you're paying them a living wage while you charge this much for only several items. Until then, I probably (and sadly, because I truly love this pizza) won't return to your restaurant.

340,Peter C.,1,2,"Definitely a tourist trap like what the other reviews say. Apparently is America's First Pizzeria since 1905. Got their Large White Pizza with Pepperoni and Sausages which came out to around $40 after tax. The crust of the pizza was a little hard and tasted burned and overcooked. They were also very stingy on the toppings. For a large pizza, there was barely any meat. For the toppings, they make it complicated and confusing. You basically cannot split the pizza toppings for the price of a single topping. It will be full price for both toppings, even if you only want it on half the pizza. They give paper plates and plastic utensils for you to eat off of. The servers were not very interactive with the customers, had to ask them to refill water or to get napkins. I would say take your friends suggestions and go to Joe's Pizza or the $1 pizza shops. Our visit was quite disappointing and I would even say a $10 Combo Pizza from Costco tastes better. I guess this visit takes one thing off my NYC bucket list. Almost forgot to mention, they are CASH only like all Italian places. They have an ATM with high fees for those who forget to bring cash.",11/13/2018,381,436,208,TT8sKcoUdI0qyYFocu86iQ

I loved the menu - not too much and not too little, but just the perfect amount of menu items so it wasn't overwhelming.I love a classic margherita pizza so had to go for that. The crust was baked perfectly - a perfect amount of crunch and not too doughy. The dough was so good that I bet it would be delicious to dip in EVOO. Great ratio of cheese to sauce too (didn't skim out). The sauce wasn't overly salty either, so you could actually taste the tomato. They use chopped basil instead of whole leafs, which I like. The pizza was exactly what I was hoping for!Pizzas come in two sizes: Small and Large. The Small was perfect for two people - I felt nice and full. Got there just before the rush and waited only 10 minutes for a table. Overall, I would recommend you go try it out!",2/21/2017,190,145,303,mTy1msUA0ogqVtY4KLkmUQ
345,Ronit M.,1,5,"Came here w/ my boo for a night out on the town. We rode the nostalgia holiday trains down to Houston and 2nd Ave and wandered our way to this pizza place. It looked busy and good, so we gave it a try. We got a lil' buzzer and waited about 15-20 minutes before getting a table in the back room/alley.We could not decide between a margherita pizza or a white pizza with a tomato topping, so we got 2 in 1. We saw a picture on the wall across from us, and it looked so good we asked for a replica. It was just as good as it looked on the picture. I'd definitely come back for this. We also shared the iceberg lettuce salad w/ bacon on the side. My boo ate the bacon. It was yumm. The water service was good. The space is a lot larger than it seems. Restrooms are downstairs, but we didn't go. Waitstaff and bar attendants are helpful, friendly, kind, and passionate. My boo tried one of their mixed drinks - it was seltzer, w/ raspberry syrup and whipped cream. We were so full by the end that dessert was no longer an option, though we (not so) secretly hopped and popped into nearly every cannoli shop in lil'il and checked out the ""Rice to Riches"" shop across the street.Happy eats!",12/21/2017,93,262,1147,zh4Agl3sSlYobtgLlePKFQ

But in reality, by the time we got served here, 25 mins for a pie, we could have ate a quality pizza. Didn't go on my usual yelp recommendation, and that's where I failed! First off, for the price they charged for the tasteless pizza, they serve you on paper plates and Dixie cups! Really??? The pizza was not only flavorless, it was soggy. Today most places serve their sausage out of the casing! This was sliced. So tasteless. We ordered a large with mushroom and sausage. For $31.50.",11/12/2017,82,316,1855,eOUAJ8R2EPR2pxi43PCl7A

So needless to say, I left satisfied.However, after trying other pizzerias in NYC and coming back a second time, I now don't see anything special. Surely, not bad, but not extraordinary. Also, $20+ for a small Margarita Pizza with no toppings is expensive for what it's worth.Definitely worth trying since this is the first pizzeria, but there are now also plenty of other options.",11/11/2017,308,182,224,obnGkCYM9S_xpZz-GRlpbQ

I would have to say I've had better.  The crust and red sauce was good. The selection was limited and if you wanted to add more toppings, it cost about $3 more for each. I felt they skimped on the toppings.  They serve their pizza on paper plates (felt like I was a kid at Chuck E Cheese) perhaps it is to keep the cost low(?)...not sure because the pizza was expensive. We also ordered the meatballs...average,  but the sauce was good. When we got the bill, it was totaled wrong (too high) when we paid, they gave us too much money back. I wish I could rate it higher because of all the reviews. Unfortunately I couldn't recommend this place based on our experience.",1/1/2018,83,88,84,zse49p-boaT-51MAB6PRNw

354,Darya S.,1,3,"They say you'll never forget your first time eating at the historical landmark that is Lombardi's. For me, it was on a snowy Saturday night in January after I was out celebrating my 27th birthday at Bleeker Street Bar around the corner (formerly reviewed). Lombardi's is open til midnight on Saturday nights, and if you go up until 11:45pm, they won't kick you out at midnight. So my three friends and I decided to go. Their service is undeniably friendly and prompt, minus the capitalized CASH ONLY sign, but I expected the place to be bigger and cozier and more Italian. Got the classic margarita pizza, large, eight slices. Perfect for four people. Their slices barely have any cheese, especially compared to Grimaldi's, but their cheese is more flavorful. Also got an unsweetened iced tea, which was refreshing! I think $25 is obnoxiously expensive for a thin-crust pie, and don't get me started on $4 a topping. Yes they've given into the mainstream. But it's not a bad option if you don't feel like trekking to Grimaldi's and are craving thin coalfire pizza.",1/8/2017,1005,2128,1644,wce0tudXf9BCeWhQRr0TiA
355,Laura B.,1,3,"i'm a sucker for all thing superlative-related. ""best's"", ""first's"", ""oldest's"", etc. after researching online an endless sea of ""best pizza in NYC"" lists, i decided it was too overwhelming to pick just a *good* one... so fuck it, let's go to the first! lombardi's, here we come. first thangs first: cash only. second things second: they're very strict on their ""we only seat complete parties"" rule. i had the host, the lady who seated us, and my server all ask me where the rest of my party was within a 2 minute time frame--which seemed a bit overkill. regardless, we didn't have a wait. they attempted to seat us immediately, just to discover the table was occupied (i believe hostesses communicate with some kind of walkie-talkie system--it is a LARGE restaurant by NYC standards), so we went from a cool rooftop-esque room to a windowless below-ground basement set-up that was hotter than the 7 circles of hell. a quick note: the ""salads"" on the menu are $9 and served family style. when they brought the bowl out (which was tiny by midwestern standards heh), i was confused. i never saw our bill that night--so to this day i'm unsure of if they charge ONCE for salad, or per person? regardless--it's a small salad you self-serve. FYI. we went with the buddy cake boss or whatever special. the clam pie sounded interesting, but the threat of sand/rocks printed on the menu warded us off. lol.the pizza itself: thin-crust. light on sauce. heavy on arugula. not greasy at ALL. i commented on this a few times... after 2 slices i felt good, which is never the case with my digestive system and pizza. i didn't want to die. it was a nice feeling. we opted for breaded eggplant in place of the offered prosciutto, and everyone commented on how that was a great decision. it was a delicious addition. overall: i've certainly had better pizza. but have i ever had pizza from the oldest pizzeria in the USA? now i have. good experience.",12/15/2017,44,197,321,uIVB_fub0nZWnN_AxPRtCQ

They have an ATM on site though so just keep your wallets and purses on you and you'll be fine. No Apple/Samsung Pay here! It's worth the step back in time. This pizzeria is magical. It's usually a little bit full and takes a second for your pizza to be made but not enough to age you. They have a sweet staff and fascinating pictures on the walls, it's a very nicely aged restaurant. Once you get to eating the pizza, that's when the true experience begins. It is golden and addictive, and that is even more fulfillable because the pizza isn't heavy enough to make you feel full, so if you want to keep going you will not stop.

359,Laura G.,1,1,"We decided on the ""famous"" clam pizza and the margarita pizza. The prices are a bit high and they only accept cash. If you order a soda it costs $3.00 for a small plastic cup and they do not do refills. We ordered the soda pitcher for $10.00 because we thought it was a better deal. I really thought that both pizzas were boring and lacked flavor. The margarita pizza barely had any cheese and they did little to build on flavors. I could not taste the basil or Italian seasoning of any kind. I could see flecks of some type of topping but could not identify a flavor. The clam pizza was a pizza crust with a million clams on it... literally a pizza crust and clams... no cheese, no sauce....nothing pulled it together to make it worthy or show any imagination. Adding the lemon juice on it did little to enhance flavor. I was extremely disappointed because I expected so much more. Two small pizzas, one pitcher of coke cost $85....With tip.

We were lucky to come on a Thursday early afternoon to avoid the crowd.We ordered the pepperoni. They still use coal ovens to make their pies too. I do think that the crust is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's the best. I didn't think they had enough cheese on the pizza and felt that pepperoni was very thinly sliced and pretty salty.

I think everyone should try it. (Caesar salad was meh) the waiter was very friendly and we talked about pizza faux pas (eating your pizza with a fork and knife.

368,Andrew S.,1,4,"Yes, fine I finally submitted to trying a Lombardi's pizza. The first registered pizzeria, huh. Is it any good? The answer is basically when I was a kid I had a pizzeria around me that had pizza made by an Italian immigrant who spoke little English and I compare all pizzas, even the new age, creative ones and the different category pizza like Grandma slices and Sicilian slices.I actually really liked it in that the core of the pizza was soft with a slight chew. The sauce was thick without clumps. The cheese had a taste but it was neutral and the basil with char on the bottom gave it a similar taste to childhood in comparison. It did have that old world Italian slice taste. And the crust at the end was crisp and not overly chewy.For the famous pizza. Yeah, it's good.

Honestly,  I did not enjoy anything about this place and I'm not sure why anyone would recommended this place.  It's all touristy to me. Let's start out with the wait...  Long... Second,  pizza.  We ordered a small pizza, 6 slices,  which comes with the standard motz cheese, tomato sauce and a few sprigs of basil for 21.50... Holy cow, and if you want any type of meat,  it's 5.00 EACH ITEM (I think, can't recall) , sausages 4.00 EACH ITEM and veggies 3.00 EACH ITEM. Let's say,  if you get too crazy with the toppings,  you can end up with a $40.00, 6 slice pizza - easily! The thin crush pizza comes out piping hot in about 15-20 mins but it's pretty bland. After calculating 2 sodas served in a small plastic cup with no refills,  the pizza served on cheap paper plates, the amount you pay for your meal doesn't warrant the amount I spent.If u have money to splurge,  don't come here!! Its not even worth it or even worth writing in the books...  I don't recommend it..

For main course we took the white no sauce pizza with peppers , olives and spinach and the margherita pizza with  similar additional toppings. Both were medium size 12inch pizzas and had like 6 pieces each . The smell was just alluring. On top of that, the no sauce pizza comes with ricotta cheese that is slightly burnt using a  flame torch and it looks marvellous as a topping . The taste itself is amazing especially because of how well their zesty olives go with garlic spinach and ricotta cheese. The flavor explodes inside the mouth.

Words can not express the disappointment in the food we ordered, but I will try.The crust is thin and chewy which I heard was New York style. But the sauce was deplorable. It was little more than tomato sauce spread paper thin and tasted sour. Mozzarella Cheese was rectangular and about four slices dotted the sauce. When you bit into the pizza the cheese slid across the thin sauce and pulled off in a blob, so we, and those next to us, folded the slice and ate it like a sandwich. If this is Authentic Italian Pizza, then I do not want any more of it. Even though we were taken in by the media hype proclaiming it the best pizza in NYC, we were FAR from impressed. If I could have given it a zero, I would have scored it as such.I was so looking forward to this place after everyone raves about it! What a disappointment.

Granted I prefer a thick crust to a thin, but this was overdone and stood straight out on it's own. The pizzas were very overpriced. Wine by the glass was decently priced.

While eating there gave me the vibe that they just wanted you to eat and get out so the table is available asap. Second is the pizza, it's pretty mediocre compared to what I have tasted around Europe. Sorta pricey and the pizza was kinda warm, borderline cold may I said.

New Yorkers are gonna hate this - but there are lots of places in the L.A. region that are far better too. As a former managing partner of a highly rated restaurant, I know food.

When we found a table to sit at, we waited for a few mins...no menu, no water, no place setting...nothing. I can tolerate below par service, but this was essentially NO service.

The wait was longer than we were originally told, if they are busy they open up the basement seating which lacks the atmosphere you expect, and sometimes it's hard to get the attention of the servers because they are so busy. Maybe something to try once, but I wouldn't go out of your way or feel bad if you've never tried the pizza. Oh, and it's cash only.",3/5/2018,0,34,23,gON__9un9eJt_luvuVZ43Q

It seems as if they are running on a past reputation and not living up to it; definitely not the place it used to be. Disappointing to see the use of plastic cups and paper plates; I know they have high volume, but I was disappointed.

I went at 9pm and I still waited 10 min for a table!  (long enough to order a beer at the bar).  Overall, the pizza is very good but not life-changing.  Boston's pizza game is just as strong in my opinion (there are less places to rave about, but it's also a much smaller city)",9/25/2017,222,628,123,T5flbqIKLXshktBV00qAKg

418,Julia T.,0,4,"Laugh at me if you must but, while in New York, I had to fulfill the quintessential 'what tourists should do' experience. And, what better place to do so than at one of America's first pizza joints for the perfect slice of pie? Staying near Times Square, we chose Lombardi's since it was closer than Prince St. We came around 7:40PM on a Thursday night and found it lively as ever. After a 40 minute wait, we were seated and ordered the Margherita and the Cake Boss Special with eggplant. While I've had pizza in Italy, my hometown of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is hardly the mecca of good pizza so I expected to be blown away. Although the pies were good, I was a little underwhelmed. The margherita was tasty but, nothing spectacular. The Cake Boss one at $35 definitely did not feel like it was worth the price particularly since the eggplant was soggy and difficult to eat on the thin crust. So why did I give this 4 stars? Well, we had quite a bit of pizza to take home (4 slices of each) and we found the next day pizza MUCH better than at the restaurant. Plus, the service was very friendly and I don't have any other NYC based pizza place to compare it to. So, check this place out if you haven't heard of better. And if you go, make sure to get either the white pizza or the margherita. Skip the Cake Boss.",2/14/2018,63,81,6,Qvzq9Ufc8gcraiesYjt0eg

When you walk in you're met with a bar, and tons of pictures on the walls lol. It's rather rambunctious in the front, and so it was nice to be taken to the back (think of a wide hallway of tables on either side).We got the Original Margherita small pizza (14"", six slices). It had fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil.The waiter asked us if we wanted water, when we said yes, he asked us what kind. I replied with, ""Water...?"" And he said, ""I need to know if you want tap, bottled, or sparkling."" Tap is fantastic in New York, so we asked for tap.I was disappointed in the pizza. It was perfectly cooked, the crust had a nice bite to it, but I thought the crust from Pizza Cafe was much tastier and had more flavor. Also, the pizza didn't look appetizing. There were these shriveled bits of basil on top, and there were only about five pieces lol, which on a 14"" pizza looked awkward.

A lot of chili pepper and salt had to be utilized to make it palatable. We were going to order the clam pie but decided not to when the menu warned us that there might be ""sand"" on the pizza along with shells. The sides were pretty terrible as well.

Sure ok no problem.  The waiter were alright nothing spectacular as we had to keep reminding them we needed drinks and lemons. The appetizer of breadsticks came out and they looked good but they were cold. Not sure if that's how they come but they would have been much better if they were warm. On the other hand, the dipping sauce was amazing! Finally 30 minutes later our pizza arrived and looked delicious which it was. Tasted fresh and very light which is what I wanted as we had more walking to do and the traditional greasy slices would not have sit well.

I do not get that hype... my guess is this place once was amazing now they are just making a killing off of tourists. I can't imagine locals going to his place!",3/4/2018,0,8,0,dR_wU26RDsWu77GAHRm1fQ

Food comes out quick.Margherita w/ Pepperoni & Kalamatta Olives, small - $18.50 + $4 + $3 - Dough was good but not crispy like it should have been. The sauce was good, clean and simple. Nothing beats fresh mozzarella. Pepperonis and olives were pretty standard toppings. Pizza quality was decent, but for almost $30 bucks, I wanted to be blown away.

I came upon Lombardi's while I was scrolling through yelp. Heard good things so I wanted to give it a try. The first time I came here (which was in June,) the place was packed with people waiting for hrs. I decided I wanted to get the pizza to go, only to find out that they don't sell slices of pizza - they sell it in pies only. Disappointed I didn't get to try it the first time. Second time around, I got a seat less than 25 mins for a table for two. I ordered a classic wedge salad, classic margherita - topped with meatballs and garlic spinach. Wedge salad is definitely not worth it for the price. Ingredients are so simple that I can easily buy them a make it myself.

The pizza is thin crust and not over power with sauce. It is well balance. They have space upstairs and the decor is very old as this place has been around for a long time. This restaurant is historical as it is the first pizzeria opened in 1905. Service is prompt and efficient. The only con is that this place is cash only.,3/6/2018,124,133,218,rCJd3UN1dXY4X_0KZG_YCA

I'm a big fan of New York pizza and honestly believe that we have the best pizza. The place wasn't too crowded and the space is pretty big compared to most Soho restaurants. I ordered the small Original Margherita for 18.50 to split with my boyfriend. It comes with 6 slices but for 2 people the small is pretty good. If you were having this as dinner or lunch this probably isn't going to fill you up but we just came to stay in from the rain and to have a bite. The service here is pretty slow. It wasn't too crowded and although we finished out water jug they gave us it took a while to flag someone down. It took a while to order our pizza as well. This place is also cash only which can be super annoying but be prepared. I don't think this is the best pizza in the world because I prefer my pizza to be thinner and crispier.,1/8/2018,441,380,833,D4C_M_i6lz7tWurRUaO-XA

Especially if you are looking for a pungently sour tomato flavor that is a cross between old canned tomatoes opened back in 1905 and tomato paste from your bodega.Cheese had its perfect cheese consistency but lacked any flavor whatsoever.Crust was made of dough and was neither light nor crispy nor flavorful. It was made of dough.As for service - it took us three asks to get Parmesan cheese to add some flavor to the pizza and anchovies which the Cesar never came with.To recover from lack of taste we went a block over for a slice of prince street pizza.

I understand that they are trying to keep it authentic and old school but it's very common right down to the plastic table cloth and paper plates for the pizza. You would think that when you're charging $22-$35 for a small pizza they could maybe invest in real dish ware? Outside of that, the food was fresh and fine. I never spice or salt food but I felt the need. The sauce was very tasty.  I would suggest some on the side for dipping. We got the margarita, white with added pepperoni, 2 calzones and wine. Again, it was very expensive for what we got. We were hoping the price meant we walked away with something unique in addition to great food but we got a subpar all around.

Supposedly one of the oldest pizzerias in NY this place is no frills no bullsh!t pizza. On my last visit I went and had the white pie and was blown away. Often white pies are sort of bland being that its usually nothing more than ricotta, mozzarella, and probably some oregano. This white pie was more than that. The cheese tasted super fresh and not from a container. The dough was perfect and the chew I look for in a perfect pie. To top all of that they even scalloped the ricotta!The selection is small which is fine by me.

We arrived about 2 pm and the place was packed....with tourists. They weren't even wearing a sign that said ""I am a tourist."" It is just obvious. We forgot our sign but I have no doubt that we were equally obvious. Service was slow to get started but once the order was taken things moved along nicely. We started with a wedge salad and it was by far the best I have ever eaten ($11). The blue cheese dressing was sweet and bit tangy from buttermilk. Huge amount of bacon. Everything was excellent. We split a ""small"" margharita pizza. First, small is large everywhere else. Second, it was really good. The crust was crisp and stayed that way, even in the middle. Often with margarita pizza everything slides off, but not this time. The sauce had flavor as did the crust. Best margharita pie I ever had, although it's a bit pricey at $21.50 for a small. We each had an adult beverage, a glass of draft beer is $8. I had the Brooklyn lager and it was perfect with pizza.So the entire bill with tip was $60 which is not cheap for a pizza and salad, but I am glad that we visited and can cross it off the bucket list.",6/3/2016,242,1393,2358,eZGoPMRfq2hw5LfwJg0uTA

I usually grab a slice from wherever I am in town. But tonight I searched out one of the legendary places and Lombardi's was the choice. We had it delivered to our hotel. They quoted 45 minutes. They were here in a half hour on a Sunday evening. Simply put the pizza is phenomenal. It had fantastic flavor in the sauce. The meatball topping was to absolutely die for. You're damn right I would eat this again. What kept it from 5 stars? Well, for $28 for a 14 inch pie, they kind of skimp on the toppings a bit. Plus, it didn't beat out my all time favorite pizza, Frank Pepe in New Haven. But it is probably top 5. Maybe 4 1/2 stars is appropriate.",5/15/2016,379,1010,297,ppsm8EDKjA1fp1yTCP3RrQ

491,Alex T.,0,4,"When one is in New York, one must have some pizza? But where when pizza is every where in nyc like every block? . This is one of the place i would come here, why? Well the history behind it, their service, the inside, and the pizza they serve. 'Tis is the regional location as well so it makes it more special. . Well if i cam by myself then maybe i will get a personal size pizza, but when i am with my new friend of course we order a big and share it. Before we came here i was browsing the menu and i saw clam pizza which has over 3 dozen of clam, i am sold. . when we got here there was only one hr left, so i ordered the clam pizza , which comes with no sauce, served on a thin crust pizza with lots of garlic, fresh olive oil, and basil. Every bite of the pizza was a crunch sound like your biting into a chip sound. The aroma is so garlicky and yummy. The clams was just all spread evenly so you don't even need to pick around with your fingers to make it even for every bite. The only thing missing was maybe some marinara sauce to dip my crust in. Anyways amazing quality for the high cost price $43 bucks i believe for a large size. . Overall it was worth coming to a independent first pizzeria over 100 years old. Serving something authentic and not your normal pizza was what capture my attention. Also a side note, there is a wonderful massage place near by so pizza and massage, what more can i say. Come here and give it a try and see what y'all think and let me know. Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day.",6/11/2018,1363,1096,7663,gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ

It looked like the toppings were thrown on there with no care. The cheese tasted cheap. When I asked for sausage on the pizza, well just look at the pics. Smh. This place is only popular because it's the first pizza place, but they let the quality slip. Only giving a 2 because the service was good.",12/22/2017,12,214,605,ub8pTdjEv2jsLYLHLODzhA

496,Vivian C.,1,4,"After watching a food documentary on Pizza, I had a huge craving for authentic, delicious pizza and realized I had never tried Lombardi's before. My boyfriend and I tried the Clam Pizza (based on the recommendation of the waitress). If you love clams, I would highly recommend trying it - though I would also would have liked to taste some of their more ""traditional"" pizzas. The pizza was very filling and flavorful and they do not go easy with the clams. The lemon wedges really complimented the taste of the claims/garlic and I love how crispy the crust was.

Our group had the margherita and I felt like it equaled some $1 pizza eats in the city. However, it's apparently the first pizzeria in the US so pretty cool.PRICE - Pricier than I expected. ~$22 for large, 8slice margherita. CA$H ONLY!!!WAIT - Came Sat @ 9pm & still a 30ish min wait. Not too bad.Overall I am satisfied with the place, but what I really feel like saying is ""well, at least that's checked off the bucket list now!""

498,Michael S.,1,2,"Celebrated as America's first pizzeria, Lombardi's Pizza is a NYC Mecca for pizza pilgrims. It's legendary; however, like most legends, Lombardi's is more mythical than magical. Lombardi's flatlined from foodie fantasy to food fail thanks to pie-in-the-sky expectations flattened by cardboard crust, pricey pies, and sparse service. The Original Margherita Pizza with fresh Mozzarella, crushed Tomato Sauce, Romano, and fresh Basil is what started the pizza-lution 111 years ago. A large half Margherita and half Mushroom/Sausage was a must order for our pizza pilgrimage to Lombardi's ... and a total disappointment. A lot has changed in the world since 1905. America has made major advancements in medicine, communication, transportation, ... and pizza. Eating the Lombardi's disc of disappointment made me feel like I was stuck in one of those Direct TV Settlers commercials living in a world of castor oil cures, paper newspapers, horse-drawn buggies, and pitiful pizza.This is New York City for Christ's sake. Don't be like Jebediah. Don't settle for Lombardi's Pizza ... even if it is legendary, cause there's better New York-style pizza out there, son.

Ordered the classic Margherita pizza, which is what the chef's special is based off of (adds a few toppings like prosciutto and some greens for 10 more buck). Have to ask for Oregano and Parmesan cheese. Also gave me some basil on the side for now extra charge. :) Love the thin crust. Strong tomato flavor, was pleasant. Crust was nice and chewy. Would come back. Was still busy during Monday off hours but not too bad. Lovely, and love the brick interior. Preferred over Joe's pizza tho imo.",3/21/2018,389,71,9,CSQrwEnSqhyCQyO9ymOpTQ

I eat pizza probably once a month and so I wanted to come here.  I thought the pizza was a little overpriced and the pie we got was pretty good.  I thought it was better then a lot of joints in Los Angeles, but when in NY you have to try many other spots.  Would I come here again , maybe not but  I was glad I came here and took a picture of the first brick pizza oven.",6/12/2018,611,87,0,fsKUdlrKV4gFFkKgekaJlQ

Super tasty small pepperonis, little bit crunchy at the edges) and half with olives and garlic spinachs (smooth flavor of garlic which was perfect!)The crust of the pizza was splendid! I almost never eat the edges and this time I finished my slices.They do not accept cards, only cash (but there's an ATM)You should go at least once in your life if you happen to be in NYC!Why don't give 5 stars? because I think the price is a little bit high.

The crust is great, but at the end of the day, is this really that spectacular of a pizza to warrant the hype and the inflated prices?? Probably not. It's kind of amazing just how much the prices have gone up in the time since I was last here, and I realize now that there are a ton of other perfectly great pizza places around town. It was not crowded at all when we came, and service was very minimal. It's still cash only, which at this point, is kind of annoying.",2/14/2018,57,308,397,eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA

We ordered the margherita pizza with pepperoni. When it arrived, I was a little surprised to see so much of the tomato sauce showing through. Thinking back, we totally should have opted for extra cheese, as that was my only complaint about the pizza. Now on to the pizza: perfectly crisp and spicy pepperoni, sweet and tangy tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and the most delicious crust I've ever had! I'm usually not the biggest fan of pizza crust, but I think I could eat the plain pizza crust here. So perfectly seasoned, crispy but chewy... I wish I could eat more of that crust right now!

I ordered a small half white, half margherita pizza. The mozzarella cheese was so gooey and delicious. The ricotta on the white pizza was broiled and was perfection. The pizza had a really nice thin crunch to it. There is no argument that the pizza is quality. Now the cost can be a bit high. $25.55 for a small pizza, which is definitely on the high side.

I don't really like that because who carries cash now a days? Overall, the pizza was delicious and I completely understand why it was packed with people. The ingredients were fresh.

523,Jonah L.,0,5,"I'll never forget the night I first tried Lombardi's pizza. I was 16 years old, my first time in New York City, it was raining and it was dark, but my group and I made it a point to make it to Lombardi's the first pizzeria in America! The pizza that night is one memory I would never forget. Maybe it was because I was surrounded by friends, maybe it was because of the struggle to find this place, perhaps it was just the pizza itself that was so amazingly good, that I would always treasure that moment in my young life.Almost 20 years later, another trip to Lombardi's was not only nostalgic, but the experience was just as amazing as that first time!! If you visit New York City, you have to try a NY pizza and where else, none other than Lombardi's. We ordered the original margherita and the white pizza. Both tasted like nothing you'll ever experience. Clean, full of flavor, authentic and a staple taste of what a NY pizza is supposed to taste like. The interior just didn't change from 20 years ago and gives you an old-fashion brick house look and feel that matches with a coal-oven pizza restaurant.

Had no idea that for our first New York Pizza experience, we'd end up in the oldest pizza restaurant in the country! I've already had one New York-state native friend tell me ""real NY pizza has thicker edge crust than that,"" but hey, we totally enjoyed our Cake Boss. The $35 price tag was frankly shocking, but it was Yelper Daughter's turn to buy, so who was I to argue? To be sure, there was a TON of prosciutto on that pizza. When it comes to thin crust pizza, I like the Neopolitan style that has some chewiness to it, which this did (maybe that was my friend's criticism? Help me out, New Yorkers). We also got an order of bruschetta, which was absolutely perfect: just really fresh tomatoes, basil, and garlic on ciabatta bread. I also got a Brooklyn brew, another thing on my NYC checklist.One work of warning: it's cash only! The service was quick and friendly. The decor is textbook old Italian, with checkered vinyl tablecloths, old tile floors and lots of celebrity pix on the walls. And the 60s-70s music was like my elementary-school soundtrack.

Their history is great, their location good, and the write-ups are decent.I ordered a pepperoni pizza, the old timeless classic. My opinions: the crust was fantastic. Easily the best part. The cheese was very unevenly applied even given the margarita style of the pizza. I would have far preferred a plain-old cheese pizza covered in Buffalo Mozzarella, but they wouldn't do it. The tomato sauce, of which there was too much, was too acidic. The attached picture shows this pretty clearly. And, just to wrap up, the pepperonis were the tiny kind, where I prefer the larger slices. The Caesar salad was ok, and the dressing homemade.Overall, they seem to be getting by more on their reputation and history rather than their pizza. The price they charge for the pizza is 2x or 3x the normal price for a similar pie.",6/28/2017,25,30,22,Si_GoNyhNK3w5Ftj3rFG4Q

If you are ordering it the first time, I highly recommend their meatball and white pizza. You can also do 1/2 and 1/2 pizza if you cannot decide which one to get. I wouldn't recommend to come back because it's def overpriced for a simple pizza-you can add meat, but it's $3-5 per topping.Btw, it's cash only.

542,St p.,0,1,"Forget this place and go somewhere else. I hadn't been here in 10 years and was totally disappointed in what it has become. It is now a second rate tourist trap with overpriced and underwhelming food. Prices are ridiculous. 7 dollars for a plastic  cup of iced tea, 22 for a 12 inch margherita and 6 dollars for a small side of meatballs. Pizza looks nothing like pictures on wall and was mediocre. See pictures and judge for yourself. Sorry excuse for a pie at a place with such a history. Almost no basil and it was brown and wilting. Cheese was chewy and low quality. Sauce was tasteless. I'll never go back after knowing at least half a dozen places within several miles are better and cheaper. I'd rather see it close down than ruin NYC pizza's reputation more. Between this and the ""original"" NYC pizza places, most tourists must think everyone in NYC has terrible taste. Please fix your quality or sell off.",2/21/2019,1,48,6,LVi-4dH8caEE_vyiwj_HjA
543,Jenny D.,1,4,"This place is rated best on planet earth, maybe it's just me but it wasn't anything special or life changing. I fully expected to leave shocked and excited, but it was average. We had a wait time of 30 min, wait staff took our order, and gave us our food. Other than that, there was no interaction, no checking up on us, they kind of just leave you for your meal. Depending on what you like, I'm typically more for engagement and servers so consistently check up on you kinda girl. Pizza crust is nice and thin, cheese to sauce to topping ratio was pretty awesome, and they come out on these nice trays that leave great table space for plates and utensils/such. Slices are HUGE and prices are very fair so if you're looking for a cheap quality meal to fulfill the pizza craving, I'd totally recommend here. Only because I'm not a super huge pizza fan, it didn't really blow my mind. Overall, good place!",5/2/2017,1120,102,621,a8gE7Iu9BjXogu7jOs6WQw

I was in the city for a short period of time, so I tried to cross off what NY is known for. I didn't get to try much pizza. And also wish I didn't come here either! |Original Margherita| Small (6 slices) - $21.50 for dine in, $3 cheaper for take out. They don't sell by slices here so you'd have to get their small which feed up to two people at least. Dine in was too long for me that day so I ordered for to go and it's $3 cheaper by the way. Also, if you want topping it will cost $3-$5 in additional to the pizza price. We got the margherita with pepperoni & mushroom topping on half of the pizza.What a waste of my time! I do not see what people see in this place. The crust was not so thin how I'd imagine it to be and the dough was so salty. They put way too much tomato sauce on there.

Food: My friend and I split their thin crust margherita with prosciutto and YUM. Location/Service: The location is easy to find in little Italy and we were seated right when we got in the door. Our waitress told us that if we wanted to get a deep dish that we would have to order immediately since the oven was going to be cleaned - def. appreciated that. But since we were in NY we decided to keep it traditional. The pizza was delish and the topping was a nice touch. Nice and crispy at the bottom to hold up the ingredients well and each bite was filled with goodness. Very pleased.,6/19/2016,527,880,955,v9BuMJg_LxUPFbLnmY8dBA

They sat us right away. The pizza was delicious but a little pricey. The deliciousness made the price ok. lol it's little Italy so really it's what you should expect. There are two different rooms (maybe three). The back room is small and narrow. If you can request a seat in the main room but it seemed to have bigger group tables. They carry Coke! That's always a plus for me. Wish they had a few more app options. Cash only.,6/13/2017,65,308,271,-G6fkcQDewL4-5N01ZLYlg

At that point we didn't care because this place was rated so highly on Yelp. The pizza arrived covered  entirely of arugula -- to the point where there was hardly any cheese visible. The bitterness of the arugula was overpowering. I hardly tasted any of the prosciutto. It was not impressive... Just decent. On top of that service was cold. We got served and all, but we didn't feel welcomed. Um, is a thank you too much to ask? How about a you're welcome?! Don't just take our cash without saying a word. RUUUDE. Service plays a big part in making or breaking a restaurant, so somebody needs to attend to that stat!For those visiting for the first time, bring cash because it's CASH ONLY. All hype to me.

559,Willy M.,1,3,"One of the more historic older eateries in NYC, and it's pizza....so who wouldn't want to try them out.  I've seen them on the TV, heard about their popularity and their old school style of coal-fired pizza.  I love me some pizza and this was a must to come by during our stay in NYC.  We came mid-afternoon on a weekday so there wasn't much of a wait, maybe 10 minutes, it's a bigger restaurant than I thought as we cut through some rooms, cut through a part of the kitchen(which was pretty cool) and into a back room full of people and tables. Ambiance is great with old NY pizza joint feel, black & white photos of some of the history of the restaurant, some celebrity photos etc. We looked at the menu and we were mainly just focused on the pizza and with it being 14"" in size, we didn't want to over-order and carry leftovers around town.  We decided to get one of their specials: ""Buddy's Cake Boss Pizza""....you know, from the TV show Cake Boss? Not sure why it's called that but whatever. Didn't take too long for it to come out, pretty good size for 2 and it looked pretty tasty!  It had fresh mozz, red tomato sauce, prosciutto, and a huge mound of arugula on top with a light drizzle of olive oil.  Looked fantastic and it tasted pretty good.  Nice & crispy, thin but not falling apart, super hot, slight hint of smokiness(I'm guessing that's the coal) in the crust with a bit of chew, nice melty cheese that slightly stretched when you took a bite. Downside:there wasn't a whole lot of prosciutto meat on the pizza given the price.Service was great, they were super quick with drinks, refills, clearing, checking on you and getting your bill.  Definitely great customer service!  Pricing is a bit higher than I expected, our pizza was $35.....pizza is definitely not cheap food anymore. Didn't realize it, but this place is CASH ONLY!!!!!  Not sure why, I'm assuming they have high transaction fees or hate to do paper work?  Whatever the reasons may be, if all else fails, I saw an ATM inside.  Glad we stopped by to check it out on our visit so now we know.",1/8/2016,536,896,2077,iNIxjH-qoi0DW-0M2ML2DA

After having a few too many sweets throughout the day (let's just say that a Nutella crepe for breakfast and 3 bakeries later had me sugared out for 2016 in January), salad sounded like a perfect starter. I was badly was in need of something fresh and healthy, and the house salad was great. There's a bit of garlic in the vinaigrette which was pretty addictive, I enjoyed everything about it. Pizza wise the crust was my favorite part (I know, right.. what the hell).  It was airy and impossibly soft and chewy and crispy all at the same time with a bit of saltiness to boot. We ordered the white pizza with mozz, ricotta, garlic and basil. I wish there was more basil, on the ocassional basil-bite the basil made it pop.  Unfortunately it quickly all began to be a bit bland, however black pepper and olive oil came to the rescue.

The pizza was just OK nothing you couldn't get at any other brick oven place around the city. Not worth $31 at all.

We were excited to try New York's pizza since you always hear good things about it... but it was not worth to be honest.

I will admit that I appreciated the crispiness and how thin the pizza was. But just like any other Margherita pizza I've had it taste just like how its suppose to? The small pizza will feed about 2 people maybe 3 if you're not too hungry. I saw customers around me who ordered a whole pizza for themselves. If you are cool with spending more than $20 on some basic pizza then this place would be great. Also this place is Cash Only. They do have an atm nearby but you will be charged $3.Additionally, the waiters weren't really attentive. We sat there for awhile before they even asked for our order.

571,Andrew P.,1,2,Decent pizza but OVERPRICED! I was excited to try out a pizza place with more than 5000 Yelp reviews but left quite underwhelmed. The pizza was good but didn't really approach the levels of the other well known places like John's bear Times Square or even lesser known places close by. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and I was highly disappointed in the seemingly average quality of he pepperoni. Earlier in the day we ate pepperoni pizza at another place that was terrific so I was expecting at least as good pizza as that given the high number of 4-5 star reviews. To make things worse they serve you CHEAP PAPER PLATES instead of real plates!!! More annoyingly they try to sell you bottled water rather than start off by serving you the free water. All in all my impression is that this establishment is run by accountants who are trying to milk as much profit per customer as possible. This is NOT a winning formula.

We got ripped off zz Also, a fucking rude and big waiter hit my head with his elbow and did not even apologize. Maybe it was bc he was huge that he did not feel it but still LOL They also only accept cash (I think?). It felt like this place was trying really rip us off. The change we got lacked a few $, so we asked for a receipt to check. He did not give us an official receipt, cos he only writes the total down on a sheet of paper. So it took him another 5-10mins to have the receipt scanned (Are they trying to evade taxes? I hope not, for the price they charge for their lame pizza, they should have enough to pull out for taxes) :)) Upon checking the receipt, we saw that we lacked a few $, but we thought, it's fine, that can be our tip for their store.

582,Michelle L.,0,1,"After reading all about the history of this iconic place my pizza loving friend and I stopped by April 28th and had high hopes. Sadly, this was literally one of the worst pizzas I've ever been served. We ordered the Original Margherita Pizza and Personal Calzone - as my Italian friend was craving a good one and they are hard to find in CA. The pizza arrived quickly looking dry and old, it was obviously left under a warming light for way to long. The crust was charred and chewy but, that was the only redeeming quality. The sauce lacked any flavor whatsoever. The cheese looked and tasted like plastic. The barely warm calzone looked like it came pre-made from Sysco Foods and tasted worse. No flavor at all and it was not actually full of anything other than cheap, grey colored sausage. Where was the ricotta and warm chewy mozzarella? We took a few bites and asked for the check. The waiter notice that 95% of our food was uneaten and asked if we wanted a box. I explained that we really didn't like the food and he said nothing and walked away. He gave us the full bill, we paid it and went down the street to grab a slice at Joe's. This has become a place where tourists come to buy a t-shirt and nothing more. I actually enjoyed the old school vibe and our service was good. :-(",5/9/2018,23,144,41,tt-OD1ElD-Y81JcUt2lP7Q

584,Adrian M.,0,1,"What is the hype about? This is dollar a slice pizza priced exorbitantly high on paper plates with plastic cups.

585,Mike C.,0,4,"Great little pizza place on Spring Street in Little Italy, NYC.  Claims to be the first pizza place in the US, founded 1905.  Apparently very popular, we had about a 10 minute wait.  Staff was very friendly.  Try a Brooklyn Lager while you wait.  I had a classic pepperoni pizza.  The crust was fresh, the sauce was awesome.   Fresh basil and mozzarella highlighted the pie nicely.  Pizza places are plentiful here but this one is definitely worth a visit.",7/2/2017,253,119,152,U1lG8m7xMPmqeMf2q-UGLA
586,Eva C.,0,4,"Going to NY for the first time, several friends have suggested to try out the famous Lombardi's, so here I am giving a piece of my opinion after having a taste. :) First things first, my friend and I came a little late - after usual dinner hours; I suppose that's why there wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately upon our arrival. My friend and I decided on ordering a large pizza, (had to do it for the pic, heh) half original and half white. We jokingly asked the waiter if he thought we'd finish and he replied with something along the lines of ""OH, definitely not. You two girls, probably half!"" Our pizza arrived in a little less than 15 minutes and we were ready to chow down! I took my first bite, and honestly I wasn't quite impressed but it was GOOD. I liked how each slice of pizza was thin and crunchy. I'm glad we ordered a half and half though. The original pizza is a little sour but the white pizza is a bit too overwhelming with its cheesy flavor (especially if you've had three huge slices) so it's nice to mix and switch between flavors. I felt like the waiter was a little underestimating us hangry girls with a big appetite. Guess what? My friend and I ALMOST finished this GINORMOUS pizza with two slices to spare, although we had food babies soon after! ***BTW, CASH ONLY!!!",1/8/2017,245,66,83,21xCIJmlQXLCkdtV3Iq6ww

590,Corina R.,1,4,Old school pizzeria from 1905. They have expanded to businesses that used to be next-door. So there is quite a bit more seating then there was 15 or 20 years ago. They also offer takeout and delivery. You can get pizza basically anyway you want. Just ask. The Meatballs are fantastic.  Staff is very attentive but remember the place is always busy.

592,Brandon G.,1,2,"I really hate leaving poor reviews, but sometimes you just have to. I remember coming here a few years back (before my time on Yelp) and loving this place. This visit was just the opposite. We had a party of 10 and got seated rather quickly. Our server was friendly enough but once the order was taken and delivered, we never saw her again until it was time to pay. I know prices in this area are pretty steep, but we paid over $150 for three pizzas, a calzone and mostly ice waters? That sounds a bit high, especially since they don't accept credit cards and the server sat there and added everything up in her head before giving us our total.  That aside (and that's not my real gripe) the food itself was just not good at all. Most everything was way over cooked. My brother-in-law got a pepperoni and mushroom calzone and it arrived at our table pretty black and XX crispy. My $8 beer was the best part of my meal. I guess I was very bummed  about being let down this time. Between the price and the food quality, I really doubt I would come back again.",12/2/2016,272,228,733,PB80rkH2cd1384gR_TXv4A

In fact, there were several empty tables around (seems like week nights are the way to go.)We ordered a caesar salad to share (perfect sharing size) and a large half Margherita half white pizza with sausage. The large pizza is very, very large and could easily be shared between 3. The Margherita was delicious and definitely lived up to the hype. Since there was just a thin layer of sauce and mozzarella with thin crust, it also seemed to be a relatively healthy pizza as well. The half white was also delicious, but there was a lot a lot of ricotta which I found a little overwhelming.I will 100% be back for that caesar and Margherita!",12/2/2015,1089,148,815,NT5PIrm_5PMIvhKThayOIg

Yes, it's touristy but it's damn good authentic NYC coal oven pie. Thin, crisp, tasty crust, good sauce to crust ratio. A good pie. My fav go-to is the meatball pie. Now if you want something truly spectacular, and you LOVE clams go for the clam pie.. 3lbs of fresh clams, garlic, olive oil, parsley atop a perfect buttery thin crust... mmmm mmm mmmm! It's pricey though $35 for a 14"" pie..  It's worth doing at least once. Good eats ;-)Pssst! If you are seeking the CLAM PIE go early in the week... A little bird told me they get their clams delivered on Mondays and they usually run out well before the weekend.

597,Tiffany C.,0,5,"Came here recently during a trip to New York and was recommended this Pizza place by practically everyone I know whose been to NY. A couple things, be prepared to wait. But don't worry, the wait goes by really quickly and they do give you a buzzer so you don't have to count down the time in your head. The menu here is really small on purpose. Because all of the items offered here are probably the best you'll ever have. My friends and I ordered the Margherita which is probably the best red sauce I've ever had on any pizza in my life. The white pizza was also a hit with my group as it was a nice complement to the Margherita, super decadent but equally delicious. The star of the meal to me though was surprisingly the bruschetta, my god this was amazingly fresh and citrusy. Basically you can't go wrong with ordering anything here :DAlso, bring CASH as this is a cash only restaurant!",12/30/2016,205,72,150,TlxDzjL1ORRmsT--J3eZSQ
598,Lydier H.,0,2,"Regardless the rest of the world are trying to make pizza a part of the fast food cult. I honor this place for preserving its authentic services and outlook. The red plaid table cloth, narrow walkways, wine racks in the basement, alone the uneven edged pizza served with Aqua water..made this place a real Italian like restaurant. You won't regret for coming here celebrating one of those holidays with your family. However, The pizza has no flavor and the bread is very hard to chew on. But least I wasn't bothered by the thirst sensation like the way I had previously eating at Premia pizza place. Which means Lombardi didn't use unhealthy ingredients to trick the customers buying their pizza. I have to say If I were here trying my first NY style pizza. I think I'll lose the desire to eat it again. Because the taste to me was just so-so.Three-star to the tasteless pizza. Two-star for the price point that really didn't meet my expectation ($30 regular size, white pizza)",12/13/2016,373,213,552,epEeyQ_5S1WEAJL1CKB0BQ
599,Ingrid S.,1,3,"My wait personally wasn't that long for getting into Lombardi's. Which is shocking after reading reviews of how it usually takes forever. It was the middle of the afternoon on a hot summer day. My sister was visiting from out of town and wanted to try of course New York Pizza. I let her pick a place and this was what she choose since its world famous and allegedly the oldest pizza restaurant in New York, dating back to 1905. And then the next day I made her go to Spumoni. I digress. I think its worth trying out once or maybe even twice but its still not my favorite pizza place in the city and I do think its a tourist trap with heavily inflated prices. Tour groups even come through periodically for a brief history lesson and a slice. It happened while I waited a few minutes for a table. The place in itself is neat. You can tell the building has been around awhile. A bunch of celebrity photographs with restaurant owners and chefs over the years. Even dear ole Miley Cyrus graces the walls. Classic red and white checkered tables bizarrely decked with plastic cups. I guess it saves on the traffic flow with having disposable utensils. The food. We ordered the Grandma's Meatballs (Probably the best thing on the menu). Rich tomato sauce, outstanding meatballs. Though, its hard for me to hate on any meatball. The tomato and mozzarella salad - Kind of exactly what I would expect. Good. Everyone loves fresh mozz. The pizza - A large original with half of it covered in pepperoni. This pizza alone is well over $20. Classic Neapolitan style pizza with a crunchy crust. The sauce was the best part. The mozzarella was very good. But somehow I still left very underwhelmed. I thought to myself I'd rather have taken you to Toby's in Park Slope or even Joe's Pizza.

So clearly, this place is a tourist trap and I realized that the moment I walked into Lombardi's. There was nothing but tourists there and on top of that...CASH ONLY. There was nothing appealing about the pizza either. It looked bad, it tasted bad and they charge absurd amounts for a pie the size of a small from Dominoes. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous. Save your money and avoid this place. Prince Street Pizza isn't all that far from Lombardi's and I'm not Prince Street Pizza's biggest fan because I don't like their overwhelmingly thick crust but I'll take that over Lombardi's any day.",11/13/2017,195,7,0,ANulPR_cli_zvNHd2wh6jA

614,Grandpie A.,0,1,"Brutal rating for a brutally bad pizza.  Dry crust, lacking flavor, dense dry sauce, no flavor from the cheese.  I knew before I came here that it's a tourist trap, but with so much history and the old oven I hoped that the pizza would at least be ok to good.  It wasn't and it was bad.  Three grown men, one large pizza, none of us finished our first and only slice.Why one star? This is bad pizza compared to any pizza I've had anywhere.  The tomatoes were dry and dense, the crust was crap, the cheese only shows up in appearance but does nothing for flavor or chew.  I am a bit amazed that they stay busy from reputation, because I don't know any respectable foodie that would send their friends and family to eat what I was served.  It's entirely possible that I showed up on the day where all ingredients were off, but I eat lots of pizza and I rarely leave angry from the experience.  I really want to slap someones hand (head chef, proprietor) and say shame on you.  My pizza fanatic friends and I ate at over 20 NYC pizzerias over the course of 3 days. We were in 100% agreement that this was, by far, the worst pizza. My friend actually started asking other tables and wait staff where they were from because he was sure that no locals would eat here.  Sure enough, every person was from out of state.  Enough said.",11/28/2016,4,60,71,I7FvE1jTafKbS-mWy9GQqQ

617,Erik R.,0,3,"You have to respect Lombardi's for its history. It set what is now a trend in New York for pizza. That being said of my self guided pizza tour it sadly came in a solid last place. The pizza isn't bad by any means, but when compared to John's on Bleecker, Joe's, Prince street or di fara it just doesn't compare as well. If it were nearly anywhere but NYC it would at least get a 4 star from me. But given its competition it's down graded. The Mozzarella was lacking, leaving the sauce and crust as the main attraction. Sadly they don't live up to the spotlight. The crust was certainly more floury and chewey, and the sauce doesn't stand out as anything all that special.  It's worth it to see the birth place of the pizza joint, but if stressed for time I'd suggest another.",2/27/2018,0,18,19,ijbg4o7r_5j_G4ygluplMA
618,Adam B.,1,4,"After visting on my Little Italy tour the prior summer I got to actually sit in Lombardi's and try an entire pizza for myself. I was impressed with the drink selection. I drank a Yeungling, followed by a Brooklyn lager. I guess I was feeling pretty jolly.I had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for one. I ordered a 14 inch sausage and roasted pepper pizza. I admit I really wanted to try the white clam pizza. But for $35, that was absolutely not going to happen. Never mind that I wanted to add bacon to it, which would have cost another $4. There is simply nothing like that taste of a pizza that has been bakes inside of a coal-fired oven. It has that earthy, smoky flavor that one cannot replicate in a brick or stone oven. I said in my previous review that I was confident that I could wipe out an entire pie by myself. And I did exactly that. The crust was both crisp and chewy, just as I like it. The sauce was flavorful and the peppers added a nice contrast to the fennel and spice of the Italian sausage. The service was prompt and friendly. I also love that they play Sinatra over the speakers; it adds such an authentic ambience. The one negative would have to be the prices. Two beers and a pizza cost me over $50.

We ordered the white pizza since we don't have that in Vancouver as well as some meatballs for an appetizer and a house salad. For 3 people, this was way too much food. Not only was the pizza crust thin and crispy, the toppings were plentiful (although it was just stacked with cheese - mozzarella AND ricotta). After one slice, I was done and it did taste good, but too heavy for my liking. The Grandma's meatballs on the other hand were great! Again a bit fatty but very flavourful and juicy!

620,Caitlin C.,1,3,"Having been on my ""to-try"" list for a LONG time, I wanted to like this place way more than I actually did, once finally paying a dinner visit with some out-of-town family.  First of all, for its age I expected it to feel way more old and homey inside.  It didn't feel like the history was visible anywhere throughout (you actually get far more atmosphere at Arturo's on Houston).  And especially don't let them seat you in the drab basement.  It's worth being in the more lively upstairs, event if you have to wait. The classic margherita pizza is undeniably tasty.  But be wary if anyone in your party isn't keen on the fresh mozzarella approach to pizza.  It's all they offer - no shredded cheese here. We also got breadsticks and marinara which hit the spot for staving off hunger, but weren't particularly flavorful.  All of this said, the Lombardi's team is beyond friendly and works their hardest to ensure a pleasant dining experience for all involved.  We even had someone chase us down out front to remind us about inadvertently forgotten leftovers, which was much appreciated.",11/14/2015,450,520,11035,B0KxQBYWIZdb5iw19sRxDw
621,Daniel B.,1,4,"Lombardi's Pizza is America's first pizzeria. It opened in Manhattan in 1905 and is still in business today! Fortuitously, we booked an apartment on Airbnb which happened to be right across the street from this restaurant. One of our hosts recommended Lombardi's and said they were the first to come up with the concept of the pizza slice. They started out selling pizzas whole, but when people couldn't afford them, they ""invented"" pizza by the slice.Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical heading into this place given the hype. However, I'm really happy we decided to check it out, not only for its historical significance, but also because the food we had here was really good. This place is old school New York Italian in every way. Today, it's technically located in Nolita (North of Little Italy), but back in the day, Nolita was a part of Little Italy.This cozy neighborhood restaurant sits on the ground level of a five-story red brick building at the corner of Spring and Mott. You can't miss its dark red awnings and Mona Lisa mural outside. We visited for a Friday night dinner around 9pm. While the place was busy, our party of two was seated immediately. The place isn't very big. There are two levels of seating: ground level and downstairs in the wine cellar.The upstairs dining room has more color, decor, and activity compared to the downstairs dining room. The semi-open kitchen, bar, and entrance are upstairs. Anyone who dines downstairs must walk through the upstairs dining room (hence more activity upstairs). The downstairs dining room is more intimate and peaceful. Racks of wine line two of the walls. Restrooms are located down here as well (I'm not sure if there is another set of restrooms upstairs). It's loud upstairs. Downstairs, it's more quiet. Tables are positioned closely together and you can easily hear the conversations of those sitting around you.Though the atmosphere at Lombardi's is casual, this is *not* a pizza joint where you can just hop in and hop out with a street slice. This is a sit-down restaurant. Also, it's cash only. If you forget to bring cash, they've got an ATM inside.Lombardi's keeps its menu simple with $9-11 appetizers like salads, bread sticks, bruschetta, meatballs, and Italian sausage. Pizzas include the original Margherita and a white pizza (these run about $22-28 each depending on size); and their famous specialty clam pie and ""Cake Boss"" pizza ($35 each). The clam pie is made with about three dozen chopped clams. The Cake Boss is basically the Margherita with prosciutto and arugula. The latter two pizzas only come in one size (14 inches, six slices) while the others can be ordered in a larger size (18 inches, 8 slices) as well. All are popular.In addition, there are over a dozen toppings you can add to any pizza for $3-6 per topping per pizza. These include various meats, cheeses, and vegetables. Finally, they offer a $15 personal calzone made with ricotta and fresh mozzarella which I'm willing to bet is delicious.We ended up going with a house salad ($9) made with organic mixed greens, white mushrooms, red onions, tomatoes, and a house vinaigrette; and a 14-inch original Margherita ($21.50) made with fresh mozzarella and fresh crushed tomato sauce topped with Romano cheese and basil.The house salad was served in a wooden bowl with a set of tongs. The salad is big enough for two people. I like green salads and thought this one was tasty. The dressing was probably the best part. Everything was fresh and the onion slices, mushroom slices, and whole grape tomatoes were plentiful.The Margherita was terrific. The crust was charred black, crispy, and appetizingly (and slightly) bitter on the outside yet soft and addictively chewy on the inside. The pizza has a thin crust and is baked in a smoky coal oven. The savory light tomato sauce and the luscious globs of mozzarella were exactly what I expected of a nicely executed Margherita. This place has been making this pizza for decades and it shows. Originally, I had planned for us to take a couple slices home to eat as leftovers, but the pizza was so good that I ended up finishing off the last two slices myself.That said, I think the pizza we had was definitely more of an authentic Neapolitan-style pizza rather than a typical ""New York-style"" pizza from any old joint in Manhattan. For example, a pizza with more ""Americanized"" toppings like pepperoni and sausage. I'm no expert, but I believe this is the type of pizza from which the New York style was born.Service was fine. The business is a well-oiled machine that pumps out pizzas fast and turns around tables quick. These folks know what they are doing.In the end, I recommend Lombardi's. If you're a pizza lover, you owe it to yourself to go and experience where it all began.",10/20/2015,3424,3424,58947,j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg

Our waiter was a sweetheart (I left him extra tip just because of his sunny disposition, which is rare in NY).We ordered the meatball pizza - I usually don't like meatballs on my pizza, but the meatballs were flavorful and delicious. Pizza was great as expected, good sauce, good crust, all the makings of a successful pizza. Did it blow me out of the water like Grimaldi's or Patsy's - probably not, but you should still try it once. Most important thing you need to know - they take cash only and a pizza will run you $30+ (not including tax, tip, drinks), so come prepared.",10/21/2015,998,927,774,FokgHC5GuMddOY-E5Qco9g

Not for me, but it is pretty good.We were served pretty quickly and ordered a grapefruit spritzer which was refreshing and not too sweet.  Could do without the maraschino cherry.  Ordered the pizza with pepperoni and mushroom.  It came out fairly quickly.  The ingredients were fresh and i like the thin pizza and coal fired pizza.  Love the burned crispy flavor.  The one downfall is the sauce.  It is watery and has no flavor.  For me it is the sauce that makes it and not the cheese.  If you're  looking for spice definitely add the red pepper flakes at the table.  Without spice and flavor, its a cheesy mess.  It would have made a 4 if not for the flavorless watery sauce.  Bottom line, if not a big wait, worth a try.  But if you have to wait over 15 minutes, go to Fiat Cafe down the block for great italian food.",7/20/2018,111,180,176,eV3ua9EgRrdX-OFlP8Bdzw

We get to our new seats in the basement and we're greeted by a waiter with a really nasty open sore on his hand, serving us food. Gross...We get a large pie with four toppings. Of course the crust is too thin to contain all those toppings (how were we supposed to know this- seems like someone should've said something) so it was a soggy mess. Would've helped if they also would've cooked it a bit longer...On the plus side, the toppings were really good, and the cheese and crust were well done. Too bad the execution was crap.

649,Landy E.,0,3,"Surprisingly, I was not extremely impressed with Lombardi's. I think it has the acclaim as the first pizzeria in the US. That being said, it's in the heart of Little Italy/ Soho, so it's a huge tourist spot, which could only mean two things - 1) it's going to be expensive, and 2) there's a line. When I went, they were both true, although the line was only 10 minutes, which was pretty good.It's a massive restaurant, and we were seated in the basement. Not exactly my favorite spot to sit compared to the rest of the restaurant that looked really nice. Oh well. The only issue about sitting down there was that the waiters weren't there to tend to you, but still felt a bit rushed. Even though it took a while before they took our order, and gave us our check, which, by the way, is CASH ONLY for all you millennials and credit card points seekers out there *me cough cough*. Anyway, their signature clam pizza ran us over $30. While I'm glad to say that I tried it there, I've definitely had better.I'm gonna go with three stars for Lombardis in terms of my experience that night, but I'm optimistic that it's still a great establishment.",1/28/2014Previous review,306,142,269,YNd6Ycs8DBhMEjsA9IRQYg

I felt like for ordering a $30 pizza there should be more to the experience. The environment is similar to a picnic. Probably will try another pizza place next time.,7/29/2018,81,8,3,5QuhPEYFmLAe_l4FUPGPPQ
670,Dan H.,1,5,"So I am sitting in front of Murrays Bagels in Greenwich Village minding my own business enjoying my breakfast bagel when my cell vibrates. It is Yelp Bud Dave G checking in to see how the trip is going and if I had hit up Lombardi's yet. I text back that it is my last full day and the Brooklyn cousins were meeting me in a couple of hours at Katz's Deli, and Lombardi's would have to wait for my next trip. Dave was not about to let me off the hook on this one. He pretty much gave me two options, do one for lunch and the other for dinner or scrap Katz's. Doing both was not going to work out, so me being more of a pizza fan than pastrami we opted for Lombardi's. So glad that we remade our plans.Yes, here I am being all Switzerland again and doling out 5 stars for both Lombardi's and Di Fara's in Brooklyn. But Lombardi's earns their 5 stars for some different reasons. Yes, the crust is perfect. Yes, the ingredients are super fresh. And Dave's suggestion to get roasted red peppers as a topping really kicked the pie to a whole 'nuther level. Not one complaint about this edible masterpiece. However, my Brooklyn cousins did rate Lombardi's slightly ahead of Di Fara's, as they thought the char at Di Fara's was a bit excessive. Being lifelong Brooklynites does give them some serious credibility, I will have to admit. But unlike Di Fara's where there is zero ambience and spartan service, Lombardi's really outshines any other pizza place I have ever been to regarding the aforementioned, especially the caring efficient service. From the time you walk in and are immediately greeted by the fulltime hostess, and her trusty sidekick the service never faltered. I arrived ahead of the cuzzez and repaired to the small bar where the bartender was very accommodating in answering my questions about the history of the place, and other annoying questions that I flung his way. The other patrons were as excited as I and we all chatted up each other. I arrived around 1:00 to a line of course. But with this well oiled machine in top form my buzzer went off in less than 15 minutes. Since my cuzzez had not yet arrived the bartender suggested that I consult with the hostess. I know from past experience missing that first call causes the patron to be relegated to the bottom of the list. Not here. My cuzzez arrived about 10 minutes later, and we were immediately whisked off to our table in one of the 5 small dining rooms. Our whiskerer was very friendly and said our waitress would be with us shortly. Yeah, like in 1 minute shortly. She was sweet and fun, and really helped to get us in a jovial mood to get my second pizza of the week checked off my list.Thanks Dave G for your divine intervention, and now Katz's' will be the one that will have to wait until my next NYC visit.",8/27/2015,419,884,193,qSPFhtM-eO842BVQXtAMNg

673,Gurkiran G.,0,2,For the hype I really expected a lot better pizza especially after waiting and hour and a half in a very on organized way. The ingredients were definitely fresh and by the time we got to our table we did get our pizza pretty fast but for $40 I think you can get the same kind and much more flavorful pizza elsewhere.

674,Regine D.,1,4,"My friend took me here because when you go to New York, you have to get thin slice pizza. We were seated right away and it was pretty packed. I was sad when they didn't have Hawaiian pizza (my favorite) on their menu. We ordered pepperoni and sausage instead, which was still pretty great. It was amazingly good as I imagined it would be. They were generous with the toppings. The cheese was so ooey gooey good. I would definitely want to come back. The service was great. They were refilling my water cup pretty often.

We ordered the meatballs for a starter. The sauce was amazing but my only concern was when we got the dish it was almost cold!!!! Seriously? I wanted to say something but I was not in the mood to complain. It kind of made me grossed out like I don't know how long it's been sitting on a counter. For the pizza, it was pretty good but maybe I just have to try one of their other pizzas next time I visit.",8/26/2015,451,182,441,5OllWsrKJsYo3XQK6siRKA

The interior has a papa-johns looking guy with a ""fresh"" pizza pasted on the wall and the rest of the interior is extremely touristy and generic. I would not recommend going here. The prices are way too high for the level of quality you are getting in the food. We got the Lombarid's ""Special"" which was essentially cardboard with sauce, cheese, raw meat, and raw spinach.

677,James M.,0,5,It's been a while since I stopped in since there's so many pizza options these days . The thing I love about places like this is they are not trying to be trendy and hip . This is old school New York . They don't care who you are they treat  everyone with same level of service .  Cons - expect to wait an hour at peak times .  Simple wine  list needs more options and varieties .  While waiting So hang out at the spring bar  down the street .  Pros - gr8 pizza ( don't order more than 2 toppings ) I like just one for its pizza .  One pizza does 3 people . Tomato mozz salad is good app for group . Don't over eat on bread b4 pizza !!,10/14/2017Updated review,11,58,20,N4a0hQn67ydTxZ-qeEuoZQ
678,Mary T.,1,4,"I love pizza in New York.  This place is a NYC institution as it has been around since 1905.  They usually always have a wait unless you go in the slower hours. My recommendation would be to have a late lunch here.I love love love the bruschetta! They give u so many tomatoes, which is not the norm most places.  I also love the Margherita Pizza.  This is definitely somewhere you must try, even if it's only once, just to say you've tried it out. It's CASH ONLY, but they do have an ATM inside.  They also don't offer free refills so drink those sodas slow!If your in the area then go get some pizza and bruschetta, if not you can always get a delivery from them.Cheers & Enjoy!",4/19/2011Previous review,1315,475,7026,0b3FXt-EgiwMvS4scwBKeA

Classic NYC style pizza is all that comes out of the first ever pizza place in the US. Moving down the block from the original spot only because the ""newly installed train"" had destroyed the oven. Great taste to the charcoal burning, brick oven cooked, rustic pizza.Pizza as rustic as the restaurant and inhabitants",10/18/2015,460,907,3995,sBgR7lRY09Ddmv2I7e9hqA
688,Ryan M.,0,5,"A great traditional slice! Can never go wrong with a meatball pie from Lombardi's, one of NY founding pizzerias. My cousin often goes and buys me a box when I come up to visit but only 1-2 because of how expensive they are (30$ a pie average).

689,Laura R.,1,4,"I am really interested in history, and historical landmarks, buildings, firsts, etc, and also... PIZZA. That ish is the bomb. So when I heard about Lombardi's, it was a definite given I would end up visiting it at some point.We took the Subway here, and it was really crowded, which was to be expected. Despite that, we sat down pretty quickly, and ordered. Usually, I like to write elaborate, well-written accounts of my experiences, but honestly, Daniel B. hit the nail on the head in every respect. So in lieu of being repetitive, I will simply leave this review with these final thoughts: the pizza here is good. Fresh flavors, crispy crust, and overall a good pie. And as far as being satisfying? Not so much. I'm the kind of person that eats half a hamburger and is full, or sometimes a max of two pieces of pizza. I was not full after eating half of an entire pizza here. Despite that, it's an institution, and worth a visit, just to say you went to the first pizzeria in the US.

691,Phillip B.,1,4,I enjoyed their crisp pizza crust and outstanding sauce on their pizza. We got a small margherita pizza. It was very good. The staff was fantastic. They were attentive and allowed us to take a photo of their coal fired oven. They allowed us to pose in front of their oven too. It is something you have to experience. One of those Foodie bucket list checkoffs when you come into NYC to visit. If you live in the Tri-state area and you haven't been here yet...shame on you. Cancel your foodie badge.

693,Ellen K.,1,5,"Absolutely a must go in NYC! But when you go, there will probably be a huge line outside the door because there is limited seating. For us, we found an easier, faster option to still try Lombardi's without the hour wait. Just order a whole pizza to-go on the phone and eat it with friends by the seats on the sidewalks. (Don't worry, you will see other people eating pizza on the streets, too.) It took 2 minutes to order and we picked it up 10-15 minutes later! It was so quick! And you get the same great taste the real authentic new york way (on the go). OH! MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH!!!! THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH!",1/2/2017,430,52,123,Po4UMQcWQGSjPKPliqToFw
694,Tina X.,1,2,"Not a fan don't get the hype. The pizza is very NYC pizza...not neopolitan, as they advertise, which is really annoying because it's falls so short of expectations. I mean it's the equivalent of some plastic surgeon selling you on a facelift but then just giving you a chemical peel. Not the same thing. The pizza dough wasn't airy at all and didn't rise properly like neopolitan pizza. The middle was soggy and limp. They may have some coal oven but they don't use it properly. The cash only policy is also pretty annoying and obviously used to avoid the irs. The prices of the pizzas are quite high. 27 for the smaller white pizza with one topping and 21 for the smaller cheese pizza. Im assuming the dough was laced with crack for it to be so pricey...They'd need to give me a pretty good coupon for me to come back...even with the side of crackRibaltas on 12th street is a much closer version of neopolitan pizza and at less cost.  The service was ok if you enjoy eating on paper plates and plastic cups like you are homeless. I think the Dunkin donuts barista down the street was more attentive from where she was standing and less gruff....but then again...like everyone else, I enjoy being served by a bear.

We ordered a large margarita pepperoni pizza, personal calzone with sausage, pepperoni, drinks sangria, beer, soda. Everything was delicious omg I highly recommend this place. Everyone that works here is friendly! Even the guys in the back are as well. I don't remember my servers name because two guys were helping us out. But he gave my son an Italian soda on the house. This place only takes cash which wasn't a problem for us but they have a atm inside if you don't have any on you.

We got the original margherita and added the beef and pork meatballs and the wild mushrooms. It was super delicious! We also got a carafe of their sangria and it was pretty tasty as well!

697,Jennifer N.,0,5,"I'm not even a pizza fan and I love this place so much.  Their pizza is the brick oven, old-world real deal.  Legit mafia new york style.AND--Make sure you get the house salad with their homemade dressing and buy a mason jar of the dressing to take home with you--you have to specially ask for this and I think it's like $8 but totally worth every penny and will last for weeks.  I also think I've finally mastered the ingredients, but there are still a couple I'm missing and it never comes out quite the same as when I buy it there, so I get it whenever we are in New York visiting.My boyfriend practically had to drag me in here since I really am not a pizza fan, but this is pizza for non-pizza-lovers.  Great sauce, light doe, and quality ingredients.The service is minimal but friendly enough.I love the atmosphere:  no frills but old world and comfort.  The true new york pizza experience and you can walk around all the great shops in soho afterwards:)",2/5/2017,224,89,159,81E27lL25iFXinm-fLRo3A

I was very disappointed when I saw the disposable plates were you're serve and haven't seen the pizza or the menu yet. The menu consist of only 4-5 pizzas to choose from but remember it dates back from the 20's. Still I expected a good pizza but I was wrong. It lack flavor and it was really toasted . The tomato sauce wasn't very consistent to say the most. On the other side The place and the ambience are pretty nice and comfortable . Pretty place to eat but overrated and pricey!

Our food was also servered off of paper plates. However, these are not the main problem I have with this restaurant, the issue is the food and it's related pricing. The pizza was quite flavorless and bland, it did not live up to the expectation of 4/5 stars. The tomato sauce consisted of too much liquid making the crust wet.

I found myself saying in my head ""This better be amazing for a twenty one dollar tiny pizza.But it wasn't amazing. The dough was a bit chewy. It actually had excellent flavor but the texture didn't feel right and it wasn't as thin as I would've expected. The sauce tasted fairly good, I love the classic taste of San Marzano tomatoes.

709,Sam K.,1,3,"What a piece of history this is! I've heard that this is New York's first pizzeria. As we walked in I noticed that the tiles above the coal oven spell out '1905.' One of the reasons I love New York food is that it is so rich with heritage, tradition, and culture. The history within the walls was almost tangible as we made our way to our table.On the other side the waitress was absolutely terrible. I'm sorry, but she sucked. She was completely inattentive, barely even stopping at our table. It took about 30 minutes to place our order for one large Margherita pie. She didn't refill our drinks once. And never asked us if we needed anything. I literally had to flag her down to get her to come to our table every time. I even had to get up and go look for pepper, garlic, etc. because we didn't have any at our table and the waitress was no where to be found.Now normally, that quality of service alone would be enough for me to give a one star review, straight up! However, the pizza was perfect. The crust was so crispy and flavorful. I could taste all of the seasonings. The sauce was amazing.Amazing pizza. Incredible history.

710,Mendy Y.,1,4,"The pizza here was very different from what I expected, but I liked it. Ordered a small original margarita with mushrooms. The entire pizza from the tomatoes to mozzarella (and I don't even like mozzarella normally) to dough just tasted so fresh. It wasn't as seasoned as I thought but I unexpectedly liked the lighter taste. I also really liked the crust, which was a little puffier than the rest of the pizza. The small was a perfect size for 2 people. The restaurant is actually really big: while it appears to only have one main room plus a bar when you first walk in, there are actually more spaces in the back. We came here on a Friday night around 8:30 pm and only waited for about 5 minutes. The place is unpretentious and has a very homey, Italian vibe.

The glass of wine I had wasn't bad. Paper plates and plastic cups, could it get any worse?I gave it an extra star only because they seated us right away.If you want really good pizza go around the corner to a place that starts with an R and ends with an A(check my reviews).

715,Parenty L.,0,2,"Ambience: 3/5Cost: 2.5/5Food: 2.5/5Service: 3/5I think this place is over-hyped. The pizza was quite average from the sauce to the toppings to the crust. Wish I had the option of picking up a slice instead of the entire pie. Also, it's on the pricier side (came out to $20 without even any additional toppings) and the service can definitely be improved. Perhaps it's the new yorker way, but I felt they were a little cold and could be more welcoming.",8/5/2016,13,60,86,AedJ9prHZvr3wBJ_eTsd8g

719,Fefe P.,0,2,"Ok, so let me start off by saying that New York pizza can be a very personal obsession for some. Admittedly, I am one of those people. Of course I am cognizant of the fact that Lombardi's kicked the entire Pizza revolution off in America and I am eternally grateful and respectful of that tradition. Also, some say this is authentic pizza similar to what one would find in Italy--I don't doubt it. Plus, many born and bred New Yorkers swear by Lombardi's. That being said, Coal Oven is just not my favorite type of New York style pizza and what I grew up on and subsequently LOVE (and have to eat whenever I'm back in the city). Perhaps Lombardi's is worth trying at least once to make your own determination--it is a legendary place after all! Now, my brother is the one who had a craving for Lombardi's today, so I found myself there on the 4th of July, otherwise I would not have been. The restaurant is nice and spacious, and was  crowded with apparent satisfied customers. Maybe I'm just not cool and cultured enough with my pizza palette to love Lombardi's, I don't even like it. I prefer a crispy crust (that can be folded), simple flavorful cheese (perfectly proportioned, not greasy or falling off the slice) and slightly sweet, delicious sauce. Also, ""sold by the slice"" is my type of place, ideally. Unfortunately, nearly the opposite of Lombardi's.We ordered the White Pizza. Sadly, it just did not have enough flavor for me and the dough was way to soft for my liking. While the ingredients tasted fresh, I just couldn't get past one slice and was only able to finish it by dipping in sauce. Just completely underwhelming, sigh! Drinks were expensive, no refills and I just don't think the overall prices are justified--this place is pricey and Cash Only! $43 for a large pizza and 3 sodas??? On the positive side, my brother really enjoyed the White Pizza and prefers this style of pizza in general. Well, as they say...to each his own LOL! Personally, I will be going up the street for my perfect slice :-). Happy Eating!",7/4/2016,148,132,770,3HYqGc68c61i0_bYXG8xDQ

I work in the restaurant industry so I know the Inconvenience it can be to have customers walk around your work space ..

726,Stacey B.,0,1,"We live in Connecticut and have been coming to NYC since we were children. We took our 6 year old to the city to see the Christmas Tree and based upon hype and reviews, we went to Lombardi's. The wait was quite long which made us believe we were about to have a taste of greatness. The atmosphere was lacking, but who cares- I can overlook any atmosphere if the food is unbelievable. We ordered the Margherita pizza. For a large pie, it was rather small. It was thin, luke warm and had only 5 circles of mozzarella cheese. The crust was blackened which gave it a burnt toast type of taste. We ate the whole pie, not out of delight but because we waited so long and were very hungry. I kept looking around to see if the other diners were having the same looks of disappointment but it was hard to tell. I think this is just a tourist trap that is in no way worthy of being called NY Pizza. It is just a bragging right to friends that have never had the misfortune of dining here. Sad that we were had.

I took my child there last week because he was into trying all the classic pizza spots...Di Fara, Grimaldi's, Totonno's, and Lombardi's for some reason i guess is still part of that list.

Not over salted, not full of other things, the simple beauty of tomatoes coming through. Crust, thin. My personal favorite. I'm not a fan of thick crust.

Woohoo!We ordered a large half white/half margherita pie, with mushrooms. This grand pie was served to us in about 15 minutes.So the pizza is definitely solid, but not as great as I remembered. We both agreed that the tomato sauce on the margherita was too runny. Though the sauce was good, it was just sliding off with each bite--plate, fingers, lap--taking all the other ingredients with it. Too messy. The white pizza was friggin' awesome though.  There was so much going on but it tasted so fresh and clean. I loved the abundant spread of ricotta and the stringy mozz. Expensive, yes.

They charge $24 for a large pie, which is equivalent to a large individual pie with 8 small slices. and to top it all, they only accept cash and use paper plates and utensils which is a joke considering what they charge for a pie.  The service was good so that is why this gets 2 stars.

740,Joy G.,1,4,"This review is very hard to write, as I am currently finding it hard to breathe after shoving down three slices of cheese and dough. We went on the earlier side of 5 pm so some of the tables were still empty. Skipped the famous meatballs because stopped at two ice cream places beforehand (in our defense, it was really hot and it's scientifically impossible to walk through East Village without stopping at Momofuku milk bar in the summer for some cereal soft serve). Meatballs were kind of a let down with not enough herbs or seasoning. The pancetta was also kind of rubbery and under-cooked. But NONE OF THAT MATTERS! I think I liked the margherita half more than the white, even though I couldn't get enough of the generous lumps of ricotta cheese on the white. ""Let's bring the last two slices back home,"" I suggested at one point. Nope. We finished the whole pie. Per usual. Be forewarned that there may be shrieking babies and slightly abrupt waiters and people who eat most of their pie and then tell the waiter that the sauce was way too salty. Eek. Bring cash, lots of it. Our half and half pizza with spinach, meatballs, and pancetta came out to $45 including tip. Dammit, New York.",5/25/2015,1220,835,182,BAXqpS21alyoX4-Z5611Hg

744,Laura W.,1,4,"My friend, Sabrina Q., insisted that Bryan W. and I visit Lombardi's Pizza while in NYC since it was the first pizzeria in the USA, founded in 1905. Four of us stopped in around 3:00pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately at a booth in the back room. Lots of pictures of celebrities visiting Lombardi's adorn the walls, and I will say I liked the exposed brick. Ambiance and atmosphere, as predicted, is very casual. So casual, in fact, that you eat off paper plates, which do to the high volume of business, I suppose makes sense. Prices are high, even by NYC standards, and it's cash only, although there is an ATM onsite if needed. Drink options are pretty minimal-standard soda options, a few wine choices, and a few beers. Bryan W. and I opted for wine, and at $8/glass, I was decently satisfied with the semi-generous pour. One of our dining mates ordered a Stella, pricy even by NYC standards at $8. The four of us decided to split a large pizza-half with meatballs and pepperoni and the other half with pancetta and ricotta. Was this the best pizza I've ever had? No, but it was quite satisfying nonetheless and it did really hit the spot after a long day at the 9/11 museum. I can only speak for the half Bryan W. and I chose, the pancetta and ricotta,-the pancetta was crisp, the ricotta was creamy and balanced out the saltiness of the pancetta, and the fresh basil was a nice addition. Both the pancetta and ricotta were distributed evenly and in abundance on our half of the pie. The sauce on the pizza was quite light; I would have preferred a slightly greater amount. The coal fired crust was perfect-crisp without being burnt. The other half of the pizza was quickly eaten, and both diners said it was delicious.My biggest qualm regarding Lombardi's is the price. When all was said and done, the aforementioned pizza was a $40 pie. 8 slices=$5 slice=not worth it. The pizza was tasty, yes, but frankly, I don't believe it was worth its cost. Another small irritation was that the checks are handwritten and there were no descriptions on what cost how much. We figured out she divided it into drinks and then the pizza, but when we were trying to split the pizza cost by what we ordered, not exactly in half (some of the toppings were more expensive than others), it proved difficult because nothing was itemized.I would definitely recommend visiting Lombardi's once to have the experience of dining in the first pizzeria, however, I'd say after that first experience, you should venture up to Brooklyn where there are a ton of great pizzerias where a pie doesn't cost $40.",7/6/2016,318,1509,2579,gFsqraWQfG46ohVFRg_d3A

We got there a little before the dinner rush and were seated immediately. We ended up ordering a half margherita with Italian sausage and half white pie with roasted garlic spinach. The pizza wasn't bad but to say that's the best pizza ever? That's a no. I have more of an affinity for red sauce so I did prefer the margherita but... (And I hope native New Yorkers don't hunt me down for this) it would have been a better pizza if I could dip it in ranch. The white pizza was good. The spinach was the best topping for it but there was some element missing that I couldn't put my finger on. The crust was also slightly lacking. The service was good.

Whenever I order the large for two people, we end up eating it all and being too full after so I think the small is perfect, it's not even small, they should just call it regular size lol. I loved the patches of mozzarella, I wish they did cheese like this in LA, where I'm from. My BF also mentioned how perfectly crisp the crust was. There were plentiful toppings and the pepperoni was so tasty and crispy. We finished the pizza so quickly, I had to slow down to savor each bite. Service was great! We were at a little table and a booth opened up, and they let me move over. Our pizza was taking a little longer than the people around us, not sure why...but they sent over some complimentary breadsticks and the marinara sauce was delicious.

And given how most folks had to wait hours, my family and I got seated right away (most likely because the Feast of San Gennaro was going on). Still a full restaurant with heavy rotation. We went classic margherita and even the large feels sort of small. Maybe this is a one and done type of thing for me -- don't really feel compelled to go back. I don't regret laying down the cash (only) and the fam definitely enjoyed the pizza, but I would have equally enjoyed a slice or a pie from Joe's or John's. That feels like the NY slice I was really hungry for.",9/26/2017,40,90,33,btw7MwfVyrBFTu9VizBOlw

764,Ashley S.,0,3,"When in New York, pizza is a must, right?! Lombardi seemed to pop up a lot, so obviously it was on my to-eat list. From the reviews I read on Yelp, it seemed like a half margherita half white pizza was going to be the thing to try. When they brought out the paper plates, I thought to myself, 'ok, this is just part of the experience- the pizza is going to blow me away anyways, and the plates won't matter'. The pizza came out on a raised pizza tray. First bite into the white pizza.....it was ok, maybe not my thing. Into the margherita....still not blown away. The pizza was extremely thin, with barely any toppings. Lets just say there's a bit too much hype for Lombardi's (IMO).

I was immediately offput by the fact that they gave us plastic cups and paper plates considering this was a decently priced sit down restaurant. We ended up splitting a large original margherita with pepperoni. Maybe this just isn't my type of pizza but there was nothing memorable about it. I could tell it had some good qualities, but it just didn't stick out to me. It seems most of the appeal for this place stems from the fact that they are the ""first"" pizzeria.

It's located by Little Italy so the area around the restaurant is cool to walk around in after eating. One important thing to remember is CASH ONLY. I had to go to the market across the street to the ATM. I definitely wanted to try pizza from the first pizzeria in the US. It's a good size and the Italian soda was very good as well! The food didn't take a lot of time to come out surprisingly for it being as busy as it was. If you're in New York City, this pizzeria is a must.",10/4/2017,48,28,96,-7y7gw3AM5tjaFTmbaoXLw

First, the pizza is completely overpriced. $35 for a large two topping pizza - are you nuts? $10 more and I can get a steak at Mastro's. Regardless, I dont mind paying for good food, so whatevs, ordered it with the fam. Now, the best way to describe the pizza is ""wet"". It wasnt greasy (LOVE greasy pizza) but almost like a water base on top. You find alot of Neapolitan pizzas are like this but this is based on a coal oven. I didnt think it was very good but my party enjoyed it. Crust was good!Go down the street to the other famous pizza spot for the best pizza in the city or hit up grimaldis - way better",7/4/2017,108,112,4,v3O6ka--Gus4FfJvk4tgeg
770,Vincent T.,1,3,"For all the ""hype"" or excitement over how great the pizza is here it really wasn't that good. Nothing special here. It's a restaurant that let the quality of its food slip because they've been running on their fame for too long. This is New York City , there are so many other places that make a better pizza than Lombardi's. We ordered a small (14"") white pizza for 2 people and the small pie had 6 slices. The dough was nice and thin but they definitely are skimpy with the toppings. Paper thing mozzarella, small strips of basil, few dollops of ricotta and "" garlic"" that was nonexistent. Overall it was an average slice of pizza. Not worth coming back. I think I prefer the taste of an average old pizza shop then Lombardi's. Also just because you name a pie "" famous cake boss pie "" doesn't mean you should make it drastically more expensive than your other pies.Enough with the fame... Focus on making your food better. Service was lack luster. Took them 30 mins to get us water... I asked the busboy for water and he smiled + nodded but never came back. Cool...If you're a tourist or if you've been coming here ""forever"" that's great and understandable. This is probably the first pizza restaurant you will see on a brochure for ""best"" pizza on NYC.

771,Katherine W.,1,5,"The way to my heart is to bring me a slice (or entire pizza) of Lombardi's white pizza.I know that the memory of how delicious the white pizza is from here will haunt me for the rest of my life, IT WAS SO GOOD.We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table and the pizza took about another 15 minutes, it was so good, the crust was thin but still fluffy and man oh man the cheese.... my favorite would have to be the bloops of house made ricotta cheese, melt in your mouth and foodgasm all in one bite. I would fly to NY just to eat the pizza here. Sadly when we came we were unaware they their 101the anniversary was the day before and they were serving pizza for only 5 cents, yup you heard me, the world's best pizza for 5 cents (granted the line was around the block) but it's worth it if you ask me. Random: Lombardi's is America's and New York's first pizzeria.Till next time we meet Lombardi's~Update: I'm now 3 days post Lombardi's and stuck in Texas.... I dream of this pizza and now have a empty hole in my stomach that can never be filled unless it's the White Pizza from here.

773,Alexander Y.,1,5,"One of my biggest regrets in last two visits to New York was that I never bothered to get one of the things this city is known for: its damn pizza. That was partly since the majority of friends that used to live here were Asian, and the other thing was that I (for some reason) never looked into it. I don't need to delve into the history of Lombardi's...let's just say this was a long time coming.Admittedly, not the cheapest pizza you'll find. In fact, since I wasn't paying for it, I pretty much racked it up until it cost me $42 LOL (an 18"" half white/half margherita will do that to you). But man, that was some of the best money ever spent. White pizza = absolute crack. I love me some white pizza with ricotta, but this was straight up unbelievable. Margherita side was pretty good, love the sweet and tangy tomato sauce and how it didn't overpower the senses.Admittedly, part of the price is the experience of being at the most OG of OG pizzerias. But Lombardi's wouldn't be around if it wasn't legit as hell either. Definitely worth!",3/24/2015,636,961,2415,aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg

775,Adrienne D.,1,5,"A peaceful snowy night in NYC, old school Italian pizza, and Frank Sinatra tunes playing...What more could you want? I recently visited NYC and wanted to have a classic NY pizza moment- not a cheap slice (though those are awesome), but a sit-down pizza parlor experience. After a little digging on Yelp, I found Lombardi's and suggested it to my friend who was also down. Off we went on the subway to Nolita, soft snow covering the ground and making it a magical evening.We were quickly greeted once we entered and ushered through a bit of a maze to a table in the back. We perused the menu and I ordered an Italian soda- a sweet strawberry soda with generous whipped cream on top. We decided to split a margherita pizza with mushrooms and olives on top- and before long a tasty thin crust pie arrived to devour. As predicted, it was the ideal fold-over blend of flavors and a slightly chewy crust that you would expect to find at a NYC pizza institution. Even better, the flavors and crust seem to improve after they cool down- we enjoyed some later in the back room at Lit Lounge while Ms. PacMan watched. In summary, this is the place to go if you want an authentic NY pizza experience- it appeared plenty of locals go too and service was friendly and efficient, and they let us linger a bit after eating to catch up.",3/13/2015,2067,692,4034,Qo7qI5r1biiQLrmSpiqXpA

777,Bradley N.,0,3,"The 411: this is a historical landmark for pizza in New York City. Well known for its appearance on travel documentaries, this place is a magnet for tourists and pizza fans the like. I had a pleasant experience and a decent pie at this place, but high price and scant toppings are pushing me to look harder for a better pizza restaurant.I ordered a small 14"" margherita pizza with extra mozzarella cheese and pepperoni. All in all, the extra toppings and the small pizza (with water) came to $40 before tip. Pretty expensive...This place is not without its charms. I experienced friendly service and I got to get a glimpse of the owner of the restaurant...before many people bothered him for a picture.The pizza was pretty darn good. Cooked expertly. Crispy on the edge and just gooey enough in the very center of the pie. You could tell the pepperoni was fresh as it curled around the edges making them look a bit like a red blood cell. The pepperoni was quite scarce for the $5 extra for the topping though...The sauce was also quite tasty. Not too much of it on the pie. It was tangy, not sweet, and you could really taste the tomato.The crust was good in that you could really taste the coals on the edge of the pizza. Good to the last bite.Cheese was gooey and fresh tasting. Mild in flavor too.Basil was also incredibly sparse. I definitely would have appreciated more herb on my pie. After all, a margherita pizza is supposed to have a strong basil taste in my mind. This pie treated the basil more as an afterthought.Bottom line: touristy, though service is good and fast. Expensive, but you can't put a price on history. Scarce toppings, but you could tell they were quality. All in all, I'm glad I went. Will I return? Maybe once more in my lifetime, but I won't go out of my way for it. There's so much more pizza to be eaten.",5/24/2016,14,111,113,uMp8IY7vxi_9UntjYRIMOA

The staff I must say was extremely nice and helpful. I ordered extra cheese and pepperoni. Not my go to choices but i was treating my brother. When in Rome do as the Romans do. My pie took about 15 minutes to cook. Parking is limited in this area so beware.  I took my pizza and as soon as i got in my car i couldnt wait to sink my teeth into a slice.  I questioned my 1st bite because i was expecting more flavor. My 2nd bite confirmed the 1st bite. Unfortunately, this pizza was just, OK. nothing spectacular for me. The crust was thin with a sourdough taste. I like thin crust pizza, but this pizza crust was chewy with a plastic quality. There was no way that i got extra cheese. This pizza hardly had cheese on it. The pepperoni was nice, salty and greasy. Just the way pepperoni should taste. The basil added extra flavor. For 2 people i recommend a large. 1 person could easily finish a small, or maybe im just greedy.  I was disappointed and underwhelmed at the same time. Its not horrible pizza but it didnt give me the taste i craved from all the great reviews and recommendations to try this place.

791,Kevin T.,0,4,"No NYC visit is complete without having some authentic NY pizza. Apparently no one else exemplifies the NY style pizza like Lombardi's. Their use of the now banned coal ovens is said to allow their pizzas to acquire a unique texture and flavor. We stopped in approximately 45 minutes before they were scheduled to close and were promptly reminded that we needed to hurry and order before the kitchen closed. Not exactly the friendliest welcome, but we weren't going to miss this opportunity before our flight out. Right after we were seated, the waitress stood at our table and then reminded us that they were about to close and if we knew what we wanted to order (she hadn't even given us a menu yet). After we explained to her this was our first time, she then handed us a menu and stood there waiting for our order(in case we forgot they would be closing in 40 minutes). We eventually decided on a small margherita pizza with pepperoni, garlic spinach, and meatballs. The pizza came out fresh with some amazingly delicious cheese. The meats were great, and they paired well with the spinach. The crust was chewy with a slight crunch. I'm no pizza expert but aside from the blackened color on the crust, I couldn't discern the difference in flavor or texture between a coal fired pizza vs a wood oven fired pizza. The pizza was delicious nonetheless. The service while prompt, felt lacking. No one likes being rushed, especially when it's well within scheduled business hours.

This is a classic margherita - layer it on please!Overall, I was pleased with my pie but probably won't bother going back.

Evidently the chef and kitchen staff have given up for allowing such a sorry excuse of a pizza to leave their kitchen. Poorly made burnt crust, bland sauce that tasted like it was turning and the skimpiest amount of the worst tasting mozzarella gloop ever; I wouldn't even give my hungry dog a pizza that bad. The wait staff don't seem to care that they serve shit pizza either. Did I mention they serve paper plates and plastic cups to their eat-in diners? Avoid this dump like the plague. This pizza is an insult to Italian cuisine, cooking in general and especially insulting to the legacy of pizza-making in America. After eating at Lombardi's, I had to buy two cheap slices from a late-night pizzeria near my hotel to get the nasty taste of Lombardi's pizza out of my mouth and mind. Caveat Emptor- I went out of my way to find the restaurant that started pizza-making in America.  I was really looking forward to having a good experience eating pizza for the first time in New York. What a waste of precious vacation time! I am so mad at this restaurant for false advertising. This place is the epitome of a tourist trap.

I was in the area with some friends for lunch time and we were seated immediately which was nice (unlike the long wait at grimaldis). We decided to try the clam specialty pizza (the menu says there's limited numbers every day- so come early if you want to try it!) and my vegetarian friend went for a margarita pizza with olives added. Once we got our pies, I was beyond excited for the clam pie. It was loaded with clams throughout and it was very interesting. There was no sauce or cheese (maybe some Parmesan sprinkled on top) so it was quite light. The crust was extremely crunchy and every bite had very flavorful clams in it. I don't usually eat the crust on my pizza but this one was just so thin and crunchy that I couldn't resist. I was very happy with this pie and would highly recommend it. The margarita pizza was simple and done well as well. It didn't particularly blow my mind though. Overall the food here is great. The service was a bit slow and inattentive though. It took us like 20 minutes to get water after we were seated and the server didn't come back after giving us the check so we just left our cash on the table.",7/8/2016,168,12,22,7vi1qGH16pTzOQqEZphyyw

And for drinks we only wanted water which came in these tiny see through plastic cups... overall it wasn't worth it. The pizza is bland and everything is overpriced. Our waiter had no patience with us which made our experience worse. The bill came out to a whopping 80$ and it's a cash only restaurant.

The pizza was perfectly cooked, sauce was great, there was a lack of cheese for sure (sad face). And sad to say for the first time ever I did not like the crust of a pizza!!! This is my favorite part and yet I left it on my plate. Why? Well there was way to much salt in the dough. So great for the ones who pour salt on there food however not for me. Three stars because there is a lack of consistency. A couple next to my table received their pieIn 10 minutes and mine took 35. Plus, theirs had a load of cheese which compelled me to ask the waiter if the ordered extra cheese which to my surprise they did not.",8/24/2016,5,15,12,ftXC23gu2L1cqnwTUlqxHg

When we first got there, It wasn't packed at all, (that was a plus) but we were quickly rushed to order and we noticed the menu said ""3.00 a drink with no refills"" like what the hell? However, We let that go. Then, we noticed the HIGH prices on the pizza, (I get it, it's New York, everything is expensive but at least let it be worth the money!) We still were optimistic about it being great pizza. About 15 mins the food came. . . Thats when we knew we fucked up by coming. A 3 meatball appetizer (10.00$) - 2/10 (very small)Half pepperoni pizza / half white pizza (30.00$) -3/10 (again, very small)Cesar salad (10.00$) -5/10 (a little bowl, it's decent, but don't buy it) ALL the food sucked.

Fortunately, all we wanted was the best pizza in the city.The place feels like you are sitting in and being served a piece of history. It was kinda pricy but hey, it was delicious. I liked the super thin crust which was perfectly crispy to the edges and chewy in just the right places. The coal fired, 18"" large pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza was perfect. The pie was eight large slices. Each slice was big enough to split into another half.You can't go wrong here. If you're Yelping for pizza in NYC, this is THE place to come to.

The large 18"" with 3 toppings (pancetta, Italian sausage, garlic spinach) was not worth the $42 (including tip and tax). Especially for the 30-40 min. wait just for 2 people. Still, the pizza was a decent NY style pizza. Like Grimaldi's they use large chunks of mozzarella, so you see a lot of the tomato sauce peeking through. The sauce was great, very light and slightly garlicy. The pizza needed more spinach, which they were stingy on. The crust was really soggy. Probably the saggiest slice of pizza I have ever eaten, but at least they used a coal oven, which was evident from the black soot on our hands after eating. Just like the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, this place is more of a tourist trap. There are definitely better NY pizza slices elsewhere, but I still say go just to say you've tried it.",11/21/2014,480,894,4994,DC1hfeeSaYr2E1xwiEL81A

It was delicious and tasted somewhat healthier than other pizza places. It was a little soggy though but maybe it supposed to be that way. Because of the soggyness, it was slightly difficult to eat.

Everybody remembers when it was their first time at lombardi. First pizzeria and a historical pizza landmark. Its 110 years and counting. You got to appreciate the history here. There is a reason why kids take field trips to this place. I been here a couple of times in years past. The pizza is always good. I recommend coming here hungry and open your wallet. Pizza isnt cheap but everything is done to a perfection. Since the last time I was here, I believe the menu has changed. It took me awhile to figure out what to order. I usually recommend going with 2 toppings on each pizza (sausage and meatball...do it. You wont regret it). Has the topping option decrease or have I lost the ability to read the menu? It seems less, but I might be wrong here.Today, I had the white, spinach,  sweet italian sausage and margherita.  Trying something different here. 2 large pies. 1 topping each and the regular white and marghertia. It was good but it wasnt two topping good. The sause was sweet and the melting cheese. The taste is just heavenly.  its worth the trip-tourist or not. Its an experience.

I'm going to skip everything and go straight to the food because who needs to know about the decor, location, and crap like that when you have food this good. But if you must know, it's got a nice homey feel to it, very mom and pop type shop. My friends and I got the clam pie and half a white pie with sausage and half margherita with sauteed garlic spinach on the entire pizza. Everything was just superb! The clam pie has more clams on it than you buying a 3lb pound bag at $10 a pound. Seriously, it was just covered in clams. The quantity alone was impressive but it also tasted really good. It's dry pie so there is no sauce but that fresh lemon really just does it! Their white pie and margherita also did not disappoint. The mozzarella and the tomatoes were perfect and the sauce was full of flavor! On the white pie they have swirls of ricotta cheese baked on top which was a nice surprise for me. I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese but it did taste good alongside everything else. It was really everything I had hoped it would be, and just affirmed my love for NY style pizzas! love, love, love this place and thank you Lombardi's for introducing pizzerias in America.",11/5/2014,657,572,542,aFfbVxPah25PrdwDj9l17g

We grabbed a few drinks at the bar while waiting for our friend, and were seated when she got there. The restaurant is surprisingly large so there was no wait, but your entire party needs to be present to get seated. We were hoping to order their famous Clam Pie... unfortunately they didn't have any clams that evening!! :( We started off with a Bruschetta appetizer and for the main course we ordered a large Half Margherita/Half Mozzarella & Ricotta and added spinach, sausage, and pancetta to both sides. The pizza was great -- your classic New York style thin crust pizza. The dough was chewy with the perfect light crunch. The tomato sauce is sweet and a little tangy which goes well with all the toppings. The white pizza was a table favorite, creamy and savory all in one. The service was fantastic, very attentive and helpful. If you're ever in NYC and looking for some authentic pizza, definitely stop by Lombardi's to get your fix.

I was right. From the atmosphere to the food, we were not disappointed. We had the breadsticks, meatballs, and classic pizza. EVERY bit was delicious. The sauce was sweet yet still tangy. If I could have fit it, I would have eaten more. Please give this place a shot. You won't regret it. :)",10/27/2017,52,7,10,kSuXQ2YCSPou_kdOPvPgVA
846,Juan G.,0,3,"On this trip to NY the family and I made it a point to eat at Lombardi's since we read so much about it.  On our two prior trips to the city we always had great pizza.  Much better than we can find here in southern California.The pizza was good but not better than any of the other pizza places that we have tried in the past and on this third trip.  I agree with the other reviews on yelp.  The pizza needed more sauce and they were kind of light on the toppings.  And more importantly, i agree that it was overpriced compared to other pizza places.I can now say that I ate at famous Lombardi's but I would never go back again.  Its not woth the price.  Too many places in the city that are just as good or better, and cheaper.  To me this place feels like a tourist trap.  I think that they are just living off their reputation as the city's first pizzeria.PS..The service was good.  The waiters were very attentive and porefessional.",6/18/2017,0,13,0,v4cmHlsOI7z7VRePz73iSA
847,Kevin T.,0,4,"Quite an experience coming to the first U.S. pizzeria.We tried the clam pie served with 3 dozen clams on a crispy thin pizza crust. It was one of those pies where the ingredients really outshone the dough that it laid on. The clams were soft and not too chewy, and there were plenty of them in each bite. Squeeze some lemon juice and  add some pepper flakes before beginning and you'll have a good time.They really don't have much seating so be prepared to wait an hour or more for a table. I would say that it's worth it just to experience the history of the place, which you are reminded of from all of the memorabilia framed on the wall.",3/28/2017,239,242,0,YOnXR7KaHbO2oLKVEsiDSA

850,Ladiny P.,0,3,"I came here a couple of years ago for my birthday and it became my favorite pizza spot. I remember the sauce of the pizza tasting rich in tomatoes and the ratio between the tomato sauce, cheese and bread was perfect (main because I love tomato sauce). Because there was 6 of us, we had a nice open seating area with a big table.Recently, I decided to come here for my brother's belated birthday dinner (mainly because the place we wanted to go to was closed for a private party event). When we arrived, it was not completely crowded and we were taken to a table that required us to go completely around the restaurant entrance to the other side of the restaurant. I was sort of disappointed as to where we were seated because we were pretty much near the bathroom and kitchen. Also, there was hardly any space between tables (literally only one person could pass through) and the chairs as well as tables were small. My brother and I decided to order the large margherita pizza with whole mushroom toppings, which came out to be $29.90 (including tax). Salivating while waiting for the pizza to come, I was imagining the taste I remember having on my 21st birthday with my friends. However, when it did come out our table hardly had any space for our plates. The already cramped space we had got even more cramped when our pizza came out. Literally, my brother and I had to hold our pizza slices on our plates while eating them. Eventually we ate enough slices to split them on our plates and have the main pizza plate taken away. In terms of the taste, I was rather disappointed. The pizza was not as rich as I remembered. Instead, the tomato sauce tasted a bit watered down, and it was obviously not seasoned as much as I remembered. The texture of the bread, mushroom and cheese was just as how I remembered it: fresh, stretchy and natural. Being how tomato sauce is my favorite component of pizza, I was disappointed in what I paid for. Maybe my taste buds changed within the two years since I had this pizza or their quality went down, but to me this spot has become a mediocre spot for pizza.Food: pretty average pizza, the bread, cheese and mushrooms had the perfect balance of soft, with crunchy edges, oozing cheese and fresh mushrooms. Tomato sauce was disappointing, a bit too watery and hardly seasoned.Appearance: very old school, authentic 1960's design, clearly a lot of history Service: okay service, friendly waiter, but took a while for him to come over when we asked for himPrice: worth it for the portion (large for like $29), as for taste, it was okayIf you are ever in the area, and want a quick bite of pizza, I'd say come here. I would say it is pretty affordable, but not really the top spot for pizza in NYC.",3/16/2016,85,57,228,G2TmEIn7n3hVnEGnDwb2Iw
851,Michele F.,0,3,"What kind of pizza lover would I be if I didn't stop by the first pizzeria in America? Opened since 1905, I was excited to try their pizza. No wait. We got lucky on a Friday evening. We were seated right away. The decor is charming and decorated with photos of celebs, tables covered with red and white checkered tablecloths, brick walls, awards, your usual pizzeria decor. We couldn't decide between the two different types of pizza so the server said we could get 1/2 and 1/2 on that particular combo. It was 1/2 margherita and 1/2 white small pizza with the addition of pepperoni. The small pizza is enough for two people, possibly three if you're all light eaters. We had ordered Grandma's meatballs as an app. I wasn't a fan of the meatballs but my husband liked them. I was expecting fireworks to go off when I bit into their pizza but that didn't happen. It was a little overwhelming and just decent. Nothing I would go out of my way for but it's one of the places you must visit if you love pizza and happen to be visiting New York. No issues with service. Don't forget to bring cash.",2/18/2016,160,199,1323,TS4RfxKny-c8QYcnMpfkiQ
852,Mike C.,1,3,"This is another one of the ""New York institutions"" with a perpetual wait that is not at all worth it.Maybe it used to be really good, but now it has become a full-blown tourist trap with $30+ pies and t-shirts for sale.If you ever want to eat here and it's past 6 PM on a weekend, it's game over. I hadn't had it for years, and we happened to be in the area and willing to eat at about 5:30 PM, so we gave it a shot. It was still a 20 minute wait, but that's not bad considering there are usually throngs of fanny pack-wearing families suffering out front for at least an hour.We started with Grandma's Meatballs ($11), which comes with 2 huge meatballs that were quite good.For the pie, it's cool that they let you get half and half so you can try the different styles. We got half Margherita ($23.50 for a large) and half White ($26.50 for a large). We added sausage and pepperoni to the Margherita side and the whole pie ended up costing $34.50, which is pretty damn pricey, considering the quality just wasn't up there with several other better pizza shops in NYC.The Margherita side was the better of the two, though it was a little too floppy for me and got a bit soggy by the end of the meal. For the White Pie, make sure you can really handle a lot of cheese, because the huge dollops of ricotta sent me over the edge.Service is nonexistent, but you can't really blame them since they must constantly deal with tourists that don't realize you have to tip in America.The pizza here is good, and probably worth trying at least once for completeness, but otherwise not worth the wait and the prices.",9/12/2014,5000,1736,73167,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q

854,Cee K.,0,3,"It's a rule for me to eat at a pizza spot when I'm in New York and this was the highest rated spot.Originally we wanted just one pie since we had been eating random things while walking through NY but our server pressured us to get two. She went on to say that Lombardi's is historic with the best pizza in New York and that we would regret not getting two. We ordered an original margherita and a pepperoni/meatball. HUGE slices. I appreciate the fresh ingredients but the pizza did not blow me out the water. The server even poked fun at us for not finishing and asked if we were from California, ha!I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere. I respect the pride in this place but I question if they're stuck in their historic bubble.",2/19/2016,269,220,322,o65m3ddoFQHX6fkpnWfxPQ
855,Monique L.,0,5,Each time I come to NY this is a must! The pizza is delicious and fresh. Never been disappointed. It is cash only so come prepared and be ready for a bit of a wait.

856,Vivian Y.,0,2,"Very very average. Me, like others fell into the Lombardi's hype. After being turned down from Roberta's (which was a 2 hour wait on a weeknight), our group of 5 turned to Yelp to find the next closest pizza joint. Lombardi's was around the block and there we went. When we got there, there was absolutely no wait whatsoever. Our hostess led us upstairs and through various alley (I swear it's like Hogwarts in here) until we got to our table. The menu is short, only 1 page back and forth. We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer, their white pizza (with meatballs and sauteed spinach), and their famous clam pizza for entrees. The appetizer came out fast and the bruschetta was pretty sub-par. It was very obvious that they used canned tomatoes instead of fresh. Their portion sizes were much bigger than we thought though.We were getting incredibly hungry and then our pizzas arrived. It took probably half an hour after our appetizer for the pizza to come and that's a no go in my books. IMO the pizza tasted completely flavorless. The ""famous"" clam pizza was hard and lackluster. It just tasted like hard bits on top of cheese. Their white pizza....was even grosser. None of us could eat it without topping it with loads of pepper and chili flakes.For the price that we paid at Lombardi's, it was definitely not worth it. Heck, I wouldn't even come back if they halved the price. There was absolutely no taste in any of the food that I tried that night. I rather stay at home and ordered Dominos in. At least, I know I would be satisfied.",2/17/2016,276,158,548,xyxXDjzEWTE8I8xN5FPgNQ

It was quite surprising that we didn't have to wait for the table.   The service was ok nothing special, but I can't blame them considering how many people were there. We just got a half half pizza with white pizza on one side and Margarita on the other with the house made meatballs on both sides. I personally liked the margarita better because the white pizza was just too much for me. It was really cheesy and just super thick in its creaminess. I think the pizza was not much better with the meatballs, in fact I don't really recommend them.   Overall it was a pretty okay experience, I actually recommend Joe's Pizza or Famous Ben's pizza, but that's for a thin crust, not too cheesy pizza lover like me.",5/30/2016,2,5,14,R9XWZa8i0FgHkhvfxSIoAA

I ordered the margarita pizza. Cheese pizza is my favorite pizza lol. Lombardi's pizza has mild flavors, good think crust not crunchy but I believe I have had better, Sorry. I think $1 pizza can compete with Lombardi's. I just don't see what the hype is about. You don't need reservation but when i came 4 years ago the lines went down the block... So yea, for dinner it would be best to call for a reservation. A small pizza will be good for two. It comes with 6 slices. I had three with a beer and I feel satisfied. I love the decor. Feels and looks like I am in Italy lol. Soft music is playing in the background. Really laid back place. Overall is a good pizza, but don't limit your self to just this place.

867,Rashmi G.,1,4,"When in New York, eat pizza like the New Yorkers, right? Well based on the things we knew, Lombardi's helped us meet that criteria! We found this place by doing some searching on Yelp and we thought it lived up to expectations! I had not had authentic New York style pizza before so I was ready for a treat. We arrived right at lunch time but surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't busy yet. We were taken to the back of the restaurant almost near the other exit door. The tables around us quickly filled up as we sat, browsing the menu.We decided on a regular pizza with spinach, onions, and meatballs. It look a little bit of time for the pizza to come out, but it was well worth the wait. I'm a huge fan of spinach and onions so I knew I'd love those toppings on the pizza but the meatballs were even really good. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.The service was just alright. We weren't asked if we we wanted anything else but rather just brought out the check after were were finished.

868,Kristina L.,1,4,"Came here twice, at first I wasn't that much of a fan, but then 4 years later I tried it again and definitely delicious.They don't sit your party until everyone is here, so don't be late or make sure no one in your party is. I know I am guilty of that....the up side was although it was a weekend, it was a cold winter weekend, so no one was out and we didn't have to wait for a table.Service: is good, nothing special, but they were attentive to every thing that we needed (water, refills, etc).What I had 2nd time around:1. CalzoneMeatball and Italian sausage with marinara sauce on the side-Was not what I remembered the first time. In my head I remembered it being better than the pizza, but this one was made not as good. -I thought it had too much cheese and it wasn't melted enough.2. Margherita pizza Sweet Italian sausage with onions and tomatoes-OMG delicious! I didn't think I would like it, but it was amazing! -The tomato sauce was very fresh and I like how it wasn't too cheesy-The sausage was very yummy and flavorful 3. If you come with 4 people and you all want soda, I suggest just getting a pitcher. It was probably enough for all of us to have almost 2 cups. Price: came out to be about $20 per person, but hey your paying for grommet pizza. CASH ONLY! do not forget! they have it written in red on the top left (not like its bold or anything, but surprisingly it did catch my eye). They should probably put some bigger signs on the menu.

The mozzarella cheese was on point. Price wasn't your average ordinary pizzeria cost, but well worthy of the number. Service was great, very attentive to their guests. Love the layout to their restaurant, something about the red and white checkered table cloths gave it more authenticity, haha. Not sure about other customers, but no wait when I went.

Honestly, many pizza places in NYC offer the same New York pizza taste for $1/2 per slice while a slice here averages about $6 and they also do not sell per slice. I got half white and half margarita with pancetta. The white pizza has huge chucks of ricotta and not the usual buttery-cheesy taste of white pizza. Instead, it was super creamy in a not so appetizing way. The margarita was much better, but regardless, I've had better in the city for cheaper. The restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere and a lot of hype. The workers are very friendly and efficient. But for the price of the food, I do not think it is worth going to again.TIP: They only accept cash here!",6/7/2015,357,57,94,87yDspNg9HFoPqV0A-heZg
873,Allister D.,1,4,"I'm so thankful to eat at the first pizzeria in the U.S. After waiting a couple years, I finally got to witness the store and try their original Margherita pizza. Me and my friend ordered a small which is about 6 large slices of flat brick-oven pizza. The tomato sauce was the star of the show. It was fresh to the max; the finely puréed tomato with its chunks still shown, the sweetness from the the ripe tomato itself, and the bright color it gives off. It's so fresh it's almost red-pink color. The mozzarella cheese is laid flat on top of the pizza and has its soft texture. The cheese isn't over done which is great because the pizza is doesn't become gooey. The crust and bottom portion of the pizza is just right in terms of timing. The dough is slightly chewy which means it's obviously made by bare hands using a secret dough recipe.I recommend coming here to have the original pizza because it makes sense and sets the intro to what Lombardi's has to offer. This is the perfect pitch to customers like me who are traveling here to witness.",6/7/2015,916,1762,1790,cJCYCEfDL4n5TgU9y8RTWg

While we were planning out places to eat, we knew that pizza is a MUST in New York, and we were happy to find this little gem- the first pizzeria in the US!It's located right outside of Little Italy in Nolita. The atmosphere inside is just what you would imagine if you were thinking of an old fashioned pizza place. We got there around 3:00 on a Friday afternoon, and most of the tables were filled. I can imagine if you come closer to dinner or lunch, there would be a wait. The service was OK- not too much interaction with the waiter but the food was served quick, which was great because I was starving! We decided on the large marghertia pizza with peperoni. This is just their ""plain"" pizza with an added topping. The sauce is so fresh and has the perfect amount of sweetness to it. You can tell that there are little ingredients in this sauce which I personally love! There was also the perfect amount of fresh mozzarella cheese & peperoni distributed on the pizza. I also loved that it was super thin & was crunchy! The prices are for sure a little too high for pizza in my opinion, the large pizza with peperoni ended up being over $30 & it's cash only so make sure to have some on you- if not there is an ATM inside.

I'm sure its considered a typical New York pizza and it is huge and delicious but definitely not the best pie in the area, only just a famous one.The interior is very retro, like it never changed but in a good way. The place for receiving so much traffic is actually clean yet crowded. The tables are nestled into just about every corner possible, it's amazing how servers still manage to get around.I was a little scared to try this place being how touristy it was, so I was expecting shit service. Wrong!Despite the crowdedness, staff was efficient, fast and friendly! I ordered a half white pizza and the margarita pizza. The serving is very large for just two people but we ended up killing it regardless. I like that the pizza wasn't overly greasy despite the mounds of cheese littered on the pie. The white pizza was good, but I definitely had to spice it up with some flavor and loaded it with crushed peppers and garlic.Overall? I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't make a special trip to this place living in NY.

Besides the restaurant itself, I really liked Little Italy and the adjoining China Town- Fun area to hang around in. Don't think i ll be back here in Lombardi's though.

887,Stephanie L.,1,4,"For those visiting New York, this is the first pizzeria opened in New York. That should tell you a lot about this place and it's authenticity.It's thin crust pizza and they use a brick coal oven to bake their pizzas.Their menu isn't very extensive at all. First, pizza or calzone?If pizza, White Pizza or Margherita Pizza?Any Extra toppings? $3 each. Pepperoni?Sausage?Mushrooms?Pancetta?Meatballs? Etc.... (You can also do toppings on half the pizza for $2 each topping)Size? Small or Large?I've been here twice now. Both times I've ordered a small Margherita pizza.First time, I dined in and ordered the original with no toppings. The bottom of the pizza was burnt and you can taste it with every bite. Not impressed my first visit.There was also no line and we were seated immediately. The pizza takes about 15 mins to make, so expect to wait a little for your freshly baked pizza.However, my second visit, the wait for a table of 2 was about 30-45 mins. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to dine in. Instead, we ordered to-go. The pizza took about 10 mins and we took it back. The pizza cooled down a bit before I got to eat it, but it tasted a lot better the second time around. We also added sausage to it. The crust wasn't burnt at all and was a perfect combination of crispy and doughiness. What also made the second try amazing was adding the garlic powder. Just sprinkle it on top.....and amazzingggg. It brought more flavor to the pizza as well as enhanced the tomato and mozzarella making the pizza twice as good. Tip: when dining in, ask for fresh garlic, but when you order delivery or take out they tend to give you garlic powder.I also recommend eating the pizza while it's hot. The mozzarella is melted and stretchy when you eat it hot....yummmm.A small is way more than enough to feed 2 people. Their slices are big.FYI, cash only. Average about $20 a pizza, also varies enormously with how many toppings you add. And they do deliver :D.They don't take reservations either, so there can be a wait/line sometimes.Will definitely be back when I'm in New York to try their pizza with meatballs. And Lombardi's is only in New York (making it very unique and special) while it's competitor Grimaldi's has expanded to multiple nationwide locations.Conclusion = must go when in New York!",9/3/2014,589,390,3487,ZdY3VTgSHaLgCfnRZEeosQ

The pizza was good and the service was really good and quick as well. I personally liked the margherita more. We got fresh tomatoes on top which was very good as well.

902,Kara M.,1,4,"Quite the pizza joint here, pretty old school and pretty epic. I love the classic checkered table clothes.They technically don't take reservations, but when we called ahead and told them we'd be a party of 14, they happily let us make one. I don't know how big of a party you have to be to make a reservation, but we didn't have a problem. You do all have to be there in order to be seated! We were taken to the back back upper area, through the kitchen to the upstairs where it was a bit more private which was perfect for our large group. We had several bottles of wine, pitchers of beer and a LOT of pizza. We started with some appetizers too, salads and antipastos, which were just decent. The pizza was good. Very good. I won't say the best. It's classic though. And honestly, my favorite was just the classic margherita pizza, with nothing fancy. I think the crust was little dry though. We had a few meat pizzas, a few vegetarian pies and a plain. I believe 6 pies in all for all of us! Our waiter was attentive and always seemed to be around, but he had a good staff helping him out. It's also crazy to charge that amount for pizza and be a cash only joint. Our bill total was not something to blink at! And no, they didn't include gratuity even though we were a huge group. I'd come back again, especially because I really want to try the white pie! The photos look awesome. We did have to go downstairs to use the restroom which was a little inconvenient, but not the end of the world.",3/29/2015,486,230,532,sDZ4vvKthUUNgqU926VhMQ
903,Tyler L.,1,4,"Lombardi's claims to have invented the NYC pizza style, and they certainly do have the feel of a long lived New York institution. The restaurant is traditional pizza joint through and through with a busting energy and sticky tables. The space is somehow huge and yet doesn't fit the big crowds, so be prepared for a wait or go for takeout. Pies are on the pricey side, around $25 for one topping which is steep. You do however get a tasty slice of traditional pie with some NYC history thrown in. The crust is chewy and delicious as is the cheese. Any meat topping is top notch as well and well seasoned. Perfect for a cold night when you just want to sit at home with a delicious pie.",1/9/2016,195,1631,1308,hN03Wim4nDQ-824277aEsQ
904,Michael S.,0,2,"Not a fan of the lack of cheese on pizza. We had the original margarita pizza which is a bit overpriced for the size. A small will be around the size for a piology personal pizza. But unlike piology this place is very stingy with the toppings, e.g 4 dollars to add pepperoni. A small will run you 22+ tip. At that price you don't even get real plates here,  maybe it was just on the day I went but they served us on paper plates. On top of that they don't take cards, so it's cash only in 2017, and in NYC no less. The margarita had sauce, a couple spots of mozzarella, and minimal basil, that's it. Pizza taste super weird when it's mainly just sauce on dough. The restaurant was nice though and it is super close to China town and little Italy. All in all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone because there are tons of pizza places in the city that serve better slices at better prices.

907,Kyle H.,0,3,"Hard to beat up on Lombardi's. Any pizza shop that can stay in business for 100+ years in New York deserves respect. That said, the combination of a limited menu, mediocre pizza, high prices ($25 for a 16"" cheese pizza is highway robbery) and cash only service, among other inconveniences, just make this a hard ""pass"". If you want the most traditional NYC pizza experience, at the right price for the inconveniences, head to John's Pizzeria on Bleecker Street.That said, it's fine if you're dying to try it and have reasonable expectations. Also, it is a hit with kids - brought my 13 yr old brother here to introduce him to NY style pizza (he's used to Pizza Hut and Domino's) and he thought the margherita was excellent.",8/13/2017,151,18,3,m9urli9mlXTNQN5YW413Ow

They have these really fancy pictures on the walls that explain how they've been endorsed by celebrities but it's just bait to try to make you to stay. I kid you not, we went to a cheaper location afterwards that charged us 2 dollars a slice and it tasted infinitely better than Lombardi's.

I recently went again with a group of friends and enjoyed the company, but not the experience. We went on a Monday evening at 6pm and the wait was already 40 minutes +.  Large groups of people were filing into the tiny doorway and spilling out the door, instead of sending one person to put their names down for their party. It was filled with rude tourists who push past other people, I was disgusted with the whole experience. The host/hostess will hand you an electronic device (similar to what they hand out at Outback Steakhouse) and it will buzz once your table is ready.We ended up ordering 2 large pies with different flavors to satisfy the various palates within our group of six.

Just know that this pizza is not really the kind you order to-go. I believe this pizza should be enjoyed on the premises, hot and fresh. Now while pizza lovers will attest that cold pizza is still good pizza, believe me, you'll want this one right out of the oven. Other than that, you can't go wrong. Oh yeah, this place can get pretty busy so expect a wait. It is also a tight squeeze so don't expect a whole lot of room to stretch out.

The place is fairly big and it is adorable! I loved the ambiance and the lighting. The place welcomes you with a warm feeling with its table covers and attentive service. I love coal oven pizzas, and Lombardi's delivers amazing pizza with the perfect flavor and amount of crispiness to it. We ordered the margherita pizza with italian sauage and sauteed spinach. It was drool-worthy delicious. We didn't realize we could've order half margherita and half something else, but not a problem because we were not disappointed one bit.

Favorites are a Pepperoni Pizza and Buddy's Arugula & Prosciutto (don't waste your time/money on the breadsticks definitely not as good as the pizza).NOTE: Cash only but they do have an ATM outside.

Delicious! Pizza starts with there basic margherita (fresh mozzarella, home made tomato sauce, and herbs). We ordered the large pizza, which is about $23 and added toppings.. Their meat toppings are about 4 dollars each, and we put pancetta, sausage, and pepperoni. And on half we added onions, red peppers, and mushrooms which are about $3 each... The large was enough for four with a few slices to take home. We also ordered a pitcher of their brooklyn lager.Overall, great food and service... They are timely and friendly. Restaurant definitely has an italian feel to it. Has the owner's photo around the restaurant with all the celebrities that have ate there.

925,Nicole D.,1,2,"We were told a 5 to 10 minute wait. I think we waited about 15 minutes, which is fine, but it was annoying to see parties that came in after us seated before us. Not sure why that happened, but it was frustrating especially without an explanation. When we were finally seated, we had to walk through the kitchen, literally, to get to a small back room with cramped tables. The menu is small with not a lot of options. We got the margherita pizza which was basically a plain pie with tomato sauce and some splotches of mozzarella (not cheese covering the whole pizza like I was expecting). It was fine, but not worth the exorbitant price tag. I don't think I had ever seen a $35 pizza before (I think ours was only $25, but some of the other ones with toppings were $35!!). This price is especially high when you consider that this is an absolute no-frills type of place where you are served on paper plates and with plastic cups! AND it is cash-only, making the price even more ridiculous. I was very turned off and wouldn't go back.

Upon reading the yelp reviews, and just hearing the history of Lombardi's - I knew I wanted to have our anniversary dinner here. We were greeted warmly as we entered. Even though from the outside it seems small, it is a lot more spacious than I thought! We were brought down stairs, and it was very cute! There were 8 tables, and they had Christmas lights up. Our waitress actually had the full downstairs dining room, and even though she had 8 tables, we  never had to wait too long for anything.We started w/ the breadsticks w/ marinara. Although, the flavor and texture of the bread was good. There was just something lacking a little bit. I feel that if  instead of marinara if it was served w/ olive oil and pesto or balsamic that would have been perfect! Whenever we try a new pizza place, we always like to keep it basic. We just ordered the small original margarita. It was a perfect combination of sauce, cheese and basil. Cooking in the coal oven was great! I really like the flavor that that oven is able to provide. Getting here is pretty easy. Few different subway stops, and then just a few blocks and you are there! Luckily, we are really not that far away, so coming back here is relatively easy.

927,Aaron E.,1,4,"At Lombardi's Pizza everything feels like tradition. The Little Italy locale, tables of girlfriends toasting with glasses of beer, and the walls donned with pictures of stars from film and and screen seemingly everywhere.It is no secret that Lombardi's Pizza is credited with being the first to offer Pizza in America, which in itself is an amazing claim. If you are expecting luxe and lounge like environs, you will be disappointed as this is a pizza joint first and a tourist trap second. After a 2 beer wait (roughly 25 minutes) we walked through the working kitchen and were seated in the back dining area which was a tad stuffy for the time of year, but hardly a deal killer. It took no time to agree upon the Margherita pie which weighs in at a pricey $35.00 al a carte. Within 15 minutes we had the pizza in front of us. The pie itself is about as straight forward as it gets as the restaurant relies on the ancient ovens to produce the flavor of the pizza. Fresh mozzerlla is melted over a somewhat muted basil marinara sauce and a thin and cracker like crust. The mouthfeel is fair if not a touch soft to the tooth in my opinion. I was expecting a much smokier flavor and I was not alone in voicing my opinion on that aspect. Don't get me wrong, it is hardly a bad pie. It is just that I was expecting an earth shifting experience from all of the pomp and flair surrounding the name Lombardi's. Would I suggest Lombardi's Pizza to first time New York visitors? Absolutely. Would I return myself? In a city of this size and its countless pizza options available, most likely not.

The food quality I would probably give roughly 3 stars, but the price was a one star.  We got a half margerhita, half white pizza, the anti pasta, and meatballs.  The half margarita was probably an 8/10 flavor wise, but I would consider that around average in nyc. The white was ok, just nothing special. It looked a lot better than it tasted. The antipasta and meatballs were average nothing spectacular. We got 2 drinks each and our bill was well over 100 dollars before tip. Her sangria was pretty good though, maybe the best thing there. I was just let down with the overall experience the food wasn't that bad, but the experience just didn't justify the price or time spent.",7/2/2014,65,51,2,PBAv29X_DxfaHXUMidwsnw
929,Sally K.,0,2,"Meh. I've experienced better. Stopped by on Thanksgiving around 3pm. Expectedly, there wasn't a wait because who comes to eat pizza on Thanksgiving? (heh) We sat two tables away from the entrance. Its warm toned bricked walls and Frank Sinatra soundtrack makes it somewhat homey. We got the original Margherita pizza and another one with mushrooms and sausage as our toppings (see photos attached). I was surprised at how short we waited for our pizza. Both pies came out relatively fast. We enjoyed the pizza and ate it all within minutes. I can see why some people say you need to try it but personally, it's not a go-to place for me. The two stars are for the pizza. The service, or the lack thereof, was so disappointing. I expected it to be good because of how popular this place is. But it was so subpar. I'm not paying the damn high price for only your pizza but for my whole entire dining experience. Regardless of their unprofessional, discourteous and ill mannerisms, we left a good amount of tip. Trust me though, we won't come back. But it's going to be okay for y'all 'cause you have the tourists that come for your name and not your service.",12/18/2017,49,91,689,DwVcCrkwLdpd9PXj3NYbYQ

933,Janet T.,0,5,"Lombardi's is known as the first New York Pizza in New York City so if you are looking for legit, great tasting, savory pizza then you have to try this place. Ambiance: The place was quiet on a Wednesday night. We got a pizza to go and waited at the bar while our food was ready. When you order the food to go you have to go in the back and order it with a waitress. The place has an old Italian feel to it and even the bar looked like it was from the early 60's design. There is the usual white and red checkered table clothes and Italian music playing in the background. The place was fairly lit with a low noise level. However, I am not sure how loud it can get if it is packed! Service: The waitress was very sweet. She recommended the traditional Margherita pizza. We got two Margherita pizza's, one with pepperoni and the other with sausage. The food came out in about 20-minutes.Food: We ate a slice of pizza before we left the restaurant to get a taste of it fresh out of the oven! It was delicious. The texture of the dough and crust was incredible with a hint of chewiness, which is signature for New York Style pizza's. The tomato sauce was tangy and fresh. The cheese was melted perfectly and was not overwhelming the pizza. The sausage and pepperoni went well as a topping, but I understand why some just eat the Margherita pizza by itself because it is already good! When we ate the pizza at a friends house, it still tasted great. Price: This was pricey! For two pies, it cost us about $50 because it cost like $25 for a large pizza and $5 per topping. It was definitely worth it though! I would come back here 1,000 times just to eat the Margherita pizza. I recommend anyone traveling to NY for the first time to try this place. It was not very busy because we went on a weekday in November, but I hear the lines and waits get pretty long on the weekends!",8/13/2018,492,107,290,kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw

Don't get me wrong, it was a great experience and the food was delicious but honestly - not worth what I paid. Inside, the decor is very homey and ""Italian."" We waited about 3 minutes for a table on a Sunday evening. There was a line, but I think bigger parties had more of a wait. We started off with the meatball appetizer. It seemed odd that it came out like about 2 minutes after we ordered it. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but just odd that it came out so quickly. We also ordered the half white, half margarita pizza... On point! I liked the margarita more, but the white was good too - the size small was sufficient for a party of two. Excellent service but be prepared to pay close to $50 for a pizza and appetizer. It's a little odd to pay that much for ""ambiance,"" service and to serve our food on paper plates. And the other downfall is that this establishment is CASH Only - um, what century are we in? Very inconvenient. Sorry, Lombardi's is good but not worth the hype.",11/21/2016,1283,384,2065,9TWgmxmhL_y5zF2s9S2TQA
941,Kim V.,0,3,"We got here on a Saturday night at about 8:30pm and had a 30 minute wait. So far, so good! But wait! Not so soon.We ordered a small half Margherita half white pizza, which was 14"" and had six slices total. Since that's just a plain pizza, we also added pepperoni, Italian sausage, and sautéed spinach. Note: every single topping you add is extra, so don't be too extra.Once it came out, I dove right into the white pizza first. It was good, and I love that the cheese blobs cake out a little toasty like a brûlée meringue! The Margherita was also good, but after we were finished, I sat there struggling to figure out how that pizza was worth $23.50 + $11 toppings.. long story short it wasn't. We didn't get any drinks and after tax and tip, our bill was $44. For that price, I expect a gourmet pizza that is off the charts and blows my mind like no other pizza has done before, but it didn't. On top of that, this place is cash only and serves you with paper plates and plastic cups. It may just be me, but that's a giant profit margin to not want to afford some better utensils (even if you wanted to keep the traditional feel, I'm sure there are better options). I didn't listen to the other overpriced reviews on here because I wanted to make my own judgment, but...... I think it's overpriced.",10/17/2017,861,56,23,JeGfQZ5tcMTu67DO7kMRHQ

Got there just before the early dinner rush unfolded.Ordered a large pie with pancetta, pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. The crust was just right both thickness and consistency. Meats were evenly cooked with my fav being the itilan sausage. Even the Parmesan cheese had a certain level of freshness. I have tasted New York pizza from many places but endorse this place as to try if you are ever on this part of Manhattan. My only gripe is the tables are very small, and I came very close to having an entire pie land in my lap due to the limited eating space clearance between my plate and pie on the pedestal.

948,Janelle V.,1,2,"Being from out of town and only in the city for one night, we decided we just HAD to try Lombardi's after carefully researching which pizzeria was THE pizza joint to go to while in New York City we decided on Lombardi's.  & Since it's the first pizzeria in America....we said YES, TO LOMBARDI'S WE WILL TRAVEL. Unfortunately we got there fifteen minutes before closing time and we weren't given the option to dine-in. So reader beware, don't think you can get your late-night pre-game grub on at Lombardi's. We then decided on take-out, but were informed that if we decide on this option we would not be allowed to sit in the restaurant at all to eat the pizza. While this totally understandable, it added to disappointment in our experience. The servers were generally nice and kindly took our pizza order, but I can't say anything beyond that for service.Also, I didn't like that in order to get a pizza from here you had to a buy a whole pizza...so if you just want a slice. No yeah, don't come here unless you're splitting it between friends. When we finally received our pizza and were able to find a nice and relatively warm and dry place to eat it on the streets of New York, we weren't too impressed. While the quality and authenticity of the pizza is definitely present, it's not to die for. It's not something I would go out of my way to get to again. I think that this place is overhyped, but if you follow the food movements (which I won't even lie I do myself) then definitely stop by and see for yourself, but as for me? You probably won't find me coming to Lombardi's next time I'm visiting New York City.",12/8/2014,767,400,989,BE2JZ9cll61q8SqqJFD3rA

Three dollars for a plastic cup of ice tea and no refills? 4.50 for a plastic cup of seltzer water?

958,McKenna P.,0,4,"CASH ONLY! ATM available on site. We intended to visit a pizzeria around the corner, but the wait was too long, so I did a Yelp search and settled on Lombardi's based on the number and quality of their reviews. Their seating process is very efficient- there was no wait and we were seated immediately. The host radios another staff member on foot who quickly searches for an open table to accommodate your party. The restaurant is very large and charming with surprisingly fair prices. We ordered the large Margherita because it was only a couple dollars more than the small. Our pizza was delivered within ten minutes and was perfectly cooked. The red sauce was very tangy and unique. I remember seeing the option to purchase a jar of it on the menu for under $10 and now I'm wishing I would have done so. The cheese was also very unique. It melted very flat and even and had great flavor. The crust was thin, but not so thin you have to use a knife and fork rather than holding it. At $24.50 for a large we were pleased with the price. We even commented we would have paid as much as $30 for it. While sitting at the table and looking around at the wall decor we realized they have been open since 1905 and claim to be the very first pizzeria in North America! We visited their website firstpizza.com and read their story.

When I called to inquire about the small size, the woman at the shop insisted it was a large, that it was ""16 inches"" and 8 slices (the box itself was 16 inches, the pie itself, around 13).

If I have other options for food - chances are i'll choose those but when in New York you eat pizza and I'm SO very glad we did. This is by far the best pizza i've ever had. When you first see it you don't think much of it and wonder if you will get good flavor since the cheese is in little pieces but don't let that fool you. The crust was thin and crisp. The sauce was light but rich in flavor. The cheese was perfect... salty and thick with a great pull to it. The pepperoni was also just right in flavor with a little kick. There is truly nothing that was wrong with this pizza. Every bit was a perfect balance of it all. The menu doesn't offer much and it is cash only so be prepared. It's a bit pricy for pizza but totally worth it... This pizza changed the whole game for me...

It's like they ran out of mozzarella right before they served us. It tasted fine, but this was really not my preference for pizza. Also the small pie is not nearly enough for two people. I feel like I could've polished off one all by myself. The one plus is that this place is pretty big! I was expecting that given how historic is it that it would be packed, even on a Tuesday night, but it was pretty empty. While it's big though, the seating areas are very strangely connected.

972,Mike T.,1,3,"Our party of 5 split a full pizza for about $35-$40.  We put half margaritas pizza & half white-sauce pizza (added sausage & red peppers).  We came around 5PM on a Saturday and had a 30 min wait.The pizza bread has great texture.  It's got a nice crunch to it. Margarita pizza - average 3/5The margarita pizza was decent but wasn't anything special.  It was also lacking in flavor; I wish it had more toppings or something.  I think we should've gotten an entire white-sauce pizza instead.White-sauce pizza, added sausage & red peppers - 3.5/5I enjoyed the white sauce pizza 10x more than the margarita.  The sausages were pretty good and the red peppers had a nice touch.  Order this instead of the Margarita pizza.TIPS:-Cash only-Inside surprisingly big!",6/12/2014,387,817,2846,pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg

The gangster booths give it a Goodfella vibe but it also tasted like it was made by someone other than a pizza master. The sauce was overspiced and I felt that they didn't give us enough cheese. I'm not sure if they wanted us to savor the crust by skimping on the cheese or what, but that too wasn't anything memorable.Oh Food Network I have stopped believing in you like I stopped believing in Santa as a child.",12/25/2013,2281,1366,1659,ZMocFA2lNMJeiKjguUKu7g

It pairs well with the clams and gives it that nice citrusy zing to compliment. The whole pie was more than enough and we had at least a slice leftover for each of us, which we saved for a late afternoon snack.It seems like most folks compare it with Grimaldi's and let's just say after trying Lombardi's, Team Lombardi's all the way!",11/19/2015,141,230,1006,2vG0pUMQhaOky6R_l-cNQQ

I liked that it did not have a cream/cheese base, which often makes the pizza really greasy and cloying. Instead, the pie only had olive oil and some herbs sprinkled all over, and I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. My only complaint is the price - at $35 per pizza before tax, it was really expensive and not exactly good value for money. That said, one pays for the ambience and history of America's first pizzeria...",5/17/2017,136,83,148,21Z8TTHtYInXnmXfsCHviQ

I was excited that we only had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated for this NYC Mecca for pizza lovers. Pies are pricey, service was lacking as was the flavor in the sauce. My high expectations were not met with the first, second, or third bites. Pretty disappointing for a foodie.  The original margherita pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage is my favorite, anywhere else, not here. It just didn't do it for me. I'll skip the hassle of getting to Lombarti's next time I'm in town. We honestly had a better pie at a random mom and pop shop on our last trip to the city.

983,Tammie K.,1,4,"Having spent a few years living in New Haven, CT, I've had my fair share of amazing pizza. Ever since moving to NYC, I've never quite found my new favorite pizza spot. I think Lombardi's Pizza might be it though! I stopped by on a Friday afternoon with my friend visiting from SF, fully expecting this spot to be another overhyped tourist spot with a 2 hour waiting time. To my surprise, we only had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated. My friend and I shared ""Our Famous Clam"" pie. It was delicious and reminiscent of the white clam pies I've had back in CT. What I was most impressed with was how jam-packed with clams it was. This place is definitely not stingy when it comes to toppings. While eating, I saw a few other tables with the Margherita (which also looked amazing). My only complaint is that the pizzas are a bit pricey and the spot is cash only.",12/4/2015,320,181,140,PcJhUs8yNazC9vGJUuJi-A

985,Rona L.,1,5,"I don't know how you Atkins dieters do it.  I'm a huge carbovore -- I love pizza, breads, pasta, etc. so this was our first stop after landing in NYC.  There are two dining areas, separated by a short walk through the kitchen.  The first area was full, so we were ushered into the back room, where we had the place to ourselves (for a good five minutes before it was packed).  We ordered their Original Pizza with mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil.  When you have perfection, you don't need to cover things up with tons of toppings.  Fresh, simple ingredients are all  you need, and Lombardi's is a great example of that.  The godfather and original NY pizza, it had an extremely thin, chewy crust, that held well and didn't flop, the mozzarella was amazing, the sauce had a great acidity, and the hints of basil just took the pizza over the top.  Lombardi's Pizza is the epitome of NY pizza and everything I thought it would be.  The history, the brick building, the thin crust and delicious toppings.  This was the perfect way to start off our trip.*Tip: Cash only.",11/27/2013,241,669,2944,A8BMl32898Uqryd1MjMS9A
986,Zander M.,0,4,The pizza at Lombardi's is very well made. The ratio between cheese and sauce.

I think pizza is a personal thing and my favorite could be your worst and vice versa. Now, with that said, believe the hype that surrounds Lombardi's. Lombardi's pizza has a perfectly thin crust that is crispy on the exterior and chewy on the interior; well-balanced sauce; and generous toppings. I made a mistake by opting for meatballs because I found the meatballs to be a tad stale-tasting, so I would suggest crumbled Italian sausage instead if you're a carnivore. Prices are a tad steep, but that's predictable for a NYC pizzeria that boasts about being the first establishment, ever, of its kind. This pizza tastes excellent the morning after as well. Just saying. I'll be back.",1/6/2014,888,344,1166,9t42QXISjlnNaoeGvev6FA

The pizza itself was thin (good), the sauce (appropriate amount), the cheese (left a lot to be desired as weird thing sort of cheese slices are not my preference), and the crust chewy and VERY salty. Unfortunately, for this pizza lover Lombardi's missed the mark.

991,Ted C.,1,1,"I'm not a fan of NY style pizza and since my friend wanted to try the flat, NY style that I've come to think as just 'meh,' I needed a good representative of it so that I didn't throw the results.Lombardi's was nearby and with it being the 'first' pizzeria why not? We waited for a little bit at the bar with some obnoxious people who wouldn't move despite the fact that they were closing their tabs. We got called and they 'offered to take our drinks' which was super confusing at first but we were seated in the other area that required us to walk out and into another door which meant we couldn't carry open containers of alcohol. We sat down, ordered the large cheese-since NY style seems like it's a plain cheese slice. When the pizza came, my friend said he was from out of town and if this was pizza that was typical of NY style. Despite the high pedigree I thought it was just okay pizza, nothing too extraordinary but decent.I'm awarding 1 star because with a large cheese and a soda they charged us 30 bucks and some change, which was about 10 bucks over the total. We flagged our waitress down and she said ""No, it was the right price."" When we asked to see the menu to double check the numbers she went to 'check' on our bill again and said it was 20 and some change handed us our correct change and then walked away without any apology.Is this how staff treat people who they think are tourists or visitors? If so, I would stay away. Seriously, why bother with the wait when all you're going to do is end up getting screwed over by servers?",12/1/2013,403,1767,1895,TylOr9YYTV3znqIvH7kdmQ

Isn't that so selfish?Anyway, my only regret is that we didn't order extra mozzarella. Shoot. That mozzarella cheese had something done to it by angels. It was so effing good!

This was my first time eating clam pizza and I must say I was very impressed.I've been to Grimaldi's too and I think Grimaldi's is slightly better than Lombardi.

What we got was no where near worth what we spent... the calzone crust was good, but not spectacular. The sauce was tasty, but nothing to write home about. The pepperoni was pretty good.

1004,Marissa S.,1,4,"When I think of Lombardi's, I think of their clam pie.Expecting a long wait during peak hours, I took the fam here mid-afternoon on a weekday to secure a table right away. Sure enough, we got seated as soon as we arrived. It didn't take long for us to decide what to get but right when I said ""clam pie"", our server just burst my bubble and said they were out of clams for the day. Major bummer! I wasn't eating at Lombardi's without getting one so we packed up and left. Came back about the same time the next day and made sure they had clams before getting on the subway. It was a Friday and the main restaurant was full. The receptionist led the way for us next door which was some sort of an extension of the restaurant. We were the first patrons there and seconds later, more groups came trickling in. It was more spacious than the other side so I'm glad we got seated there. As for the food, we obviously got the clam pie and nothing else. Imagine generous portions of clams atop a NY thin crust pizza the Lombardi way. I loved how the dough was chewy and not tough. Most thin crusts tend to be painful in your mouth when you chew onto them but this had a really pleasant texture. The clams were fresh and chewy as well. No tomato sauce on this pie, just clams, cheese, and some herbs which I think is cilantro? Not sure. It only comes in one size which is 14"" for $29. It was more than enough for our party of 3 but then again we were there for a mid afternoon snack only. If that was dinner or lunch, another order of pizza would probably be appropriate. Oh and don't forget to squeeze some lemon juice onto your pie before getting a bite. It adds a wonderful touch!  Service was nothing but exemplary. Very attentive and friendly. Water refills were consistent. They were even kind enough to let me charge my cellphone while we were eating. Grazie!  If you're in town for a visit, Lombardi's is not one to be missed.

It's the first pizza place in America so we had to try it of course. We had a sausage and mushroom pizza and it was very good. If we had this pizza at home it would be amazing. Having this pizza in NYC when we had so many others to sample it doesn't rate as high. Although they get extra points for being open during the snow storm while so many others weren't.

We ordered a large pie with prosciutto and arugula and honestly, it was just tasteless. It was a thin crust pie, with barely any cheese, some prosciutto and arugula thrown on top. It was over priced. Toppings are $5-6 a piece. It's cash only which is annoying because in this day and age, come on, really??!!  The waitress should've mentioned that one pie would not be enough for four people.

I had to check it out for myself and see if it was worthy of all the accolades it has received. SETTING: Very convenient. Close to major Subway and bus routes. The decor is exactly what you think of when you think of a traditional New York pizzeria; checkered red table cloths, dim lighting & table seats, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were playing in the background. It was old school and I liked it! The restaurant is surprisingly large; you discover that if you're seated anywhere other than the front of the restaurant. SERVICE: We only waited 5 minutes for a table, which was nice. Our server was great! He was attentive, knowledgable and personable. Our food came out quickly. No complaints with the service. *CASH ONLY* They do have an ATM Machine in the restaurant. FOOD: We ordered the bruschetta and the Margherita Pizza. *Bruschetta: very good. The tomatoes were fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly. I recommend it. *Margherita Pizza: We ordered a small, which is 6 slices. The crust was thin, the tomato sauce tangy with melted mozzarella and basil topped on the pizza. It was ok. It wasn't mind blowing pizza but wasn't bad. OVERALL: This restaurant has a large amount of historical value. That alone is worth the visit. I will return to try other menu items and I recommend any food enthusiast to do the same!",7/25/2018,245,179,297,9ci5zFEVDJdzqHPZi_mtWg
1018,Sayeh Z.,0,5,Words will not do justice to the journey I embarked on while eating Lombardi's pizza. Perfection. Don't believe me? Think I'm exaggerating? Go try and take a look around at the people's faces with each bite. We all basically took a trip to heaven. We ordered a side salad which was unimpressive so don't expect much from that. Other downside was it was a bit pricey but honestly worth it for me to experience the first pizza place in the US. You will not be disappointed with the main course. I think I'll move to New York now...,8/19/2015,269,78,207,1kdr8S6wJ6hcPWcbzFo2Ew
1019,Alex L.,0,4,"Lombardi's Pizza is known as the first pizzeria in America having opened it's doors in 1905. As such, it's a popular tourist destination for out-of-towners.Lombardi's is small and quaint, fostering an old fashioned Italian eatery look and fits right in with the Little Italy neighborhood it's located in.The service is great and the food is fantastic.However I would caution those who have found Lombardi's on the Best of NY Pizza lists. First, Lombardi's doesn't sell by the slice. Secondly, their basic pizza is served margherita style. Finally, while the pizza is very good, I find that it doesn't compare to such NYC stalwarts as Original Ray's or Joe's in the Village.And being a tourist destination in NYC means you're going to pay for the privilege ... $30 for a one topping small pie (ouch).All in all definitely worth the stop.",9/22/2015,34,131,0,Bts2UL_rhU0kyX1wKHsh5w

1026,Jessica L.,1,3,"New York City is known for it's pizza and I was told that Lombardi's was a must! According to the lights inside the restaurant, it was the first in the city - we just had to try it. Located on the outskirts of SoHo it was surrounded by cutesy boutiques and small eateries. I've walked past it before seeing people lining up outside the restaurant. We stopped here for an early Valentine's dinner, thankfully missing the crowds. The staff was very attentive and we were seated immediately. Like every other restaurant in the city, the interior was jammed packed squeezing in as many tables and chairs as possible. The walls were covered with autographed photographs of famous people who had dined here before. As ordered appetizer we had ""grandma's meatballs"" so we could mull over the many option of toppings that were available. Before we knew it our appetizer had arrived. The dish included 2 tennis ball sized meatballs covered in marinara sauce with parmesan shavings. The meatballs were ok, nothing too special. However the dish was a bit on the salty side. We ordered a margarita pizza and added sweet italian sausage, meatballs and wild mushrooms. I must say I was impressed when the pizza came out, the small pizza was more than enough for my boyfriend and I. As for the toppings they definitely did not skimp on them, and every piece was generously covered. The tomato sauce they used was different it didn't taste heavy like other sauces and they didn't go overboard with that and the cheese. The fresh torn basil added a delicious and subtle twist to the dish. Perhaps this place was too talked up, it was good but there are better pizza joints out there and for a lot cheaper.. 50 bucks for a few slices of pizza and meatballs is a bit much. I appreciate the great service that we were given. Everyone was so friendly and our food arrived quickly and was piping hot. Just a note, this place is cash only but they do have an ATM.",1/20/2018,724,329,816,JCxqmnSKTnHprmsYKoe1ow

The only issue I take is the wait time!  But that comes with being such a great place.  It's worth the wait.",12/13/2016,1969,278,96,2glb_2ZPr6PVGFbfgXTFDA

Given the volume they serve, this is not only inadequate but also inconvenient. I was mindfully observing the restroom line during my dining experience and was only able to get in and out after waiting 15 minutes.- Cash only. Enough said.

The service was awful, the waiter asked us what we wanted right after we received the menus so we asked him for a minute and he returned 20 minutes later. The pizza came fairly fast but the waiter didn't visit us once until we had to get up and look for him to get the check.

1042,Chloe T.,0,5,"People call it overrated, but I consider this to be the BEST pizza in NYC for a few reasons. The crust isn't too thin like a cracker, nor is it too thick and doughy. It actually stays crispy after sitting for a bit, unlike many other places that go soft after five minutes. There is minimal grease (it will vary depending on the toppings of course) but the Margarita pizza has very little if any. This is something I find unique to Lombardi's pizza. Even the calzone doesn't ooze grease (or water!). The tomato sauce isn't watery at all all, which can ruin a pizza by making it turn soggy. It isn't dried out either, I'm not sure how they do it! The amount of cheese is perfect, not too overwhelming. You must try the ricotta as a topping, it is perfectly creamy and light.

1066,Sergio G.,0,4,"One of many NYC pizzas we tried while on vacation and we were not disappointed! Order was ready very quickly and location is easy to find. The pizza was great, one of my favorites of all the ones we tried while visiting. The staff is very friendly when we went to go pick up our order to go. We placed it online and staff called to make sure we had something right. They care to make sure order is made right. Overall very pleased with visit!",6/1/2018,0,10,0,VzDVfIwSIXJE6AVXbj6SBQ
1067,Joyce Z.,1,4,"3.5 StarsThe reviews kinda over hyped this place for me. The pizza was definitely delicious, but I'm not sure if it was mind blowing different. I've lots of other pizza that is definitely comparable. This is a super touristy spot and there will always be a wait to get seated.We ordered a small pizza with sauteed garlic spinach, sliced tomatoes, and pepperoni. A small pizza (6 slices) can feed 2 people and costs $17.50 plus $3 or $4 per topping. The total came out to be about $30. Kinda pricey for a small pizza! Doesn't really help that this is cash only too.However I do have to admit it tasted good. They did a good job of keeping the crust dry and crispy. I hate soggy pizza crust! Also, the pepperonis were the legit kind - the small half sphere ones. Not sure if I would be dying to eat here again the next time I go to New York though.",4/3/2014,572,259,2828,Ry1Rctmgp2jfBxtmc0NQyg
1068,Gina P.,0,2,"To make it very clear, I am not really a pizza person. Pizza has to be exceptional for me to like it, but this place really didn't impress me. First off, we waited for about an hour to get inside and so we already had high expectations since it seemed like this was a popular pizza joint. Once we got inside, we ordered the margarita pizza and another pizza with pepperoni and sausage. I thought they were really sub-par and the margarita pizza wasn't as good as the hype. The crust was burnt so that was a major disappointment. I don't like burnt crust. But I'll be very mindful and say that the restaurant did provide the Italian restaurant feel, as many other reviewers have shared. It's also cash only, so stop by a bank before you head there. There's an ATM in the restaurant, but most likely will have some percentage charge, so just be prepared beforehand.",7/23/2016,218,40,71,MmtDlVooH64Pb21BHO8asQ
1069,Brian L.,0,3,"I know a lot of New Yorkers believe this is New York's best pizza, but we were completely underwhelmed. The pizza did not taste very good, and neither did the bruschetta. Service and atmosphere were nice though. Lombardi's claims to be the first pizzeria in America, making it a pretty significant place. The walls, like other New York institution like Katz's Deli, are adorned with photos taken over the years of celebrities that decided to stop by. In terms of pizza options, there isn't a whole lot of experimenting here. You can get pizza with sauce or without (white), and they have a potpourri of toppings you can throw on for extra. No daring pizza concepts here, Lombardi's is trapped in its old ways. The bruschetta was giant, fat pieces of bread that weren't toasted enough, topped with tons of fairly unflavorful tomatoes. Overall, this seemed like a place to stumble into as a tourist to experience ""real New York pizza,"" but is not a place I would frequent if I lived in the Big Apple.",6/10/2015,581,233,662,i5Ssj6oUIQtq8-uEcpLvDw

How come my people (the italian's) are the only one's still doing the cash only scam? OK you guess. And the fact we only wanted water to drink means we get tiny plastic cups. And paper plates too? Just seems a bit odd but maybe that's part of the experience. But nonetheless the pizza is delicious. The ""customer experience"" all feels a bit odd.

1075,Sharon C.,0,1,This is the worst pizza and Italian restaurant I have ever visited or had delivery from. Every time we have ordered food the order has been stacked on top of each other and juice from our entree dripping all over by the time it arrived at my home. We spoke to the owners and got a discount for our order to try again. Same thing. Missing food. Many months have passed and our daughter was visiting so we decided to give them another try. They are in our neighborhood and we try to give businesses close to us preference. What a mistake. We ordered food to be delivered and again our order was wrong. We tried to fix this on the phone with management but the outcome was John the manager called the local police and said we threatened him. The police called our home and when I spoke with the officer and I said my husband was unavailable he said I told him he wasn't here. He told me I lied to him. It took my husband getting out of the shower before the officer would believe us. I will never step foot or order from these unprofessional ill equipped people again.,6/25/2018,0,2,1,sx452nIWpRLVxU74hEyjrg
1076,Bao-Yen T.,0,4,"I am a pizza lover. Visiting New York, I wanted to try the first pizzeria in America. This place is a tourist trap but it really does live up to it's reputation. From the ambiance, decor and service, this is a genuine New York style pizza joint. One of the best pizzas I've had!PROS:Service: The host was very cheerful. Our waitress was also friendly and accommodating, she had great advice and suggestions upon ordering. Ambiance: Everything was pretty classic from the staff, decor to the food. The tables are covered with plaid table cloth. The walls are covered with different paintings. The decor definitely gave this establishment an authentic Italian style eatery. Food: The pizzas are delicious! Together, there were five of us that shared two large pizzas. The first was the traditional white pizza, the second was half margherita and half margherita with pepperoni. The pizzas are cooked in their original brick ovens so the crust is amazing! It's not too doughy and rather thin. Crispy of the outside but soft on the inside with a nice chew. The pizza remained crispy throughout our dining experience. The margherita pizza was distinctive and delightful. The tomato sauce was rich and tangy with a hint of sweetness. The mozzarella was amazing fresh, smooth and pulled apart easily during each bite. The basil added a nice kick to the flavors. The pizza was covered in a good amount of sauce without soaking through the dough. The white pizza had no sauce but used olive oil as a base. Covered with three different kinds of cheese (mozzarella, ricotta, grated romano cheese), it really was a cheesy heaven. I am not a huge fan of ricotta but it had a good amount of chunks without it overpowering the rest of the cheeses. Both pizzas were neither greasy or doughy. CONS:Food: The only downside was that there was a lack of the tiny pepperoni. Price: It's rather pricey for pizza. $24 for a large with $4-$5 for each additional toppings. Space: The building seems rather old and somewhat runned down. There are a lot of different dinning rooms in the restaurants, all are very small. Lots of foot traffic with the amount of customers that they get. Tips: Cash only. ATM available on site. Expect a wait time!",5/20/2015,568,157,820,l6Z76oifiTSp4zNb4o91TA

1078,Tracy K.,1,5,"Lombardi's is one more reason New York is the greatest city in the world.

A few stores down the block now, it is still the same company and has it's own original New York style. firstpizza.com. How friendly are New Yorker's?  Well I was in the city on serious business, taking my beloved mom to her annual check up with her specialists... with time to kill and alot on my mind, I was cruising around the city while waiting...   ooops... yes officer, won't drive the bus lane again, and my cell phone.. what cell phone!  hmm seat belt.. oh that?  Gave me a break only a seatbelt and apologized.... sweet! so only $130 fee for being an idiot tourist.... thank you!  ok... I put the cell on speaker if another call, and went to check out the food scene....Pulling up to Lombardi's there was no parking anywhere, had my quota of trouble for the day...... but had to have this pizza, meanwhile mom is about to call any second way uptown ....   so like a perplexed stalker.. I simply had my window down and was looking in...............  ""You got to park and go in, back up and park there"".. said some nice guy.. There? thats not a spot.... ""Just park and run in!""  hmm  I would if I didnt just get this ticket...... ""Ok""..  Why would  you want to go place my order for a slice.. wait its a whole pie only right... ok here's a $20.. ???  Looks around busy but wanting to truly help out... and nodds.. takes off..... comes back... says ""stay here they will bring it out"".. points to the window at some sweet spanish guy who is waving from inside.... Hey!!!!!!!!!!! yay!! ok.. thank you thank you!!and he took off.... lol.... out came my pizza, ""no no photos"" uhm.. yeah photos you'll be on Yelp tomorrow.. lol   Thank you!    Rolled my car to the corner looking inside at the odd pizza....  some young woman runs out and puts a few bucks in my car window on the seat... and says your change!!  and runs off  ??  That was my hero's tip.. obviously didn't take a tip.

Not really surprised me, it's never been the best however it was always good at least.The sauce was metallic, no idea how the crust was cold yet burnt and the most annoying part is there was almost no cheese on the pie.Best part?  30 Dollars.  I know it's for tourists, but what an insane ripoff.....I could have stomached the price if it was still good....but this place has obviously dropped any quality it once stood for and is going for 100% profit due to tourist ignorance.",10/29/2017,2,97,0,fqvXExoKt-lpGPpDNg2Rag

If I'm going to eat pizza off a paper plate, I shouldn't pay a premium for it.This place is cashing in on its touristy status.

1088,Greg V.,0,1,"Tired of being disappointed. Pizza is not even bothered to pretend to have the care to be cooked well anymore. They've created a basement ""dining room"" to squeeze more customers through. It is really kind of sad in the basement. A converted store room with exposed pipes, vents and an effort at some wine storage to make it seem like its a restaurant. They shouldn't have added these tables for regular diners, maybe as a banquet room. Cramming too many diners at small tables even for New York standards. They are at the point now where they are simply pushing as many customers through as possible and cashing in on the old name and reputation. When you obviously show no respect for your customer, that's when it's over. If you're going here because it's the ""first"" pizza place in America and you want to share this experience for the first time with a friend or special someone else, be warned that now is the time to stop going.

He menjat (com tothom) pizzes, pizzes i més pizzes en un munt de llocs diferents així que de vegades penses que una pizza ja no et pot sorprendre en cap aspecte.Certament aquesta pizzeria no suposa cap innovació dins del món de la pizza tradicional però si vaig quedar sorprès per un parell d'aspectes: per una banda la presència d'ingredients amb molt bon sabor (coses tant senzilles com la salsa de tomàquet, l'alfàbrega fresca o les mandonguilles tenien molt bon gust!) i per l'altre una massa molt molt fina que a pesar de suportar el ""pes"" de la salsa de tomàquet la resta d'ingredients es mantenia perfectament torrada (ni estovada ni tova...). En conjunt tens ls sensació d'estar menjant una pizza sana (tot el que una pizza permet) i de qüalitat (molt ""poc americana"" en aquest sentit). Si a tot això hi sumes el fet de tractar-se la primera pizzeria dels EUA (es diu aviat!) la cosa guanya força encant.Hi tornaria sense cap mena de dubte.

We settled on Lombardi's as a destination prior to a day of exploring SoHo, Little Italy and Greenwich Village, but we would have been just as well of grabbing a cheap slice at one of the dozens of other places in south Manhattan. We paid $43 for a small pizza and Caesar salad, and while the food was good, we (perhaps foolishly) expected more value for that price. Fountain drinks were $3 with no refills and there was no bread on the table. There were paper plates and plastic cups. The atmosphere was very touristy and while the wait staff were friendly, it felt like they wanted you in and out to make room for more customers. The serving sizes were very good - we shared a ""small"" pizza and had enough to share and take leftovers with us.

I like the service was right on point and bartenders so friendly.To be honest I was a little bit upset by the huge line waiting for table. But I didn't give up because I wasn't the only one waiting, there were about 10 people after me and they were very happy waiting. So I decided to stay to figure out myself why this pizzeria has such an amazing reputation. I loved the pizza. Believe it or not I went by myself and since I couldn't order a slice of pizza I ordered a whole pizza and almost ate it all. I will definitely come back",2/24/2016,118,9,16,bSdh3OuDW_9eTUjO39OgMQ

1109,Charles H.,0,1,"OK, I don't get what all the fuss is about. Waitstaff was brusque (took away appetizer plates which still had food on them without asking, dropped off drinks without saying anything, never once checked to see how things were). Got the Grandma Grace's meatballs. Two big pork/beef meatballs (3"", $11) with a sweet sauce. No searing of the meat - tasted like boiled basic meatballs. Also got the small margherita pizza  ($22 for 14""). Sauce was fresh but basic, and mozzarella was good, but the dough had an overworked texture. Also just a few tiny pieces of basil on top, not enough to influence the flavor. Served on paper plates with paper napkins. And had to use the same paper plates we used for the appetizer for the pizza as well.Definitely not worth it, unless you want the satisfaction of saying you ate at the oldest pizza place or want to taste what a coal oven pizza is like (wood fired beats it by a mile).",6/20/2016,0,11,0,vRx1A1bjfLobz46NEV9ZLg

1111,Jessica C.,1,4,"USA's first pizzeria..had to give it a shot! Fun fact! A tour guide told us that the restaurant did close down for a few years then the same family reopened it once Little Italy boomed. The menu is small. I honestly only looked at the pizza and salad options so I cannot comment on the other food. There were only two salad options; a house salad and a ceasar salad. My friend and I chose the ceasar salad and for $9.50 the salad was rather small but it is NYC so I'll let that go. We also ordered a small Margherita pizza, a classic. The salad came out quickly and within 10 minutes the pizza was served. The pizza was good with a medium/thin and crispy crust. The mozzarella cheese was fresh and the tomato sauce was great. We paired our pizza and salad with a classic red Montepulciano wine. There was garlic and red pepper flakes at the table but the pizza had enough flavor that I didn't think the extra spices were necessary. The decor of Lombardi's looks like a typical Italian restaurant taken from any movie. It has the cliche red and white checkered table cloths, Frank Sinatra music playing and framed pictures of celebrities dining at the establishment. I would visit Lombarid's again. Our dinner total came to about $45 which is not a bad price for eating in NYC. The restaurant is cash only so be prepared. If you are not prepared, there is an ATM inside the restaurant.",11/8/2013,317,415,710,lABhRt6E1lAvG68kqQZMow

They use chunks of mozzarella instead of covering the whole pie in cheese (Neopolitan style). Not exactly what I picture when I think of NY style pizza. The plain margherita pizza is pretty good by itself but you can add any toppings you like but prepare to pay more.It's worth trying at least once but prolly won't come back because of the long wait for a table. The place is CASH ONLY. Maybe they're trying to stay true to their historical claim (since 1905!) by refusing to use credit card machines..",1/1/2014,200,275,864,hjySa6aCl140u6vY_2RGrw

We were seated within five minutes with a menu in front of us. I have no preference when it comes to pizza (working at a pizzeria and eating all the pizza I want for five years kind of killed it), so the boyfriend customized it to his liking. We got the cheese pizza with the mushrooms, pepperoni, and sausages. We also ordered a Caesar salad which was more than enough to share between the two of us. Service was quick as well for it being dinner time. Oh yeah! I had the raspberry iced tea, thinking it would be Brisk or whatever, but it wasn't! It was actually pretty good and had more of the tea taste to it!My friends arrived later on and ordered the pizza with the white sauce.

First off, the marinara sauce on that thing had to be the best, and I mean BEST, freshest, marinara sauce I have ever consumed. Words cannot explain how tasty the sauce was, I wanted more! And this is coming from someone who doesn't care for tomato products. In fact, I grew up hating tomatoes so imagine how good it must've been if I wanted to bathe in the damn thing!Sauce, thin crisp crust, cheese, and basil.

But there was nothing special for me. Between the large Margarita pizza and the medium vegetable mushroom and sausage pizza they satisfied my hunger but not a hearty delicious craving for pizza.I guess it all comes down to preference of how you like your pizza.

The staff was completely inattentive, and uninterested in serving you. As for the menu, everything says No, No, No, No. Like for example, No free refills when the soda is $3 I believe... Come on, don't be a cheap a$$. It turns you away and makes you think negatively about the store. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone visiting; waste of time and money.

1122,Laura O.,1,4,"Stopped in at what is apparently the ""first pizzeria in America"" randomly this Sunday afternoon after learning another spot had a 2+ hour wait. We did try calling before heading to Lombardi's and the person on the phone couldn't tell us how long the wait would be because he was in the kitchen and ""didn't know what was going on out there"". He said he thought there was a wait, but it might not be very long, but he really couldn't due to his being in the kitchen and all. So he couldn't just ask someone? I'd imagine that's the kind of thing people call about a lot...Anyway, we made the journey over, and the wait ended up being like 15 minutes, which was quite reasonable. Once seated, I started off with a raspberry Italian soda, which was topped with whipped cream-- delicious and refreshing. We ordered their basic margherita (fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, topped with romano and fresh basi) and added mushrooms. The pizza is undoubtedly top notch - good crust from a coal-fired oven, tangy sauce, delicious basil, fresh mushrooms, which were my favorite - but I thought some improvements could be made. The sauce was perhaps a smidge too tart, and I could've used some more basil. Still, as far as I can tell, Lombardi's more than holds its own with New York's best pizzerias.",3/15/2015,349,553,36,WQnfyig39Xg5ni98ci-VBw

It was a place where locals and tourist alike could have a great pizza. Fast forward to yesterday, I went there for the first time in month. It seems they have gone in full ""tourist trap"" mode. I'm talking about time square level tourist trap. They raised the prices and made the regular size pizza much smaller. So much so I was a hungry when we were done. Instead of regular plates they give you these cheap paper plates that barely hold the pizza. Instead of glass (or plastic!) cups they give these flimsy solo cups.

1138,Dave G.,0,5,"It's been 6 years since I first went to Lombardi's and did a taste test between the Original Grimaldi's and Lombardi's.  Lombardi's slightly won (you can read my previous review as to why).  I've since been to Di Fara's and had the master himself make me an amazing pie.  I still think Lombardi's is the champion.  I'm sure there are others to try, and try them I shall, but every Lombardi's pizza I've had since day one has lived up to it's predecessor.On this last trip, I actually dared to try a few other things.  Well actually I had a few other people with me who were willing to over order.  We of course got an Original Margherita pizza.  We got it with Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, and Roasted Red Peppers.  The sausage here is amazing, so don't get a pizza without it.  The sausage is pre-cooked, so it can be sliced like a deli meat, nice and thin.  The marinated red peppers are also roasted in their coal ovens prior to being put on the pie.  I do love them, but I'm starting to think that they are the reason their Margherita pie gets a little soggy.  Truth is, I'm ok with that.  It tastes so good, I don't mind to eat it with a knife and fork.  But not soggy would be even better.  Next time I'll hold off on the peppers and see if that helps. yelp.com/biz_photos/lomb…Our 2nd pizza was a White Pizza.  Mozzarella, ricotta, romano, oregano, basil, black pepper.  Rather than red sauce, garlic infused oil is spread on the pie before all the cheesy goodness goes on.  While, you must get a traditional Margherita pizza if it's your first time here, this may be the best white pizza I've had.  The ricotta cheese was piped on like a cake frosting in 2 inch star shapes.  This had the advantage of getting just a little crisped along the edges under the super hot oven, like a mashed potato on a shepherds pie.  The ricotta cheese had a nice nutmeg flavor to it, which really worked.  This pizza has a much thicker layer of mozzarella cheese than it's Margherita counter part. The only topping we added was sausage.  Even though it's a thin crust, it's a pretty heavy pie with all that cheese.  yelp.com/biz_photos/lomb…We also tried an excellent calzone.  Perhaps this wasn't necessary as it was pretty close to a white pizza all rolled up.  Stuffed with ricotta & mozzarella, we added sausage and roasted red peppers.  We got some red sauce on the side to splash around.  This was also a good thing to go with some of the white pizza as well. yelp.com/biz_photos/lomb…What really separates Lombardi's from every where else for me is the crust.  Their crust has so much character to it.  The depth of flavor is outstanding.  It's like a fine ciabatta bread rather than a traditional pizza crust.  I love how it holds in the smokey flavor from their charcoal oven, but never tastes burnt.  The texture is excellent and has a nice chew to it.  I've never had to wait in long lines here, since I get here right when they open or slightly off hours.  In fact I was first in line on a Sunday for lunch and got here before the mozzarella did.  If I ever wanted to steal a truck this would be it. yelp.com/biz_photos/lomb…***CASH ONLY*** and considering that your pizza can add up to $50 if you get a bunch of toppings on it, make sure you have plenty of cash.  They do have an ATM on premises if you forget.",4/23/2016Updated review,507,495,1204,Bt6gmjnWHPERhiOTQOhuEA

1143,Dave H.,0,5,"After being regulars in the pre-Yelp, pre-having-kids-and-moving-to-North-Carolina days, the wife and I brought the family here while revisiting the city so they could see what the first pizzeria in America was all about. So, first thing to know before you go: it's CASH ONLY. Why? You got me. Maybe they like the feel of fabric vs. plastic. Or maybe it's an IRS shell game. Or, maybe it's none of our business, capisce?Our wait at 4:30 on a Monday was long, around 45 minutes--much more than in days past. But considering everywhere we went in the city during Christmas week was more akin to a soccer riot than an actual retail/restaurant scene, I figured we were getting off easy. Tip: Once seated, take a minute or two and bask in the glory. Look around and soak in the history. Relish the ambiance. More importantly, giggle at your good fortune and smirk at the poor fools still standing around, waiting for tables & staring back at you with expectant glances and watering mouths. Quick like a bunny our waiter arrived, and without further adieu we placed our order--a classic margherita pizza with pepperoni. That's it and that's all. No need to mess up that vintage taste and presentation with too many toppings and CPK-style foolishness. Very soon our pie was delivered to the table, piping hot and bubbling.  Since their coal-fired oven heats up to 1000° plus, the pizzas cook in two or three minutes, so you're not made to wait and suffer any further. It looked almost too good to eat, but of course that didn't stop us. We dove in and relished what thousands and thousands of satisfied aficionados have enjoyed for more than a century...that perfectly thin, perfectly charred crust...the bright, ripe San Marzano tomato sauce...the fresh mozzarella cheese with fresh basil...honestly, it doesn't get any better than this. All too soon, it was over. But instead of feeling depressed, we did what any other pizza lovers would've done in the same situation: we ordered another one. And enjoyed it just as much as the first. After finishing the second round, we went around the table and talked about what made this pizza so great, and compared it to places we knew back home. Of course there was no comparison, and I was impressed to hear the kids take on the nuanced (and not so nuanced) differences between them. We paid the tab (in cash, remember?), and left with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction, already reminiscing of the great meal and planning to return again next time we're in town.",2/3/2015,15,5,2,wHgWXQj9BrDJQ2ShL2rIug

1149,Sarah P.,0,3,"Look at the 4000+ reviews! We're so hyped to try the famous New York Pizza at America's First Pizzeria but we're very disappointed. Their service sucks arse! If you ain't white be prepared to be seated in a tiny 2-seat tables down the basement. Food is quick cause we only ordered one small pie but the rest went down the drain. We wanted water with lemon and they forgot our lemon. We wanted our check and they took forever to respond. This is a historical tourist trap.So what if you're America's first? If your service ain't good your food ain't worth our money. I like their pizza but I have had better. If you wanted a restaurant atmosphere, go to Grimaldi's. There's one in Flatiron District. If you wanted pizza a la carte, go to Bleeker Street Pizza. They open late, too. Need I say more?",2/2/2015,201,155,7439,JHZZv7oUbH6DUvisJeWXZw

Not always the best barometer for quality, but certainly a great lightning rod for hype.I totally appreciate that back in pilgrim times, Lombardi's was the bees knees of pie this side of the New World. Of course, they were also the *only* bees knees....Like Alice Water's Chez Panisse, Lombardi's is an establishment whose glory days have passed. It set the bar once upon a time, but its contemporaries have happily come along and raised that bar. The Original Margherita that my friend and I shared was burnt. Its cheese was sparse, drowning in a sea of badly seasoned red sauce. Combined with the laughably rude service, this was one of the saddest pizza experiences I've ever had. If you must add it to your list of NY tourist traps to visit, make sure it's at the bottom.",2/7/2015,635,1622,28,s16-BUo-orUsELvMu5ocKg

The pizza here is quite pricey. A small margherita with one pepperoni topping comes out to 28 bucks. It's solid pizza with a very crunchy bread crust but I don't know if the hype met expectations.

The menu is extremely limited and they take ""cash"" only.  We also witnessed 2 Chinese ladies come in just after us for a table and they were told they didn't have any tables for 2.  They were arguing saying they called and were told they had tables and that they had walked a long way to get there. They left upset and said they would never come back.  Several other parties came in after them and were seated right away.  This was extremely disheartening.

I know you guys want to keep it old school, but how about updating the quality for some class? My friend and I were mostly left to our own most the of the meal and had to ask for water refills so I'm not sure, there are better places to go for pizza in NYC.

It's been well over a year that I visited Lombardi's and still have not reviewed it. While in New York this was one of my ""spots"" on my to do list.We went for lunch and got in right away. You could tell that everyone in New York wanted a taste of Lombardi's though. We were sat, ordered our drinks and food and had both pretty fast. I must admit that the pizza was DE.LI.CI.OUS! I  mean it was missing a little cheese but it was crusty, chewy and saucy all at the same time. Just the way I like it. We got the original Margherita style with half pepperoni. No need to ask, we scarfed it down. The pepperoni was small and spread all over, OMG, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. It was floppy yes, but I realized that's how New Yorkers make their pizza. Floppy. It was the perfect thin though. Service? Good, but it was lunch so I would hope it would be good.I will absolutely visit again when I'm in town which I'm hoping isn't far in my future. Gracias for a delicious experience Lombardi's.

1165,Klarissa L.,0,3,"My husband is really into Pizza, so we've tried over a dozen of the 'famous' / well known pizza places in New York, and to be honest, Lombardi's is our least favorite.  The overall space was much larger than I expected, there is a back room and the main room, however this place does still fill up with a line out the door still, even when it's 15 degrees outside.  The service was very good and staff was friendly, food came out fast.  To be clear, this place is great, just compared to some of the other AMAZING pizza places in New York, Lombardi's is mehh.We ordered half white and half margarita with sausage.  The Margarita was much better than the white, as I feel like the white lacked flavor.  Pizza definitely was not BAD, I just feel like there is so much pizza competition in New York and for the hype, price, wait and overall taste, you could easily go elsewhere.  Personally, I actually really like L'asso Pizza the street.  The pizza is AMAZING, beer and wine specials during the day are great and you get more for your $$ AND I actually like the pizza there more!  Another smaller not as 'famous' but GOOD pizza place is Rizzo's Fine Pizza in the Lower East Side.  I think in the city, Rizzo's is my husband and my favorite place for good pizza.  Outside the city is definitely Di Fara's, but that's an adventure in itself unless you get take out.Anyways, if someone wanted good New York pizza, I would recommend a lot of other places before Lombardi's.  I would not come back here again, but I give it 3 stars because it's not a bad establishment, there's just a lot to compare to.",2/20/2015,64,167,957,Hiz_ESG9ygDqNG6Q7cyzzQ

1167,Will S.,1,4,"The 1ST pizzeria in the US of A is Lombardi's.   That fact alone should get you to come visit and try this seriously scrummy pizza. Lombardi's pie is uniquely delicious, crusty in places, slightly charred in others.  I love love this pizza.  What make this pizza famous and sought after is because making a Lombardi comes from  traditions  straight from Naples and it's baked in coal fired ovens.  Some even say NYC water helps make this crust truly NY.  Pizza in Naples is usually wood fired and the heat so intense that there are regions in the pie that cook to a char leaving the center of the pie soft/moist.  Lombardi's on the other hand is slightly different, soft in the center, slightly charred and gradually chewy in the outer region of the pie.  This feature allows one to pick up a slice, fold it lengthwise and eat it from the center to end.    And the ingredients are genius:  mozzarella fior di latte, San Marzano (from Sicily) tomatoes and others mostly imported from Italia.What we had?First we had the white pizza, indescribably luscious melding of cheeses.   I could say this pie is clouds of cheese heaven on a plate.   No sauce just cheese.  Ooooooh yeah.  I have lactose intolerance with cheeses made in America but not Italian or Euro cheeses.  I can eat this and appreciate what I'm missing.  I started eating it with a fork and knife and found it to be a bit hard to cut toward the edge.  Quickly realized, NYC pizza, duh, you pick this sucker up, fold it and get busy.  Picked up the droopy cheese from the center and drooled.  Not content,  we ordered a second pizza; yep, the first one was so geniusly good, gluttony was the order of the night.    This time we got a margherita with fungi and pancetta. Seriously.   I was so into this gorgeous magnificence of red sauce, luscious cheese, salt from the pancetta and earth from the mushrooms cradled by a chewy crust.  Gaaaawd, so happy.   I was silent as I cruised through 2 slices.  I just appreciated that the charred crust complimented the S. Marzano tomatoes, the pancetta giving you that salt punch to contrast the sugar and tartness from the tomatoes, rounded out by a slightly bold pungent Chianti, which I ordered to drink with this pie.  My palate was so tingly,  I was nomming after.  My friends devoured the rest and we had none to take back to the hotel.  Beer with the white pizza and chianti for the fungi and pancetta margherita and life was good.NO dessert, too full, just more chianti and a coffee.   Zen gluttony!  But happy.Tip #1:  Cash only, cash only cash only.  There's an ATM.   Tip #2.  Don't let high Zagat ratings cloud your expectations here as some Yelpers have reported.  This is a different pizza.  Come here and decide whether you like it or not,  from what you've read from Yelpers and other sources.  Michelin stars or James Beard medals does not necessarily mean you will like the food.   Your palate will dictate what you like and not some Zagat or Michelin fogies who think they know what you should like.Visits:  1",12/2/2014,983,631,5852,_5ZU2jXJbffdKb7p1RvVfQ

1169,CHRISTINE Z.,1,3,"My friend and coworker informed me that Monday was National Pizza Day, so we immediately made our way to Lombardi's after a quick Yelp check for good pizza places. We even braved the cold for an additional 10 minutes to get to the right subway station. When we got there, it was around 6pm, and the restaurant was empty. That being said, it's a HUGE space. I've never seen so many tables so well hidden... You enter through a specified entrance (there's many windows/doors), and then the hostess will take you through the maze to your table. The decoration is casual, with red and white checkered tablecloths that seems to dominate Little Italy eateries. I had heard of this place's pizza from a couple different sources, but was still fairly clueless as to the history of the place. I knew that the outside facade included a painting of Mona Lisa eating pizza, which was pretty cool to me. But once we sat down, we knew right away we would get the margherita pizza. We opted for the small, which is just over $20. The 6 slices were huge--plenty for two people. Or, just right, really. Except for the price ($20 for a pie that's 70% tomato sauce was a little excessive), everything was good. The crust was perfectly thin, but not tooooo thin that it got soggy, the mozzarella slices were evenly distributed (but scarce), and the basil was fresh and tasty. Our server was very nice, and service was quick. The rest room was clean, and I could see how this would make for a nice place to go for some good pizza. I think I'll give it another go next time with a cheesier pie.",2/11/2015,73,292,35,EF_kHLeMImwGoMvxaqsD8Q

(i love cheese)the clam was also very good, but make sure you put that lemon juice on it, because without it, it's a little boring. the crusts were on point. Overall, I loved the pizza, but I can't give this a 5 because the price was pretty darn high for amount you get. I think if food is MIND BLOWINGLY AMAZING i can look over a high price, and don't get me wrong.. this pizza was really good!, but 30 bucks for a small clam pie? BRUH. service was kinda slow... like they expect you to take a while to pick what to order. or maybe they just want you to order more. hahathere are plenty of seats though. they have this whole back room that we had to get to by going through the kitchen. almost got lost on the way out!I'd def recommend this place but it's CASH ONLY!!!!!

Loaded with fresh ingredient flavor -especially the mozzarella. The salad was also flavorful and the Chianti was delicious. The ambiance is great, and you will certainly leave knowing what the owner looks like -there are self portraits everywhere. So, the two major reasons they don't get a 5star is service and price.

We decided not to have a big meal throughout the day so we can grub on our pizza!!! We arrived around 7/8pm and there was about a 20 minute wait. The place is very casual. While we were waiting we had a few beers by the bar and before we knew it, it was time. We were directed upstairs. I was surprised to see that there are so many seating areas because when you first walk in the place looks small. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (which I think no one does, total tourist move).

This place is very dear to our hearts.Recently disappointed with the downgrade to paper plates and and upgrade in prices- come on you can't do both! Increase the price and decrease the experience- I DONT THINK SO! It's a place we always spend a bit over $100 for two people (we get a pitcher of beer or a bottle of wine and apps Bc we want the full experience not just a pie- u can get a pie and not spend this much) so I really don't expect to be eating off of Dixie plates. I was really pissed. I was pissed for them Bc it cheapens how phenomenal it really is. The old school dishes were the best that kept the ""nonna's dinning room"" vibe going. Plastic cups?! I draw the line!!

The staff is polite and well organized, they let me know I had the option of carry out vs dining which I was in a rush to eat so carry out was a nice option.So I paid $23 for a small pepperoni pizza, pretty pricey but it's NYC and the founder father of American pizza. The crust is thin, not super crispy but it's good. The pepperoni are good and on the smaller side. The sauce has its own taste I'd say kind of tomatoey if that's a word in a good way. Not something you'd find in a store. The cheese is awesome, but it's margarita style do it's not a lot of cheese which I wish it was. Put it all together and boom there is the ""first pizza"" and it's pretty good.It's fun to try it once, it is a little different and does taste unique. Yes it is very hyped and don't think that will ever change.",12/27/2014,857,1146,1537,Ry2eEdDFbB3jCd-puLq0bg

1189,Aaron G.,0,4,"Came to Lombardi's with some friends from New Jersey as they recommended it. Been looking for some good pizza while in New York and was totally let down by Ray's famous and Joe's pizza in Times Square. Lombardi's is good but nothing I haven't had before. If this is one of New York's best then you can get the same thing at Grimaldi's in Las Vegas. Pizza is almost identical nevertheless, it was still good.",5/6/2018,0,33,0,3cmfoktSMvRykRxHXF1OUw
1190,Denise W.,0,4,"Cash only but they also have an ATM inside the restaurant. Classic New York coal oven pizza; Not Naples, not all that trendy stuff you can go elsewhere for. It's the way things were done over 100 years ago in America and hasn't really changed. While not my top favorite of the ""old guard"" group of historical NYC pizza legacy, there something to be said that Lombardi's taste the same since I was a kid, taste the same today, and every time I come here it's consistently good.$23 for a large basic marinara or white pie plus $3-5$ for each topping. $20 base price for a small. You can customize with only topping half a pie or have half white pie and half red pie as well. They also offer a clam pie.My current visit, I got a $23 large red pie with $4 Pancetta, $4 Pepperoni, and $3 Wild Mushrooms as my toppings. They slice their toppings as to get a char around the edges in the oven so I normally stay away from sausage as it is also thin cut and I prefer the sausage to be more just chunks out of the casing. The pepperoni is probably the best topping as the edges curl up nicely and gets the optimal effect in that oven. They really load on the toppings so definitely worth splurging on a few.The pizza had really good quality toppings. The sauce is a little thinner than I'd like and I prefer more fresh basil on my pies but overall a consistent, perfectly cooked pie every time. 7 minutes in that oven does wonders.Service is very nice and the waiter consistently checks up on his tables, refilling water when needed. This is the place to bring an out-of-towner for historical purposes and just the way they do things hasn't changed for so many years. I prefer sitting in the original more narrow side of the restaurant before they annexed the corner as it has a better rustic feel. It's part of its charm and nostalgia.",1/29/2015,110,182,1190,NzyxGo87GNxBv4JuUD_23w
1191,Joshua M.,1,3,"Disappointed the first pizzeria in the United States, because unfortunately it didn't amount up to anything special other than a general pizza place. I went with two friends on a Tuesday evening, and when we walked in the place was full. A host told him to follow us, and he led us with a lot of other people to a basement area with a few tables. It subtracted from the atmosphere of upstairs, so I feel like I didn't get the full experience of the place, but on the other hand, I felt like the basement was a little bit more of a private area of the place. We ordered a large cheese pizza and bruschetta as an appetizer. The bruschetta was good, but nothing special. The pizza was a decent size, but they make their pizza with a much higher marinara sauce ratio than to my liking. Their was very little cheese on the pizza, so it almost tasted like we ordered just a tomato pie. The crust was very thin and also extremely well done, burnt in some parts. While I was eating my slice of pizza, I saw something that didn't look like cheese, it was a piece of plastic. It looked like it came from one of the bags in the back, and it wasn't a big deal, but just another strike against an already mediocre place. The waitress was very friendly and brought our food out in a reasonable amount of time. I'd give a big thumbs up for the service aspect. Lombardi's is cash only, but they said they have an ATM outside. Everything here was really just average. I would have been much happier if this place was at a reasonable price, but even that was very high for a pizza pie. I could have gone to another place and gotten a better pizza for a cheaper price. With all of the selection in NYC, I probably won't be back here, but at least I got to say I was at the first pizzeria in the America.",8/25/2013,316,322,1126,Xstf9n7v8rSOryJAuY2S7Q

The place was crowded but the wait was only about 20-25 minutes and then we found ourselves seated in a small table in the cozy basement dining room. I started off with the house salad and I loved their house Italian dressing. We went for the classic pie and I was not disappointed. The sauce deliciously sweet, the mozzarella creamy and rich. The crust at Lombardi's is the thin, crist crust with a bit of char I've come to enjoy living in the New England area. The ingredients Lombardi's uses--especially the basil taste extremely fresh.

1196,Tiffany W.,0,2,"Underwhelmed. I came here with a friend and her mother who was visiting from another country. They wanted a NY pizza experience, so I turned to Yelp for suggestions. The reviews seemed mixed and varied, but it had a good overall rating so we decided to give it a try!At first, it was great. We got seated immediately even after no reservations. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. Our waiter didn't get us our waters until a good 10 minutes after, and this was after we bugged him and the busboys about it. Waiting for him to come around to take our order also took a while.My table of four shared a large pizza and a calzone with prosciutto. We got the pizza half white and half marinara, to try both and the marinara was way better. The ricotta swirls were torched on top and made for a pretty pizza but it wasn't very flavorful. The marinara brought a nice sweetness to the tongue, but the tough, dry crust was a rude awakening. The calzone was better. There is marinara to dip the dry dough in, which brings much-needed moisture and flavor to it. For the price point and the hype, we left disappointed. It was slightly embarrassing bringing a friend and her visiting mother here for NY pizza. Food and service were both mediocre.",3/26/2016,40,34,26,9Uhlk7y2e6iOQsdhwtmG_Q

The pizza was delicious. We also shared some salads and their meatballs - and all was fantastic food!It is NYC so the place is crowded.  It is hard to maneuver around.  And as long as you love everyone you're there with you're good because you will be sitting close!  The prices are reflective of NYC and the fact that it is kind of a tourist location.  It's worth it though!,5/22/2015,68,42,22,6iTs-yJXO-RxotJ_mu2nyQ

We saw a line-up spiralling out the door when we arrived Sunday evening, but we took it as a sign that spoke of the experience awaiting just inside.  Not 15 minutes later we were sitting at a cozy table for two in the centre. The atmosphere is cosy and inviting, with all the New York hustle! The servers and staff are efficient and you can tell they take pride in where they work The pizza. Oh, the pizza! We ordered a small traditional margherita and from the second it was placed at our table we were in heaven. Perfection. The crust was the right balance of thin crust crunch and soft doughy goodness.  The mozzarella cheese was smooth and clean without the grease and oils one might expect. With only minimal ingredients each of the six slices was full of flavour. We each had three pieces which left us feeling healthy and satiated.We left Lombardi's beyond satisfied that evening and promised ourselves we would return to New York again to experience all the flavours of this fantastic restaurant.

1208,Jon B.,1,3,"I was here late night on Valentines day with a big group. I was a bit excited to try this spot, based on all the Yelp reviews and the whole ""first coal-oven NYC pizza place"". I left finding the experience pleasant enough but not memorable.Our party of 7 was seated pretty easily when we were ready. They will let you sit without the entire party there as long as you are ordering (the birthday boy was running late). We ordered 1 White Pizza (mozzarella/ricotta) and 1 Original with meatballs.   We also added some bread sticks.The food arrives very fast, I will credit them for their swift service. Our waiter, was pretty honest in telling us that 2 pies would suit a party of 7 well. The slices although fairly large were thin, so factor that in. I think that a hungry guy could easily eat 3-4 of their slices. The breadsticks mixed with the marinera sauce were delicious. The white pizza slice I had was decent, but didn't blow me away. I enjoyed the Original with meatball a bit more although the cheese easily peeled off the crust.I also liked the bartender at the main bar when you walk in. Since we got there early and had to wait for our friend, he was very personable and poured a strong rum and coke.Overall, check it out at least once to say you've been.

Definitely a piece of history you WILL NOT want to miss.What was interesting was coming in on a Monday night, when the restaurant was apparently not too busy, perfect timing I guess! I've had other friends tell me their wait times were on the order of hours to be seated, but my buddy and I just strolled in and got seated downstairs immediately!As I was a first time New Yorker roaming the streets and checking all the recommendations of my fellow foodies, naturally I was full from all the street food and other delectable items from the NY food culture. We decided to just split a large Margherita with sauteed garlic spinach and sweet red peppers, simple and to the point. Best pizza choice I've ever made. Six slices, and as full as I was, I still made a point to eat as much of that pizza as I possibly could (which was conveniently three slices, leaving the other half for my friend).Marshall Eriksen's rendition of the bite of pizza comes to mind as I write this post:""Aww the crunch, and then marinara, that roiling lava of tomato and oregano; it overtakes you. I'm falling. And that's when she catches you. That chewy voluptuous mistress -- Mozzarella. Oven-kissed cheeks crackle with warmth in your mouth, cradling the sauce and the bread, letting you know from now on this is home. This pizza...

My mom, sister, and I all preferred the sausage and pepperoni pizza but my sister's friend liked the meatball pizza better. The pizza dough is thin and crunchy. I don't eat the crust on my pizza so I needed more pizza to fill me up. I think I had about 5 slices! I've never had an Italian Cream Soda so I didn't know what to expect. It's pretty and fun to drink. The soda isn't very sweet but I mixed the whipped cream in to make it sweeter. Overall, I really enjoyed eating here.

We ordered the Margherita pizza which was just okay. Definitely get extra cheese if you like a cheesy pizza. The pizza was mostly crust and tomato sauce with small dabs of fresh mozzarella. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if the pizza had more cheese on it. The other turn off for me was the noise. It is extremely loud in the restaurant. In all fairness we were seated close to the bar and it was very crowded. If I go back again I'd definitely ask to be seated far away from the bar area and order a pizza with extra cheese.,12/2/2012,32,40,4,ZV7KfFUOrJW1PKMMv5OcAw

The pizza we ordered tasted good, although we ordered a very pedestrian pizza (Margherita) and I kind of wished that we would have ordered something a little more interesting. The service was adequate; considering there are no refills and once they drop off your pizza they never really come back to check on you. I agree with another review, which stated that they couldn't get over the feeling this place is trying to nickel and dime every customer who walks through the doors. Soda starts at $3. No refills. A basic pizza is over $20. They use paper plates and plastic cups. If I'm going to eat pizza off a paper plate, I shouldn't pay a premium for it.",9/26/2017,8,250,782,y6nCJj6kP4ynm1AvGlcmkg

But the problem is that the pizza only has one big size. After we ate one or two slices, the tastes started to be bland. One reason could be that it gets cold, and the clams are no longer as flavorful. The other reason is that the dough is salty. So after a few bites, the salt flavor covered the clam flavor. If they had a small size, I would have liked it more. The service is good. They only accept cash. But they have an ATM inside the restaurant.",9/24/2017,43,383,917,PW-FPm_fZ7spmknmvfriyw

1223,Saba C.,0,4,"Another run-of-the-mill, authentic pizzeria, in my opinion. Before the faithful throw their half-eaten slices at me and their looks turn from hatred to mortification at the realization that they threw their beloved slice of Lombardi's, let me explain.It's a great establishment. It's the oldest too. It's one of those places you need to go to when/if you're in New York. Their pizza is good, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Am I spoiled for choice for slices in the Big Apple? Probably. Which is exactly why I think Lombardi's is GOOD, but not exceptional. You'll get the same thing at Grimaldi's, or Patsy's. Though I'd steer clear of Patsy's if I were you. Lombardi's is just BETTER, hands down.The clam pie was good, but a bit overwhelming in terms of chew. My jaw started hurting. But it was good. It was worth it. Again, it's one of those places you need to go to just to get it off the bucket-/check-list. Oh, I forgot. The server got our bill confused and charged us for two clam pies instead of a clam and a margherita.

1224,Anthony M.,1,5,"MEATBALL PIZZAI can hardly believe I haven't written a review for this place. I first came here about 15 years ago. We were on a business trip and I wanted the best pizza in New York. I can not remember who sent us here but I've been a regular ever since. This place is on my food list for every visit I make to New York City. Don't waste your times with the crappy cardboard slices on the streets. Come here and get the whole pizza served fresh!I remember on our first trip here I spotted meatballs as a topping. I had to talk my group into ordering them. Here I was lobbying for meatballs on too of a pizza. I remember saying, ""Have you ever seen meatballs as a choice? It has to be good!"" I couldn't believe at how hard it was to get this choice approved by my co-workers.  And in the end...they were loving the meatball topping like it was there own idea. So next time you visit please consider the meatball as a topping. I know on our many trips meatball topping was non-negotiable because it was a must for every visit.I really feel like I must share some history here. This restaurant is the oldest licensed pizzeria in New York City. This happen back in 1905 which means this place has been turning out pizza for over 100 years. It is even recognized by the Pizza Hall of Fame as the first pizzeria in the United States. So honestly why wouldn't you come here for a slice of history.It all started in 1897 when Gennaro Lombardi started selling tomato pies out of his grocery store. He built up a huge cliental among the local factory workers in the area for lunch. The tomato pies were wrapped in paper and tied with a string making it easy for them to carry it out. We almost could lobby to give them the title of oldest carry out joint but I'm not sure that is a real title. The restaurant is currently run by the grandson of Gennaro Lombardi making it 3 generations of Lombardi pizza in NYC. The current location even has a coal oven just like it was originally used back in the day over 100 years ago. I grew up on Chicago pizza, so I am jaded when I come to New York. This place really satisfies me. It really does remind me of pizza in Italy and I just like the traditional taste of original Italian pizza. I promise this place is excellent and that you will love every bite of your slice only if you add meatballs. Ha! I know I can't let the meatballs go but you have to add them to your pizza. You will be glad you did.I look forward to my next trip to New York because I will have this amazing pizza with my favorite topping. Here is to another 100 years of making pizza in America.",8/31/2014,3674,1389,11160,CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw
1225,Manny O.,0,5,Waited 20 years to come here. Finally got the chance after three times in New York. Gluten-free and dairy-free for 15 years and I dived right in and had a religious experience. I don't care what happens to my tummy after.... that is for my poor Hotel roommates to suffer through. Service was amazing prompt and very courteous. Have the classic marguerita and you will not be disappointed.,10/24/2016,1,43,20,-BEqhNneiKc8X4NxJCLY_w
1226,Jack B.,0,4,Delicious as always!  Love the margarita.  Crispy crust and lovely flavor.  Tried the breadsticks this time and they were bland but marinara was good.  Breadsticks themselves were dry and could use some garlic butter or something to enhance.,4/8/2018Updated review,0,42,0,2aqdwyLC1QFuhv_xcB0h0Q
1227,N C.,0,4,"First time eating here was in 2010 and usually eat here when I visit NYC. This use to be the best pizza I have ever eaten, but it's ranked down for me. Probably because I've tried many other New York style pizzas since 2010. This is still my top 5 but but no longer number 1.Oh yeah, they take cash only. I remember paying with a card. Kind of rough cause their pizzas are not cheap.",3/26/2017Previous review,231,91,17,N4SphCH9gZDlKUTbbI6zAA
1228,Nick C.,0,3,"Tourist trap. This place was recommended to my by a fellow Italian. Cool authentic place, great back story, very good sauce, don't get me wrong but we paid $75 for a calzone, a small pizza with meatballs, a small salad and two tiny glasses of wine. This is ridiculous even for NYC. Not only that but I changed my order from pepperoni to meatball because the picture on the wall was these huge meatballs and I got these tiny little buggers. Not really what I was hoping for. To be fair, it was good. It was fresh. It was authentic. It was not worth $75",10/23/2016,294,18,7,jdEBDZr6Qm_l3A6vgUquBQ
1229,Fran B.,1,3,"It could be that I was expecting a lot more from them..... as I'm sure everyone did. I feel kinda bad dumping them in my 3-star category (not that 3 stars is bad, but who wants to be average?), but I gotta by honest with myself lol.I love pizza. I'm not thaaaaaaaaat picky when it comes to pizza, but I do LOVE a good chewy, thin crust. So for that, I give Lombardi's props. Their crust is probably my favorite part, and probably some of the better crust I've had when it comes to pizza anywhere.My bf and I shared a small - half white pizza and half margherita. We added pepperoni, meatballs, mushrooms, and red onions. A small should be enough for a party of 2.The margherita was good and saucy. I did like how saucy this pizza was... lol by that I mean, it's a little ""wetter"" than your average pie. Could have had more cheese to balance it out though. The meatball was my favorite topping.The white pizza was oooookay. It definitely wasn't bad but I kinda expected it to be more exciting. I've made white pizza before, and while my version wasn't that good, it certainly wasn't that much worse lol :( There's a NY style pizzeria near my house (in CA), whose owner lived in NYC, and I thought their version of white pizza is much better (2 minute drive vs. 5.25 hour flight + 1 hour travel). I think the problem I had with Lombardi's version is the lack of flavor. It had a good amount of ricotta topping, but it didn't really come seasoned? It had all that creaminess to it, but it needed more flavor. My bf thought it was gross LOL. He no like.So even with these problems, I didn't think Lombardi's pizza was bad by any means. It was still enjoyable, but didn't leave a lasting impression on me. And when the bill came (we didn't really look at how much everything cost), I was kinda surprised that it came out to be over $50. 1 small pizza and 2 drinks... If you think about it, that's really expensive for a pizza meal.It was an experience though. Now I can say I've eaten at the first pizzeria in the US!",5/2/2016,904,676,120,5AJRqMc0y4yYW-YEz3FEuQ
1230,Brenda O.,0,5,The BEST place ever! Every time I come to NY my first stop is Lombardis. I can no explain how good it is. I wish they had this place in LA. It's a nice old school pizza place.

1232,Mary T.,1,4,"How can you not visit the first pizza place in America? Honestly, it would've been easy for me had we not been staying a few blocks away. I don't like long waits and find many times places don't live up to their lore. We put our name in, got a buzzer and grabbed a beer at the bar while we waited. The beer list is serviceable, the most interesting thing is Yuengling. After what seemed like an inordinately long wait, we inquired about the list; turns out we were somehow assigned a buzzer, but left off of the list. Not a good start to our experience.We were seated in the basement, which is like a cave and by my assessment the worst seat in the house. Six (ish) tables + no windows = no ambiance whatsoever. The only thing it had going for it was its proximity to the bathroom. Not improving our overall experience thus far.We were hungry when we put in our name, we (me) were hangry by the time we got seated. We started with an order of the bruschetta and ordered a large classic with half sweet sausage. There are three base pizzas - classic (or margherita), white or clam. There are a number of sides you can order to customize your pizza, but beware, they aren't cheap at $4 each.The bruschetta was great, the tomatoes nice and sweet, the bread soft, yet crispy. The pizza was good too; great crust, foldable slices. I'll be honest though, it's not my favorite pizza overall; it's been over a week since I've had it and I don't crave it specifically. The crust was probably my favorite part.Overall 3.5 stars - Good? Yes. The best? Doubtful and kind of pricey for what it is. Bring your appetite and you cash because they don't do slices or take plastic.",5/27/2017,136,1194,47,jAiGoRmj3eAkeH_3KfudXg

As a known pizza joint celebrating a NY-style, a friend recommended we go to Lombardi's for a bite. The pace was fast in getting a seat, another common pattern across eateries in NYC I've noticed over the years. After being seated in the Italian decorated environment, we ordered our (small) Pizza with Homemade Meatballs and awaited the best......what came was a 14"" pie with well-seasoned meatballs sliced and placed onto a mozzarella covered marinara for an aesthetically pleasing pie. However, the flavor was only fine. Fine isn't a word I'd generally use to describe pizza. It was okay, alright, or so-so. There was nothing about it that made it delicious and mouthwatering. From its aroma to its crust, the pizza remained only fine. A disappointing initial stop in a city known for cuisine, but I appreciated Lombardi's for its history and tradition.  So many competitive restaurants would not have come about if not for an inspired slice so many years ago.",10/2/2017,313,317,679,EhLjYnYIlZdQSmwM1zXnPw

Great location in Little Italy.  Initial walk-in, they have this awesome doll house version of their actual location, it was the cutest thing! Attached to the ceiling. We told them we needed a table for 3 and we were seated right away. They walked us through the kitchen, to the back where there was upstairs. I'll call it the VIP room, hahaha. My legs were so exhausted from walking around all day, i couldn't believe that i had to walk up stairs in the restaurant. Not gonna lie -- we literally ordered a pepperoni pizza, because we've been eating ALL day! We went with something basic, something to satisfy all three sisters. The 14"" has 6 slices...perfect amount for us. This was already $25 and they only take cash only, which is the downfall...i need card accepted!

1242,Sean H.,1,4,"Oldest pizza shop in America? Yep, pin that to my to-do list in New York. By now, you'd expect Lombardi's to know what they're doing when it comes to pizza. With more than 100 years of experience, they better serve up some good eats. Pizza here was definitely pretty on point though. Crust was the best part. Perfectly crisp all around. Their mozarella cheese was pretty drool-worthy as well. Far from being the best pizza I've ever had though.Super busy though, as expected. 45+ minute wait for dinner. Me and my friends decided to ghetto it up and just order to go, but eat outside on one of their benches. Whatever works right? If you're planning to dine in, remember to give yourself plenty of time! It wasn't too pricey either, which is kinda surprising due to the ""tourist"" label that this place carries.Don't know if I'd come back to this spot for the food again, but it's definitely worth a visit if not for the historic value of it all. Just think, these guys were the first of their kind here in the states. Nobody else can claim that title.

1249,Thy T.,1,5,"As a visitor to NYC, we had to eat pizza before our trip ended. Earning a bunch of stars with a good rating was what led us to try this place. I was so scared that there was going to be an insane line out the door but surprisingly, for a group of 3, we only waited 20 minutes. We came during prime dinner time too. At first, the restaurant looked really small but after our waiter led us to another part of the restaurant, I realized that was how they kept the waiting time to a minimal. We ordered one margharita pizza with no extra topping. It was on the more expensive side especially if you decide to throw on extra toppings. But in the end, each of us paid $10 so not bad for eating good pizza! I like the thin crust and how the sauce did not soak through the dough. The pizza was simple and that is how I like it. My stomach was happily satisfied at the end of the meal.Overall, we had good service, great pizza, and a fun time here.

1255,Matthew A.,0,5,"Thin. Cheesy. Saucy. Real. Those words provide a more than accurate description of the Original Margherita Pizza at Lombardi's. But I'm not surprised. They are the oldest pizzeria in the country, and have been perfecting their work since 1905. But the Margherita is not the only good thing on the menu. The white pizza is to die for. Hence the name, it has no tomato sauce. It is loaded with three types of cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, and romano) and seasoned with black pepper and oregano, and drizzled with garlic oil. All Margherita pizzas can have toppings added to them. There is an extensive list on the menu. The calzones are also impeccable. They consist of pizza dough with mozzarella and ricotta folded into a semi-circle shape and stuffed with two toppings of your choice. I recommend spinach and mushroom calzone. The menu also features nice salads, meatballs, and breadsticks for appetizers. The service is very attentive, though a bit slow at times because it is always packed. Speaking of crowds, I will seriously tell you that you have to get there at 11:30am when they open. If you don't, you will not get a table without a long wait. Yes, it's one of those places where you have to get a pager to wait, like Shake Shack. I once came it at 3:00 in the afternoon and it was still a 45 minute wait. So, get here early. But once you get in and smell the aromas of pizzas in the kitchen, you won't be sorry. The food will be amazing. I hope you enjoy the pizza as much as I did!

Nothing overly spectacular, but a great, solid pie.I don't know if it's worth waiting in the crowd every time, but it is definitely an experience that everyone should have at least once.In related news: I can finally say I've been to the big three: Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, and Di Fara!",8/13/2014,328,243,257,jKLWPimZ4dge0P6pWWgYkQ

1265,Mark B.,1,3,"Touted as the ""First Pizzeria in the USA"" I've wanted to give it a try for a while. We were in the area and decided to stop in for lunch with some friends. We all agreed that it was good, but not great.Decor: It has a pretty standard pizzeria look and feel and has plenty of tables. However, it is pretty popular with tourists so it can get crowded. Even though it is so old it seemed very clean and was very inviting. The booth we sat at was a bit squished but not so you'd really notice while seated.Bathroom: I did not use it during this visit.Staff: Our waitress left a little to be desired. She may have been new, so I'll cut her a bit of slack, but she missed some key fundamentals. While she was pretty good about taking our order quickly, I had to ask (twice) to get our waters refilled. She also failed to ask our friends if they wanted more wine and Coke.Food/Drink: We had two pizzas between the four of us: one large sausage and one small Margarita. Both were just okay. Personally, I love NY-style pizza but this was just lacking something. It really reminded me of Gramaldi's pizza, actually it's pretty much identical, in that it has about 50/50 cheese and sauce on top (big pieces of motz as opposed to completely covered with cheese). It is definitely NOT the best pizza in NYC, that title is still held by Little Italy in midtown (by a HUGE margin).Value: The prices were fine, not overly inflated due to the tourist popularity, and you pretty much get what you pay for here. Note: it is CASH ONLY.This place is like McSorely's in that you have to hit is once while in NYC but it wouldn't be a regular stop for any resident.",8/11/2014,54,829,6,Zs4v2spqvoa-O_AzfQ42bA

1267,Lala T.,0,5,"Oh how long I'd been waiting to try Lombardi's. When in NY, eat pizza and not just any pizza...eat at the first pizzeria in the US. My mouth was watering by the time we got off the subway and walked into the restaurant. There was about a 45 minute wait so we decided to order to go. At the register we looked at the menu and opted for the best of both worlds: half original margherita and half white with pepperoni and sausage. The to-go order register is right in front of the kitchen so we got to see (and smell) the deliciousness. After waiting about ten minutes the manager, Gilbert, was walking around and asked us how we were doing. We let him know it was our first night in NY and the wait was so long but we were eager to take a famous Lombardi's pizza to go. He told us to wait a few moments and he would set up a table for us. What an awesome representation of the of the restaurant and customer service at its finest. We were grateful to sit down and our pizza was delivered to our table within minutes. Our pizza: half original margherita topped with mozzarella, crushed and chunky tomato sauce, romano, basil, pepperoni and Italian sausage was amazing. The crushed tomatoes added a nice texture to the pizza and the light crispness of the crust allowed us to fold the pizza (NY style of course!) and enjoy the simple goodness. The other half, white pizza, was topped with mozzarella, ricotta, romano, oregano, basil, garlic oil, pepperoni and Italian sausage. This half had no sauce but the creaminess of the cheeses and the oil was enough to make this pizza decedent. Of course, I burned my mouth inhaling the entire pizza within minutes. It was definitely worth it. The restaurant is super casual and super busy. There are many things to look at, including photographs of the history of Lombardi's pizza. There's service was quick and efficient. For about 35 bucks, you get a small pizza (6 slices) that was a perfect amount between two people. Restaurant is CASH ONLY! It's definitely worth a try, at least once! I can't wait to be back next time I'm in NY! Lombardi's lives up to its reputation.",1/3/2016,2291,231,719,R7C_PGUiBgJbIgXNkk1I1Q
1268,Jeralyn P.,0,5,"Located in Little Italy section in Manhattan, we had a craze for pizza Friday night and my friend was EXTREMELY adamant on going to this specific pizzeria. The staff were friendly and decor seem casual, but wait....flavor was amongst us lol...we had a garden salad with their tasty house vinaigrette/dressing...followed by a large margarita pizza, half meatball and half pepperoni. I'm usually hesitant with eating pork, but that pepperoni was so good, I never ate pork so fast lol. The reason I would rate Lombardi's Pizza as the best pizza I ever had is because of the the taste and texture of the pizza. The bread was thin and crisp, the sauce was the STAR of the show, it was full of flavor and you couldn't help making sure that every bite included some sauce, the mozzarella and the basil were fresh. The margarita pizza is great on its own, but the flavorful meatball and pepperoni additions made walking home such a pain, but I left feeling very satisfied and a ""pizza snob"" who will never have a pizza, unless it's from Lombardi's.",8/4/2014,49,61,72,ZebJ5nOtpJdBS4C5D4Ft_Q

1270,Nick S.,0,3,"Fantastic red sauce. Decent pie overall. In my humble opinion, the slices are too thin. Would've liked more cheese and toppings. The real concern here is the price. $35 for pizza before tip when NYC is full of good $3 slices simply isn't competitive. It's long history and coal-fired oven must allow them to get away with these tourist prices. While it was good to try once, I would recommend just swinging by a good-smelling pizza shop pretty much anywhere that looks fresh. Pick up a filling NY meal of two slices for $6 and call it a day.Keep in mind to bring cash if you do decide to stop by Lombardi's as they are cash only. Menu is limited to 4 options. 2 of them are without a tomato base.",12/28/2016,0,3,0,EGvGy4RBN7MYAuCrWbvcHA

You basically pick the ""base"" or sauce of your choice and add toppings (ranges from $3-4, a little steep for toppings in my opinion). The four of us ordered the small 14"" original margherita pizza (add Italian sausage and mushrooms), house salad, and antipasto. The pizza was pretty decent, but was a little wet for my liking. I think all the water came from the tomato sauce and it made all the toppings slide off. Very difficult to eat without a fork/knife.Service was alright.

I know there is so much history and prestige riding along Lombardi's pizza, but honestly, I really don't see what all the hype was.My first visit to NYC and I definitely bookmarked Lombardi's. I wanted genuine, NY style pizza, and from what I've heard from numerous friends, this was the place to go.For a small pizza (great for two people) you pay a base price and with each additional topping it's either $2-3 depending if you wanted it on your whole pie or just half of the pizza.My friend and I shared a half Portobello mushroom half Italian meatball pizza. It was good. But I wouldn't say phenomenal. The good:-nice crispy crust-love the usage of slices of mozzarella instead of shredded-not overwhelming amount of sauce-the meatball was moist and delicious-definitely healthier and less greasy than most pizzas I'm use toThe not so good-the mushroom made that half of the pizza a bit soggy-although the sauce was good..it was just a little off for me. Perhaps I'm used to a sweeter sauce?-flavors on the meatball was good, but overall flavor of the entire pizza was just okay.-i wish it was cheesierIn my opinion, it was a tad bit overpriced. However, the small did serve two people (with an appetite) perfectly. We weren't super stuff and after eating the pizza didn't have that gross bloated feeling...so win?Give it a try.",4/12/2013,690,884,805,iYeLvhAGiUgKeNkZV19_IQ

1278,M. M.,0,1,"First time here- Don't let the massive crowd fool you into thinking this place is worth tiring. We arrived to a long line and a ""45min"" wait as quoted by the guy at the door....We waited an HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES to be seated.We also asked the people at the front if we can place an order to eat at the bar which was completely empty only to be told they ""don't do that"" then we asked if we could place an order before being seated so the pizza would be ready faster (considering how long we have already been waiting) and again we were told no and that the pie would take only 3min to warm up.Well once we finally were seated and ordered the pie it took ANOTHER 15MIN to get out order.We got the white pizza with sausage, which was disappointing to say the least. The sausage is cut in flat disks like pepperoni and sprinkled very sparingly. The pizza was overwhelmingly cheesy. And lacking in garlic and basil. Overall it seemed that they sired to save $$$ on making this pizza with only using as little product as they can get away with.After two slices I felt overly full due to the creamy ricotta and overload of cheese.This is a tourist trap.... I truly regret paying $40 for a large pie when the city is full of amazing pizza for half the cost and double the flavor and quality. I feel ripped off.(Btw the beer is $8 a glass with no refills same for wine-$8)First and last time, would NOT recommend - don't feed into the hype.",12/30/2015,0,229,20,I27IZdNrZAKI2oakFenc1Q

There's just more, more sauce, cheese and toppings.We waited only about 10 minutes to be seated; even though it was busy, our food came out at a reasonable pace. Without beer though, it would have been torture waiting with all the smells and watching others enjoying their deliciousness.

1297,Chau P.,1,4,"1:30 p.m. Saturday - 3 People1. Ambiance:  The layout of the restaurant is very adorable. Booth and tables, with an overlook of windows and paintings. It has a warm and family style setting. This place is for casual dining based on the setup. There are an abundance of seating as there is also a back area. 2. Food: We ordered the small Margherita Pizza with sausages topping. The tomato sauce was really fresh and aromatic. Mozzarella were in different patches on top of the pizza, thinly spread. Fresh basil leaves were spread evenly over the top of the pizza as well. The dough was crispy and thin. The pizza did not have much grease and it felt like every ingredient/component of this pizza was made with high quality products.3. Service: The waiter was slow in movement to assist us as it was busy around 1:30 p.m. As much as we had gesticulated and made aware of our presence, we failed to obtain better service. 4. Costs: Approximately $20 for a large pizza. Worth the price to satisfy your taste buds. The pizza is a good size that can be divided into three slices per person. Fulfilling, probably not. If you're still hungry, order a second one. Our table ordered two pizzas and we walked away elated.  5. Overall Experience: This place was established in 1905 and there is a reason that it continues to thrive. Hands down, one of the best pizzas I have tasted in NYC.",9/21/2014,302,157,299,Q-reN0-rqKjirkHdGsksBw

I wish the Ninja Turtles could share this with me?  No?  Well, here it is.  I crown this place king of New York Pizza (red sauce only!).  A word of advice : Order items that don't shed water when cooked, that goes for mushrooms, onions, and any sort of veggie that like to piss water.  Given that, I cheated a little and had the Pepperoni, Sausage, and roasted bell pepper pizza and holy crapola was it good.  The mozzarella had awesome flavor, the best tasting pepperoni and sausage ever on a pizza, crust was oven-fired perfectly crisp, and the sauce was second to none.  I like that they use a LOT of sauce on the pizza and the pizza still remains crispy (I do tend to eat fast though heh).  You can tell their oven is the real deal creme of the crop shiznat!By the end of the meal, the roof of my mouth had battle scars all over it, but it was worth ever bit skin being burned off, even though I was playing with bits of skin for the rest of the day with my tongue ...The pizza is pricey though as the small pizza we ordered costed $30, but I would pay that again in a second for such a fine pizza.5 stars!",10/30/2012,178,1188,1213,QWxW_pApmpY9iPApC8P-UQ

Confession: I seriously have dreams about the white pizza that they serve here - the chewiness of the dough combined with the ricotta flowers on the pizza is an AMAZING combination, and I would come back here every time I visit New York just for a slice (or 4) of this pizza! The ricotta is perfect and the cheeses are perfectly balanced, chewy, and stringy!I also tried the margherita pizza and didn't find anything special about it. It's still a great slice of pizza but the sauce was too sour for my taste and the cheese didn't speak out to me. The dough also loses it's crisp and starts to get soggy very quickly. If you're going to order the margherita, make sure to get pepperoni on it, as the pepperoni was delicious and gave the pie a salty and savory kick. This place might be filled with tourists but it's still a place I would come back to. Portions are very generous. A small is a little too much for 2 people while a large might be perfect/a little too much for 3 people. Choose wisely depending on the appetite of the people you're with!

White pizzas are my favorite but this one didn't do it for me. The ricotta used didn't seem fresh and texture threw me off. It was way too creamy to be on a pizza.

It kind of ruined the taste of the pizza but we were starving, gobbled it down in seconds. The pizza kept falling off if you hold it, so a fork and a knife was a must.

Food try both Chicago deep dish pizza (which is next on my eating bucket list) AND New York thin crust pizza, I knew I had to have some for myself.My friend who just recently moved to Manhattan knew that Lombardi's was (supposedly) the first pizzeria established in America, so we decided to give it a go. I called to see if a reservation was necessary, but the man who answered the phone told me, in the thickest New Yorker accent you can imagine, ""Nah you don't needa reservation. We got lotsa room heeah at Lombardi's."" Soon enough, we found ourselves in front of Lombardi's and its iconic Monica Lisa mural on its front wall.We walked in, waited for maybe 2 seconds and were whisked away through a labyrinth of hungry people, pizza, dough, flour and stairs. We were finally seated and decided to go with the classic margherita pizza with sausage.Fifteen minutes later, the pie came out and, boy, was it pretty. It was huge, first of all, but if you have four or five people in your group (especially if you have guys), you may want to order two pizzas.But I digress. We each took a slice and WOAH this was the stuff right here! It was good pizza alright. Now I don't know if it was the tacky red plaid table cloth, the cherub paintings on the ceiling or Lombardi's reputation, but at that very moment, I felt that I could not be having a more authentic pizza experience.But why four stars? Unfortunately, the pizza did not blow me away. Sure, it was SOLID (and I mean solid in every way imaginable) thin crust pizza, but I wasn't completely wowed. Nevertheless, I'm glad I came here.

1307,Andrea J.,0,4,Margarita Pizza and the original were amazing! But very over priced even for Little Italy! Service was great oh yea and bring cash!!! Only cash establishment! Food was good only 5 selections of pizzas. But it was a good time.,7/25/2017,10,37,63,TCQatqUoRmx5FfXMRgLy4w
1308,Chris E.,1,3,"Straight to the point, unfortunately I expected better. Lombardi's is indeed world famous, but if you pay attention it's not world famous for the taste of their pizza, but world famous for being the 1st recognized pizzeria in the world. There's obviously a big difference between the two. First, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and ""old school"" look/decor. It's not a huge restaurant with a medium size dining area and basement, which is relatively small fitting only about 7 tables.As for the pizza, I felt it tasted like regular NY pizza, but thinner. The crust was thin and the pizza was not extremely thick with cheese or toppings like regular NY pizza. From a health perspective, that might be a plus along with the surprisingly low level of oil on their pizza. In fact, I didn't see any oil drip off my slice of pizza at all. The crust was a tad more burnt and chewy than I preferred so it was harder to chew and breakdown. The toppings were good though, however I hardly noticed them while eating the pizza. We had the mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni and spinach, and I was a longing for a larger amount of the toppings on the pizza.Overall, it's a NY historic landmark that serves ""average"" pizza, but in the 21st Century there are so many more options in NY which serve better tasting pizza with more variety, larger amounts of toppings and lively atmospheres. It seems Lombardi's is a pizzeria stuck in an old time machine and in need of an upgrade.",2/23/2013,545,1176,10495,m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ
1309,Jigar G.,0,5,"Visiting NYC for the first time, so it only makes sense to eat some great pizza. Came here with my family at around 7pm, but we were missing one person from our party. They don't take reservations for parties less than eight, but they surprisingly had an open table. Despite this, they don't seat incomplete parties so we had to wait for 15 min after our person arrived, which was disappointing considering we were ready to order. Their lack of accomodation would've reduced the rating by a star if the food wasn't so amazing. We were taken to the back room of an old school building - I had fun walking through it, it was almost like a museum. I think we sat above the oven, because the floor was actually really hot and we could feel a little heat through our shoes, but it wasn't uncomfortable. Everyone I was with was vegetarian, so clam pie was out of question, but we ordered the Margherita and the White Pizza with no toppings, and they came out in a reasonable time.The cups were plastic and the water was barely cool, but who cares!? We were there for pizza. When they came out it looked exactly as I'd imagined, and tasted beyond what I possibly could have. Both pizzas were great; however I liked the Margherita a bit more only because I liked the perfect level of tang from the sauce. The white pizza was great too, and because k starves myself that day to enjoy to the fullest, I easy at two slices of each. It is a must go for New Yorkers and tourists alike (no, I am not a New Yorker, but I've had Grimaldi's and it was good, but not quite as amazing)",8/19/2015,141,44,69,pARrCu3d4FnD0byKg9WeTQ
1310,Wen Jin G.,1,5,"america's first pizza place is as good as it gets!there was barely a wait and we were seated in the downstairs area, much quieter and it's cool to see their wine collections.  the menus are quite limited and the have premium and regular toppings.  after perusing the menu, we went with the 14"" (6 slices) margherita, meatballs on half of it.  after a short wait, we were greeted with perfectly charred pizza.  i tried the meatball slice first, the meatballs were a mix of pork and beef, well-seasoned and stood up to the tangy tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and a thin, crackly, crispy crust.  it was very tasty!  the margherita side was great as well, however, it could benefit from more basil leaves (what's with these pizza places skimping on basil?!).  great sauce, toppings, and crunchy crust, Lombardi's has managed to perfect all the elements to make a great pizza.  i've always been afraid of super famous places, because chances are, they are usually HUGE letdowns (yes, i'm looking at you Grimaldi's!).  but after trying Lombardi's, i'm very happy to announce, believe the hype!",7/20/2014,79,197,798,017JpqRIhIWflKPoLPEFxA

The only problem was the table was downstairs, less nicer area than upstairs and the air conditioning is crazy cold. It took another 30min for pizza to arrive which was worth it. Very thin crust with the toppings of your choice. Tomato sauce was really good. Even though it looked like an overrated touristy spot the pizza was really good.

1320,Michelle C.,0,5,"There is a reason why this place has almost 5,000 reviews , it's because everyone will find something they truly enjoy , and it's suitable for all ages all groups big and small all families and all occasions . Being that this famous place is in the heart of little Italy I highly recommend both locals and tourists to try this place to eat real pizza . You can tell that the oven has such a big impact on the pizza , from the crispy crust to the way the sauces and cheese melts together , and trust me each slice is super filling , you better come with a big appetite . This place has a long line for a table but this place has two floors and several dining rooms so there is enough room to accommodate tons of people . What I recommend from this place is the white pizza , cake boss pizza topped with a mountain of arugula and prosciutto and cheese , and the original pizza with fresh basil tomato sauce which isn't too acidic and perfect amount of cheese is heaven . Despite all the good toppings on these pies already you have the luxury of adding more toppings for just two or three dollars each . I also am a huge fan of the fresh bruschetta , all the ingredients are so fresh as if they were all grown in a garden , not too much oil not too much onion, it was perfect and great for sharing . I love how the personal calzone was the size of my head which has tons of cheese meat and a generous cup of sauce , the thick crunchy crust was amazing , I would literally eat it everyday, everything works so perfectly together . As fancy as these pizzas look , the menu and place itself is quite simple and I appreciate this place for that . I have to say the waiters seem overwhelmed here but they are very patient and knowledgeable on the menu. Our group had at least 10-12 people and the waitress we had was very patient when we placed our order . I also admire the extensive wine menu and cool items like Italian soda that has whipped cream on top , major win. I can go on and on about why I love this place but you're better off seeing it for yourself , you will be blown away on how this place has mastered the art of pizza and Italian cuisine .",11/29/2016,882,419,505,lTbFH4xlNakMIV70tKCNog
1321,Grace C.,0,3,"I was excited to come here on my trip to New York. it was one of the two pizza places i wanted to go to. My friend and I originally were each going to order a slice of the white pizza and the margherita pizza and share but we found out that they dont sell by the slice. so then we had to order an entire pizza. We got a small half margherita and half white. The margherita was your typical standard pizza, good but nothing super special. The white pizza, i want to say was good, but in my opinion lacked flavor. I added a ton of other toppings to make it taste like something. however, it had a ton of ricotta which added a nice texture to the pizza. I wish they would sell by the slice because my friend and I were stuffed and still had leftovers. I can see it being good for groups though. The service was great, very friendly but I dont see myself coming again.",1/27/2016,36,123,409,aFHpq8IuEiqJBGrXuPFfag

1323,Sarah A.,0,4,Amazing pizza! We were starving and were able to  sit down quickly. Our pizza arrived in 10 minutes! It was delicious.

The service was decent but I have definitely had better pizza with much better service. The Cake Boss pizza is good if you take most of the arugula off of it. Water tasted like it was coming from the toilet we were sitting right next to. Menu is very small and they are not open to make any changes for you.

1327,Amir A.,1,1,"Disappointing experience. Having heard so much of this place, I saved this famed NYC pizza joint as my last stop after a week of delicious NY pizzas. Having met up with an old friend and trying their margherita pizza, I was disappointed that the taste was not up to par with some of the other NYC pizza's I had and worse, that the pizza was just lukewarm. Pizza that is not adequately heated when served is certainly the largest offense one can make at a pizza joint. Having had a great experience at other NYC pizza joints, that taste far better for a fraction of the price, I doubt I'll be back.Also - although it seems like an upscale pizza joint it is Cash only!",12/3/2014,428,361,69,a1a5HG0Cfn38oIf0KpvwWQ

We added mushrooms to one of them, and garlic spinach to another. Glad we went with the combo to try both, but both our favorites was the mozzarella/marinara. The white was too cheesy for our taste, I mean it was literally cheese pizza without any sauce. Couldn't eat more than one slice of that. Not bad for about $20 though, or $25 after the topping add-ons. ** cash only **!

You just cant get anything close to this out in San Diego and it makes me sad.  This whole trip is going to ruin my taste buds for pizza.  Another amazing pizza in NY!  The oldest pizzeria is still cranking out some of the best pizza in NY!",6/20/2012,111,1233,1667,6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA

My boyfriend, sister, and I got there right before the dinner rush, so we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. I would imagine that they get very busy, so to avoid a long line, get there a little early. We were seated in the farthest dining room which we reached by walking through the kitchen, which was cool because we got to see the process but also slightly confusing when trying to navigate our way out later. We ordered the classic Margherita pizza to share, and anxiously awaited its arrival. When it came it looked amazing: large mozzarella pools on  top of tomato sauce and topped with fresh basil. The coal oven they cook the pizza in made the crust the perfect amount of crunch and flavor. I have tried pizza in Naples and this did remind me of it a lot. Very very good thin crust pizza for my Chicagoan boyfriend to try - as a lover of deep dish he also thought the pizza was delicious.They are cash only so come prepared!

1338,Parul G.,0,3,"Lombardi's is another one of those NY institutions that have long lines but are short on satisfying the taste buds. To avoid lines go during lunch time on a random weekday, because any other time the lines are out the door and their pizza isn't worth the 2 hour wait. The ambiance feels like its made for tourists with ads for Lombardi t-shirts and pizzas for $30 and up, which is pretty expensive since NYC has much better pizza places for much less. I went with my brother on a lazy afternoon and thankfully didn't have to wait at all! We ordered the Margherita pizza, which I was disappointed to see was a little soggy. The crust I felt couldn't hold the cheese and toppings and wasn't crispy or particularly tasty. There was too much cheese and not enough of that tomato and basil flavor I expect out of a good slice of margherita pizza. Overall the pizza was hot, fresh and tasted good, but was it something that I would wait it line for...no. Is it worth $30 plus dollars....no. There are so many other pizza places to try in NYC and nothing here stands out from an ordinary slice of pizza I can grab walking down the street.

Although most people have had to wait for hours, you can't say that there aren't a lot of tables. There is a main dining room as well as additional space upstairs.Everyone here is very quick and they know how to deal with crowds. Believe me when I say they are efficient. I am not a super huge fan of pizza but I do enjoy a good slice here and there. What makes it cool is that you can see the brick ovens in the back. the fresh ingredients make the crispy thin crust pizza as good as it is.

1348,Drew R.,0,2,"For a small pizza, and added mushroom and pepperoni (mushroom on half, pepperoni on the other half) it was 32.35 with tax.  That's a lot for a small pizza, anywhere in the world. Even a lot in the New York area.  While I know it's a tourist attraction, you should get a little more bang for your buck. I gave the waiter $40 (cash, they don't take debit or credit cards) and he gave me a funny look when I asked for change back. I'm sorry - but you shouldn't expect an $8 tip for bringing over a pizza and two plastic cups with water. The food - absolutely delicious. But again, not much bang for your buck. I ate four out of the six slices (my wife-to-be ate the other two) and I went to bed hungry last night. There was an odd skunk smell to this place as well, especially near the entrance and near the drink station. That should be checked out and addressed immediately.Needless to say, this place should be a one shot deal if you even go at all.

We ordered a Margarita Pizza and a clam pizza among 5 of us one half of the table, and it was gone almost instantaneously. Safe to say one of the best spots in the city....BUT things I wasn't too keen on. For this price, it is kind of ridiculous.This was a big place, but it was cash only which created panic amongst the 10 of us. You'd except somewhere this large with this much weight to accept cards at this point, and I had to go to the ATM where I was slapped with a fat $3.50 fee. If you have the money (in cash) definitely go to Lombardi's at least once. Best pizza in town, but totally not worth it to keep going, pizza is great in many places in New York and for much cheaper too.",7/15/2015,577,42,7,ReR0GpCVpNwEsgeEAfgOXg

1355,Lana T.,1,3,"I'm extremely picky about pizza and this was one of the top choices to visit on my yelp 'to try' list.  Venue: (3/5) Exactly what I envisioned of an italian pizza place in little italy.  It had cute tables and a nice bar in the back to use while waiting.  There is a second restaurant that is dry ('No Alcohol') which is where our group we sat.  Service: (3/5) The host stand was amazing and nice.  They sat people like a science and watching them talk in their head sets made them look official at what they did.  Once we were seated that was when the service fizzled.  We were not sure where are waiters were and we had to go grab our own menus.  Food: (3/5) The Pizza was Meh, there are so many better places in the city.  We ordered two small pizzas, perfect for 3-4 people.  One pizze had pepperoni, sausage, onion, procuitto.  The other had ricotta.  The ricotta pizza looked too pretty to eat (check out the picture I posted).  However both were not rememberable and I wouldn't come back unless i had people that were adament about going.Tip: Cash only.",12/17/2012,382,337,162,3uqjuJq3IFt6f-ASU-ZHXw
1356,Nicole M.,0,3,"I was underwhelmed by Lombardi's. My brother and I were looking for a place to eat and of course checked Yelp for ideas. Our first choice was way too crowded and we didn't have time to wait, but we saw that Lombardi's was only just around the corner. It was crowded but we were seated right away and the service was relatively fast. Our server was very nice and attentive despite how busy it was. We ordered a small margherita pie and it wasn't anything special, especially for the price. I've had better pizza in Philly, so that's saying something. Maybe their other pies are better or adding some toppings would have elevated it, but they were too expensive for just a quick bite. We also got lemon and blood orange spritzers which were good, but we ended up paying $40, including the tip, for a small pizza and two drinks.

My only explanation is that their taste buds must be defunct.I waited for fifteen minutes to enter, and another fifteen minutes after I ordered. The pizza arrived on a stand, in all its half-margherita, half-white glory. I was so excited to dig in. The margherita is fanTAStic. I don't know how to describe it. The thin crust provides the perfect base for the explosion of flavors from the red sauce, the cheesy mozzarella, the spinach, and the tasty meatball topping. My one complaint is the uneven spread of sauce across the pizza. I disliked the white pizza. It was too creamy and heavy for my tastes. It's a personal thing, though-- if thicker is your style, you'll love it.For a thin crust pizza, Lombardi's slices were very filling. All in all, the pizza was good. A solid pizza as any. It's not mindblowingly transformative, but it warrants at least four stars. Don't be persuaded by the negative Nancys!",7/2/2015,417,39,118,gK5fw6ApMhYChZh_y9N6aA

Because we did not dine in at Lombardi's, this review is solely based on the margherita pizza that we ordered to go.The pizza was alright. A bit underwhelming to be honest. The pie we were given was a bit under cooked and as a result, a bit too chewy for my liking. The sauce and cheese were above average but lacked a distinct flavor that would make this place a ""must try.""Overall: the pizza is above average and I'm glad that I can finally say that I had tried the historic Lombardi's pizza.",8/10/2015,3,18,13,-9vBOcowQma0LD1U9Azx1w

Tonight we had just the classic pepperoni and sausage with bread sticks. The sauce is absolutely amazing. The mozzarella is so fresh. The sausage has the perfect kick to it. Having been open 111 years this place still has it locked down. This is the one pizzeria anyone visiting New York has to go to at least once.

Unlike most Margherita pizzas where the cheese is clumped into little balls and spread sparsely throughout the pie, this cheese was spread throughout the pizza and had a generous amount.

White side had added mushrooms, sauce side had sausage and ricotta. Both sides had basil. Tip, get the sauce. We also got meatballs, a Brooklyn lager, and soda. $60. Ouch. To be honest, I'd pay it again. Notes:1. Cash only2. A 14 in (regular) can easily feed 3 people3. Even if you like sauceless pizza, try the sauce, I wish I had4. Brooklyn Lager -- YUM5.

1373,Kimberly C.,0,4,"Lombardi's has the quintessential ""pizza pie"". I first heard about Lombardi's when my Uber driver who had grown up with a family-owned pizzeria said it was the best pizza he's ever had in New York City. Seemed like a legit enough reason to check it out. The decor of the restaurant is Classic Italian American with references to the motherland and checkered tablecloths - kind of reminded me of the Godfather in some weird way.While not the stereotypical chewy New York pizza oozing with Orange-y grease, Lombardi's pizza was delightful- reminiscent of a traditional Italian style. The crust was crispy unlike the more chewy, doughy New York pizzas. And with cheese that stretches on and on, you can tell Lombardi's uses good quality mozzarella - none of that vacuum-sealed, pre-shredded or plastic-wrapped crap you find in the grocery stores. All in all, Lombardi's has pretty good pizza, customizable toppings, traditional flavours . I would definitely recommend checking it out. P.S. Bring cash!P.P.S. Check out the Tiramisu next door.

Full of flavor from the sauce to the mozzarella to the prosciutto and everything else in between of deliciousness! Cooked in a coal-oven, the crust is just the right consistency that compliments the pizza's flavors. It's cash only, but with an ATM inside so nothing to worry.

We ordered a large and had a ton of left overs. I was actually full off of one huge slice :XI deducted one star because their service was quite poor. Our server never brought out the waters we asked for and seemed inconvenienced by our ""touristy"" questions. I can tell he was much more attentive to locals and seemed annoyed and amused by us.

We arrived 11:45am on a Sunday and were promptly seated, so that's good.Now, I live in a family where two members don't eat pork, so we were planning to split the pizza in half. However, my mom (who doesn't eat pork) wanted some meat, but there are no purely beef toppings (meatballs are pork and beef together). So she ended up getting veggies only...not what she wanted.Now, onto the pizza...the presentation seemed good. However, once we started to dig in, we realized the toppings kept falling down onto the plate. So it was definitely soggy. The toppings were good, but the pizza...meh. It may be because I'm a deep dish fan, but it was way too thin and way too soggy for me to enjoy it.I guess I need to make a stop in Chicago again.",9/5/2012,75,1231,1340,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA
1384,Vincent C.,0,4,"TL;DR  You come here for the pizza and to not get FOMO (place is landmarked as the first pizzeria in the U.S!)Lombardi's is one of the rare restaurants that I consider rightfully touristy (Katz is the only other one).  It's certified the first pizzeria in the U.S., but on top of that their pizza is actually one of the best in NYC, not as over-priced as other places, no 2 1/2 hour wait, and very easy to get to for tourists.  The last three points are knocks at Di Fara.   The cheese here is usually cooked to perfection where it stretches like a scene from your childhood memories of TMNT cartoon episodes.  The biggest issue I have is that their pizza needs toppings, so it's best not to hold back.  My go to is always Spinach, pepperoni, and sausage (4 toppings and you risk a pizza that can't hold the toppings, and I think they cap you at 5). This topping combination has never failed to impress my friends from out of town or ones in town.Here are the things you shouldn't get here:1. Pizza with no toppings-If you are a cheese fan like me...this will not do.  Seriously you need to get toppings, other wise you might as well get a slice a 2 bros.2. Ricotta impastata-what is this?  It's cheese, so I thought i would get it to make my pizza cheesier.  Well this topping made my pizza taste like there was mashed potatoe on top.  It literally covers all the tastes of the pizza with bland ricotta cheese.  I don't know what I was expecting...I guess it was my fault for ordering it.3. Italian soda-It's seltzer water with hand put flavorings and whipped cream....again, I don't know what I was expecting.Overall, if you're a tourist, I don't know why you wouldn't go here.  You're in NYC, nyc food is pizza, and this is the first pizzeria.  if a=b and b=c than a=c nahaimean?  Everyone's been to the Met, but not everyone's eaten at the first American pizzeria.",1/12/2015,79,76,135,qGVHHEJ1di7Hq2-V2_E-tA

1386,Michael B.,0,3,"This place is known as the oldest pizzeria in New York City and the birth place of New York style pizza. It's located on the corner of Spring and Mott Street one block away from the 6 line. Pizza is a favorite good of mine so I wanted to see what made this pizza famous. The place is deceptively large. You can't tell from the outside but there are multiple rooms on two floors. I almost got lost when i left my table to go to the bathroom. It was hard to find my way back. The menu is sweet and simple and ask for on one page. The day went they did have a small special menu.  They have two types of pizza and then you get to choose whatever toppings you want. First is the original margherita, which is fresh mozzarella, fresh crushed tomatoes sauce typed with romano and fresh basil. Then there is the white pizza, which has no sauce. It's topped with mozzarella, ricotta, romano, oregano, basil, black pepper and garlic infused oil.  My family and I tried the margherita with sausage topping.  It's a good pizza, the crust is thin and has a nice crisp bottom. It has a good sauce, and it's hard to go wrong with mozzarella.  But compared to the other famous brick oven pizza, Grimaldi's, it's not as good.  I don't know exactly what it is but Grimaldi's is just a better tasting pizza.  We also tried the special clam pizza.  This was a no sauce pizza with clam and fresh herb topping.  It comes with fresh lemon in the middle for you to squeeze the juice onto the pizza.  The flavor was good and it was unique.  I can't say I've had a clam pizza before this. However the clams came out a bit chewy. And as the pizza cooled on the table, the colder it got the harder it was to eat.Would I come back here? Maybe.  If I had a visitor coming in from out of town and they desperately wanted to try New York's first pizza I wouldn't stop them and I'd gladly join them.  However, I'd steer them towards Grimaldi's if they are just looking for a good brick oven pizza.",12/21/2015,112,129,612,ZHlrTv-dfChy4vLyscOdxA

We were seated right away (no line!) and ordered a small (14"" or 6 slices) Original Margherita from an unenthusiastic and slightly pushy server.The pizza was okay! The ingredients were fresh, the sauce tasted homemade, and the crust was crispy and chewy. That being said, although the pizza was tasty, it wasn't anything special and definitely not worth the $21.50 price tag. Sure, we could've opted for additional toppings, but from what I've seen at other tables, the kitchen is pretty stingy with the toppings (while charging $3-$5 per topping!).Overall, my feelings about this place are mixed.

(Katz's deli was about a 2 hour wait so we opted for this instead) Our table was in the back and we went through a maze of rooms to get there. We went with the standard small pizza to share. The pizza was a bit burnt and just average at best compared to any pizza shop ive experienced. The reason Lombaris drops from a 3 star to 2 stars is the pricing. $7 for a yuengling? Even for NY this is outrageous. $2.50 for a soft drink? Not bad until you see that they refuse to do any refills for free even though they have a fountain soda machine.

1397,Michael P.,0,2,Tourist trap not worth bothering with. Pizza was just OK lacked enough cheese the sauce was flat and dull the crust was like a cracker.

1398,Peter K.,1,5,"The absolute original legend! Literally the first pizza parlor in this country, and really the first pizza for what we know it to be now. The pizza from Naples is a whole different animal. It all stared here in the heart of Little Italy. And is still going strong now. If you love pizza, then you must come here. If you claim to be a real New Yorker then you must come here. If you just want to experience history and have some great food, come here. The pizza is outstanding. Made in the traditional way, like only few others still do, with basil, gobs of great sauce, and chunks of melted cheese straight out of the coal oven. This place is world famous and extremely popular, so expect a wait. But it's worth it.",12/3/2015,81,1124,48,BDjiEmXljD2ZHT61Iv9rrQ
1399,Mariko M.,0,2,"If you're looking to taste some of the best pizza NYC has to offer, I would skip Lombardi's and save your tummy for other pizza places that are within a short walking distance. My first clue that Lombardi's would be a disappointment was when I looked at the menu and saw a gimmicky pizza named after TLC's Cake Boss. We stayed clear of that pizza and instead ordered the original margherita pizza, with hopes that at least the original may redeem the place. However, the sauce was very generic tasting, the crust was crispy but had no depth, and the cheese and basil on top didn't add much to the overall flavor. The pizza was also pretty pricey compared to the quality slices you could get nearby. Overall, very disappointing.",2/12/2018,0,9,0,75dvQt5CNGW3Q6AY9_wNRw
1400,Erik G.,0,4,"The four of us ordered the ""Large"" size which worked out to 2 large slices for each of us.  We had a ""half-white"" and ""half pepperoni"" which had a wonderful brick-oven char to the chewy moist crust.  I'd say this was one  of the better/best pizzas I've had particularly in the chewy/crust category. Service was attentive and we only waited 5 minutes for a table during our mid-week pre-Thanksgiving lunch visit.  The restaurant is small but it does have a downstairs dining area in addition to the full bar and handful of table tops on street level.  The pizza was made quickly and arrived at our table no more than 10-12 minute wait time at our table. Remember to bring Cash as it's ""cash only"".    Located in Nolita on Spring St. you can arrive by Subway and walk over.   I like that it is the ""first pizzeria"" in America.  This is where it all started apparently and that bit of history lends to it's authenticity of quality of the food.  Well done Lombardis!

Perhaps they were having an off day, but charging $30 for a small pizza doesn't afford them (or me) to have an off day. Had ""wild"" (looks like white button to me) mushrooms and half pepperoni. Why they charge full price for only half the side and seem to give even less portions than full, I do not know. The pizza was also very flimsy and lacking any texture. I love thin pizza, and I really only eat thin pizza, but this time's pizza was a joke. Had I paid $10, fine, but charging three times that? Me thinks not. Friendly takeout service, but doesn't make up for the crappy pizza. I've had better in the mall.And a 1-star review may seem harsh, but so is their high prices and bad-tasting pizza.

The pizza was very balanced, very traditional.Bring a date or a friend because you cannot order by the slice.They are cash only which I hate, but as I have discovered, that is pretty common in NYC restaurants.Flavor was very even. By modern standards it doesn't compete with all these takes and exotic variations on pizzas.It was pretty expensive. The crust was so crisp that it cut up the roof of my mouth and it is pretty raw. I guess you could blame me but I certainly didn't do it intentionally.

1426,Tobias N.,0,3,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza. Actually, I would go so far to say that in all my years of travelling, I've only come across three pizzerias that get 100% of the components right: Tiramisu in Santiago de Chile, La Pizzeria in Campbell, CA and Da Napoli in my hometown Mannheim in Germany. But I digress...So after showing my parents Little Italy, we decided to go to Lombardi's for lunch. Wait for our party of 4 was 40 minutes (on New Year's Day around 3:30) - I guess still acceptable for New York standards (luckily, we could wait inside). It took a couple of minutes until our waitress showed up, who was very pleasant. We decided on two pizzas: one margarita (""red"") with pepperoni and one white with pancetta. Both were delivered relatively fast (15 min) and hot.As other reviewers have pointed out, the strong side of Lombardi's is definitely the crust and dough: Quite thin, chewy and slightly burned on the edges. The red one was definitely more flavorful, although they were a bit stingy on the salami pieces - on the whole pizza maybe 10 slices in total (they use these small pieces typical for American pizzas, not the larger salami you would find on ""authentic"" Italian pizzas.) The white pizza was very ""mild"" - not to say bland - and consisted mainly of cheese. They had put some pieces of pancetta, but it was not salty enough for my taste.Each pizza was around $25 plus another $4 for the meats. Given the small amount of pepperoni/pancetta they put on, certainly not cheap, but still okay. Together with drinks, tax and tip we ended up spending around $100 for four persons. Atmosphere is very authentic and service was good (cash only as others pointed out).So does Lombardi's pizza live up to the hype and justify a 40 min wait? Probably not, but it's one of the better options when you're in the area.",1/1/2015,3,6,17,VS-B1nyMyDgdDQwn71HFSQ

1435,Angel S.,1,3,"""You never forget your first,"" they say, which apparently also rings true for pizzerias.  And how could you, when seemingly every corner of Lombardi's reminds you that this is the first pizzeria in the birth place of American pizza.America's first..yes.  The best?  Well, I beg to differ. My experience fell disappointingly short.  The toppings were delightful, but the cheese was slightly bland, the sauce pretty mild in flavor and the crust was inconsistent, with some parts soggy and other parts a little bit tough.  The crust was just not crispy enough (or at all) and some parts were even floppier than Vlade Divac.  Add to that the annoyingly overzealous effort by its wait staff to get us out of there.  As soon as a plate went empty, someone swooped in to take it away.  Efficient, perhaps, except that on one occasion, I still had a quarter of my slice left and it seemed like the check was delivered by a ninja who landed on our table merely seconds after my daughter took the last slice.  I understand there were people waiting outside, but it was not as if we were sitting there endlessly debating current events like the ladies from The View.  The rush just came off like they cared more about the folks waiting for the table than the folks who waited for the table.  The ""cash only"" policy is downright annoying.   And shady.  I guess they want to sell $30 pizzas and expect patrons to carry the cash for food, drinks, and tip, like 1993.  Most likely, people will fall short - that's where their ATM machine supposedly comes in ""for your convenience,"" along with a $3 surcharge which will go the ATM owner...yep, Lombardi's.  Sorry for the rant, but I'm having trouble supporting this.Overall, the pizza was good, but no way the ""Best Pizza on the Planet"" as supposedly declared by Zagat, unless they were talking about a different planet.",9/18/2011,1540,804,1488,pypZb3V5TXHOnlTj-qLSrw

Honestly, it wasn't like the best pizza ever. It tasted ""classic"" and was very tasty. I know they used coal ovens so it's made in a traditional way--I think this is the real reason I am giving good rating. You really can't beat tradition, especially at a yummy established pizza joint in Little Italy NYC.Basically, the pizza will be tasty and you can bet you're getting fresh/authentic ingredients, but it may not be ""the most amazing pizza"" you ever had. I would say however, that for a classic pizza, this should rank high in your book.It's for sure worth coming here for historical and hunger-solving reasons.

1442,Great Cube Escape G.,0,4,"W​e were in the Nolita area and decided to try some pizza at Lombardi'sAt first we just wanted to grab a slice and go, but found out this was a sit-down restaurant which would work too. We were directed to one of their back rooms which was fun to get to because we had to go through the kitchen to find our seat.When we were walking through the tables, the pizza was not what I was expecting. At this point in the trip we had not had New York Style Pizza and I was expecting a huge thin pizza where we could fold the slices. Once I started reading the menu it turned out the pizza is cooked with a coal oven. There is definitely nothing wrong with this, but if you want to be able to fold your slice then this won't really work.Shelly and I split a pepperoni which had a great crust from the coal and excellent mozzarella. Our mouths let us know the next morning that we ate the pizza too soon because our mouths were burnt up top.The décor in the place was nice and reasonably priced for the area. If you want a New York Style pizza than I would suggest Patzeria, but if you just want a good pizza than Lombardi's is a great choice.(After researching this pizza place after our trip I found out that Lombardi's was actually America's First Pizzeria and has been in business for over 100 years)If anything, that has to say something about this place.For more information and pictures check out our site : thegreatcubeescape.com",7/22/2015,0,41,89,Hu3vribBa9WIBqwIk3mo4Q
1443,Tammy K.,1,4,"When we have visitors, we always take them to Lombardi's for the cliche, but oh so fun NYC pizza experience (Grimaldi's sucks!). We typically go during the off-hours, off-season (4 or 5pm, late Fall or Winter), and have never waited more than 20 minutes.For those who don't care for the restaurant experience, let me let you in on my dirty little secret: Take-out Lombardi calzones with spinach, ricotta, and garlic. It's pretty much the best thing since sliced bread. The calzone is dense enough to stay piping hot, even after you get home, AND you don't need to wait!",11/23/2013,71,226,19,0EwPOQQOFkmkRV07zyUFWw

We shared a small pizza half red half white. Both portions had pepperoni and olives. Now these aren't black olives these are kalamata olives! The flavors melded so we together! The Caesar salad we ordered was a great addition. I can see why it's such a landmark piece of NYC.,7/19/2017,213,9,3,WOvIZL5TfB2GCxhfdiFHmQ

I ordered a pizza with no topics on one side and meatballs and pepperoni on the other. Before I dig into the pizza I have to say the toppings by themselves were amazing and once combined with the pizza I knew this was my new favorite Pizza spot. The pizza was cooked just right and my waiter was friendly and I had no issues with staff. If you do plan on coming keep in mind sometimes there is a wait, and you can only order pies of pizzas not individual slices, and they are a cash only place .",7/18/2016,1,8,1,L_Jo4UeeFpZuRIdLvWaaRQ

1452,Kim B.,1,3,"Being in NYC, we needed to get our pizza fix. It's something NYC is known for, and frankly, I love my pizza. So I wanted to make sure to try the best pizza around. After researching on yelp, we found Lombardi's, because it was ""famous"", ""the place to go"", aka ""touristy"". We soon learned that touristy wasn't necessarily good, and that next time I would have rather found the hole in the wall ""Best pizza in NYC"".On a snowy, cold, windy night we stumbled around NYC and into Lombardi's. It feels like a family style, pizza place. It has pictures of all the celebrities that have been there, red plaid picnic tables, and lots of Italians yelling Italian things. The decor is true Italian, and makes you feel like your visiting your crazy Italian uncle. There is exposed brick, painted walls, small rooms. But The place itself is huge, and is a confusing, windy maze. Fortunately, we were able to be seated right away, and were taken back and around, around again, through the kitchen to our seats. We got pretty loose the night before, so no one but me got drinks (Spring break 15!!). Given my picky eating, we couldn't really split as many apps as we wanted. So we got the breadsticks, I got the marghartia pizza, and i forgot what the boys got. Given the price of the pizzas, we were let down. The pizza wasn't ""that "" good and it just wasn't worth all the hype that we were expecting. We felt like we had walked down the path of tourism, and got stuck in the allure of somewhere ""famous"". Maybe it was our hangover, maybe it was the cold night, but the pizza just didn't do it for us.",8/24/2015,341,769,144,pN7qHvZUKtVzwFfWx65-4A
1453,Pauline T.,1,5,"A must try if visiting NYC! I thought the $2 slices that you get from a quick hole in the wall en route to the subway can not be beat, but man does Lombardi's make a good pie! All the ingredients were fresh, the crust was crispy and not too thin and the hint of sourdough made all the flavors compliment each other! I admit it is on the pricier side but you are paying for quality food and a piece of history. It's the very first pizza joint in the states! Beat that!!",6/19/2014,129,286,163,DhFSh5r6BqEgwg8QbYVroA

My friends said they preferred the red sauce.I would definitely come back here. Not the best for large groups, unless I missed some huge rear dining hall.

Granted we had been walking 10 miles that day and were totally famished! But we love and know good pizza and we were really pleased with our experience here. Service was friendly and quick. Crust was a perfect consistency. Very nice and thin without being too crunchy or dry. Excellent place. To those complaining about cash or paper plates.... I just feel like it's not a big deal?

Well I must say the pizza was delicious!  I ordered the classic large Margharita with pepperoni and mushrooms. Down side you have to pay extra for the toppings. So $30 for 1 large pizza.

This time, arriving at noon on a recent Sunday, there was no wait, and the host and waiter were very friendly, and the once again the pizza was top-notch.Decor is so authentically shabby, that it's actually hip, and the menu is very simple, but we always stick with the pizza anyway. If you're from way out of town and your idea of good pizza is a stuffed crust and free refills (I saw a comment about no free refills on soda, which I don't understand why anyone would expect that), this is still definitely worth the trip and cost for some quality pizza in a historic setting.",10/4/2015,4,59,10,QEr-aCrrInqMnt9q7hAI-g

Amazing.As we walked in, we were asked if we wanted to be seated in the front or back. Either one worked for us, we were noobs. I'm glad we were brought into the back because we got a quick walk through the kitchen, I was like a kid in a candy store. This is a must eat in terms of food tourism.

1462,Sean K.,0,3,"I sorta had high hopes for this place due to the hype. I have mixed feelings.Had a small margherita pizza and added panchetta. Also got the Italian Soda with raspberry flavor. The soda was good overall, but did cost $3.50.The pizza itself is of good quality. A very nice, crisp thin crust with a great amount of cheese, and the panchetta was a good choice. The sauce also complemented everything well. Service wasn't outstanding, but I also didn't have a bad experience either.Here's the issues I have with this place: business practices. Maybe I'm not a native New Yorker, but I feel this place is a tourist trap. My small (14"") pizza cost over $20 before adding toppings? That's a bit expensive for what you get. Again, the pizza is good, but I don't think it's that good.But the other thing is: no credit or debit cards accepted. I have heard that other places in NYC are the same way, but let's face it; it's 2015. I don't understand how you can't accept cards these days in a sit down restaurant. They do have an ATM on-site, but it's one of those typical ones that charges $3-4 for a transaction on top. What's the issue with accepting cards? Is it the fees that MasterCard, Visa, etc. add to transactions? For such high-priced food, this shouldn't be an issue. But if it is, why not just add a 50 cent or $1 surcharge for using a card? That's a reasonable compromise in my opinion.Good pizza, high prices, not so good business practices. That's my views on this. It's 2015. Get with the program.",9/11/2015,6,54,0,WYGRamOFpgBbBgAWCPa5ZQ

If you're visiting the area, you have to go. When you eat there, you won't be disappointed either. My boyfriend and I ordered a large pizza with pancetta. When it came out, we both looked at eachother and said ""We couldn't have gone with a small"". The thing looked insurmountable - but we defeated the foe! Every last bite of the pizza was happily eaten. The crust was dynamite - nice and crunchy with a good bit of chew. The sauce was sweet and savory, and the cheese nice and fresh. It doesn't look like there is much basil on the pizza (few strips here and there) but the flavor of basil is undeniable in every bite!What impressed both of us most was that there wasn't any grease dripping off of the pizza. We both looked down at our plates, as we folded a slice in half to take a bite....Nothing! No grease dripping from the tip of the slice...no grease on the plate. That is mind-boggling to me! So awesome! A testament to the flavor of the food and the quality of the ingredients (at least I think that is what it means haha).If you've never been - go.

1469,Steve N.,1,5,"Located in the back streets of New York City's Chinatown, you can find Lombardi's, which is seriously the definition of New York pizza. To describe it, the pizza was light, the crust was crisp and the toppings were incredible. I say incredible because they literally taste like they were just freshly cut and cooked. This was pizza as it is supposed to be - and for good reason. We ordered a small pizza with four toppings: red onions, fresh pepperoni, garlic mushrooms, and peppers. From what I heard about this place on the Food Network channel, it was highly recommended that you should make it one of your stops if ever you are in the area. If you read up on the reviews and the history about it on their website or their menus, you can tell that Lombardi's carries a proud tradition to their name. This is the birthplace of American pizza places. In 1905, Lombardi's was the first place - ever - licensed as a pizzeria. Over 100 years later and it's still well worth a visit.",12/23/2015,1083,1039,1651,rGyxhmfO0lvOHswUndr0xQ

And then came a very easy decision.I had to go with the Margarita Pizza. There really was no way around it, I felt that it was just the right thing to do as its their staple pie. You have a few different options but I wasn't going to stray away from what they recommend. What came out was a fresh amazing pizza. It really was something that I would of gone back for multiple times but I had other places on my agenda. Fresh was the key here paired with that fantastic crust. All around a great experience and I think this is a must stop if your are visiting NYC. Man that crust is good I with I was their right now but I am yelping from So Cal.

We ordered a medium pizza of Margarita Pizza with added Wild Mushrooms. It was delicious! But I have to say, service sucked. Our waitress was very rude, and I think the pizza was well over charged, $20 for a medium - are you crazy? Three stars sounds more than reasonable.",6/11/2016Previous review,159,460,1112,v0vfLcau_a0vL9vbM7erXw
1486,Rayhanah A.,0,5,"I went to this restaurant in April and got the Margherita pizza pie  and Oh.My.Gosh..... it was heaven in my mouth! The service was perfect as well! I suggest that if you're visiting NY, that you stop by Lombardi's. I wouldn't suggest going on a weekend or around dinner time though, it's rather hectic then. lol",5/10/2014,106,5,24,nBwv-FkWH9Miz9jsFsAEKA
1487,Marc G.,1,3,"2 1/2 stars!  I'm being nice.  Why, I don't know...So... after eating at John's a few days before I realized two things... One... John's is a better pie... and two... I do not need to come back here.  We were seated without a wait, which was nice, but wound up being taken to the mysterious off shoot a few doors down... The place was freezing and we were seated right under the fan... Not to sound like my mother, but...The pizza is good, don't get me wrong... nice crust, chewy in the right places, charred in the right places... Well, a few burned spots on the bottom... but my biggest gripe is that they charge PER Iced Tea!!!  This is bad enough, but the glasses are small and they don't bother to tell you that they charge PER Iced Tea.  Who does that?  It costs you pennies and you are charging me $3 a glass.  Come on... Things like that just burn me... as you can now tell.Yes, I know... I have not lived in NYC is a long, long time... the city is pricey... Blah, blah, blah... But this would have been a nice thing to point out, especially when my daughter did not even finish her refill.  That's all... Better pizza elsewhere... and so many great options to choose from.  One and out... Won't be back... Thank you.",9/20/2015,101,324,27,i5Wp2ZRBX4Pf4afScGqfrA

1490,Sam Y.,0,3,"Over 3000 reviews and four stars? That's gotta say something, right?I had been wanting to try Lombardi's since I saw them featured on the Food Network (I think it was Food Paradise). I love pizza and am always ready to try any place that people say is good.We were kind of in a hurry, and there was over an hour wait to be seated, so we decided to get a pizza to go.We settled on the original pizza which consists of just sauce, mozzarella and basil. It was good (the ingredients seemed to be very fresh), but it wasn't mind-blowing. The crust is pretty thin and the pizza was fairly large, but nothing really stood out. And it is kind of over-priced for what it is. A large pie with no additional toppings will cost you $21.50 plus tax. I think this is another case of people paying big bucks just for the name of the place.",2/9/2016,227,122,220,v-Pvqqw0wHuIExRPG78Pkw
1491,Vivek D.,1,4,"Went here for the first time about a year ago, mainly because of its history as the first pizzeria in NYC.  Must say, the food didn't disappoint.  Got the margherita pizza and was impressed.  Crust was good & pizza was well cooked.Only two reasons why I didn't give it a perfect rating: 1)  The place accepts cash only2)  To be quite honest, was never a huge fan of margherita pizzas.  I'm from NJ, so when I think of pizza, I think of either one of the chains (Papa Johns, Dominos, Little Caesars), Singas Famous Pizza, or the slice or two of NY Pizza around the corner for $3 everywhere here.  I like NY pizza.... never fell in love with Margherita Pizzas.But point 2 is not a knock against Lombardi's, but rather just personal preference.",1/8/2014,149,282,155,w4WwnpmfYtq3aWCYd2wJIQ

This place is the first pizzeria of America, and is known for its use of coal oven to make pizza. I ordered a clam pie pizza, which came in 1 size, 6 pieces, enough for 3 people. The pizza was not dried and greasy like those in Domino or Hut. It was a high class pizza with lots of clam, mushroom, and a fresh lemon in case you want something juicy.

Do not expect Midwest prices...or else you will be sorely disappointed. A small pizza (14"") with pepperoni is $25. It was a good pizza...but I can get the same wood fired oven pizza with Italian flour for $12. Having said that...you are in NYC. Gotta find something local...and this is a good option.

Thank you Grimaldi's for getting it right. Opps. Wrong review.Came after a snowstorm the day after Christmas.Yes. There still was a line.60 minute wait inside in the periphery of the first floor, glaring at the tourists taking their sweet ass time, eating fresh delicious gooey pizza.Yes. I was starving and was about to go gansta on someone if they didn't hurry the hell up.When we were seated, it was downstairs in the wine cellar. We immediately ordered a clam pie and margarita pie. The clam pie arrived first, piping hot, generous with clams and befitting with the white sauce. The margarita pie had fresh ingredients and clean taste, thin oven charred crust. The sauce was tad sweeter than Grimaldi's. For me, this pizza did not trump Grimaldi's. The ranking goes: Grimaldi's, Artichoke's Sicilian, Lombardi's clam pie, Joe's, Lombardi's margarita. Of course this depends on multiple factors but that's my take on it.I will be back if I am in Soho.",10/7/2011,1229,1043,7313,Dq_Jkpx4xpbh4iofayOr6g

1504,J J.,0,5,"Inn born and raised in NYC and if there's one thing I've learned over the years is that pizza, probably more than any other food, just ahead of bagels, is thee most subjective food than any other. It's more than just New York vs Chicago, or what toppings should be on the pie. This debate comes down to subtle aspects of the slice. Thin or thick? Sweet sauce? Lots of cheese or just enough? Crispy or chewy. The list is long. For me personally, it doesn't get much better than the pie I had the other day at Lombardi's. Ultra thin, crispy, fresh tomatoes, slightly sweet, fresh mozzarella, and tasty meatballs. My only complaint was the coverage of the meatballs... Just not quite enough. Some slices had three pieces of meat, others only one. A minor flaw. It had been forever since I was there. Lombardi's continues to live up to its reputation. Some might say its just a tourist spot. Cliche New York. Lots of tourists for sure, but so what? As a New Yorker I had no hesitation about being seen there.",1/30/2016,15,34,12,zXBuxuAzkZQBq8sXtj3pzA

Finally it was our turn! The host took us to a whole different side like 2 doors down. What the... I guess that's how New York works! Anyway, it looks like the typical Italian restaurant with the red plaid table cloth. We got a large pizza with customized toppings. Meatball, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and garlic sautéed spinach. Food came out fairly quick and it smelled great!! The pizza was hugeeee. Crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it. You can tell the sauce was really fresh because I can taste the tomatoes, not those other sauces that tastes like tomato paste. The meatballs were soft, pepperoni was my favorite because it was thinly sliced and it didn't taste like the ones you would get at the chain pizza places. Roasted red peppers and spinach balanced out all that meat. It was so good and one slice got me full because it was gigantic! Definitely worth the wait.",11/13/2013,287,170,188,8DnBMIfDWnR5kI9nLwl4Hg

The additional toppings are $4 each (one topping)! It's a bit over priced and I don't think the pizzas are as good as what people are saying here.

The crust is thin and chewy but I found it tough rather than crispy. The toppings are very average. Mozzarella cheese is fresh but the basil flavor is mellow. I think the basil leaves were chopped too fine and lost too much of its lovely fragrant. Definitely not one of the better Margarita pizza I have had. Perhaps I was too spoiled by the authentic Italian thin crust artisan pizzas made with finer ingredients. Despite what people say about west coast pizza, I could still easily name 5 restaurants in San Francisco Bay area that serve better thin crust pizzas than Lombardi. I am not convinced this is really what NYC could offer. Next time around I will research more for a better pizzeria. Suggestions welcome.",7/15/2011,1398,1275,9905,41HLwXnR0Lm3NUp01cIOQg

The price for a small pizza and a pitcher of soda was $38.00 without tip. Walking down the strip in little Italy I was looking at all the nice places with awesome dishes being served. I decided upon Lombardis because of the good reviews. I was overall disappointed in the quality of food compared with the price. If you want over priced pizza then this is the spot!

The opportunity to eat at ""the original"" pizzeria was just too good to pass up.  I don't know if it truly is ""the original"", but it sure made a tasty pie!If you're planning a visit, expect to wait for a few minutes to get a table. The rest of the city seems to know the real deal when they see it so they come out in droves to get some (plus there's all the tourists). The tables are pretty much on top of one another with the way they space people apart, but it works because you don't really talk much once you start eating.I'm not going to try and embellish upon what Lombardi's does well; it's simply pizza, but it's a damp good pizza. The crust is crispy and not too thick, while the cheese and toppings are nicely spaced on top of the pizza. Two main things I noticed throughout the meal: 1. The taste of fresh basil is prominent with each bite, 2. No grease! I attribute the latter to REAL ingredients that aren't laden with fat and oils.

1535,Kevin W.,1,5,"I won't go out of my way to proclaim this place the best pizza joint in NYC.  That's just unrealistic.  NYC Pizza, like abortion and gay marriage, is a touchy subject and the cause of much debate.   I will save you all of that.  I will explain why this is my personal favorite instead.First off - what makes this place awesome for me is the wonderfully fresh ingredients they use.  Like all restaurants (or other types of businesses for that matter) that use good, quality materials - you can totally taste the difference.  I always go for my simple go to pie - their delicious and distinctively tasty pepperoni pizza.  Maybe it's because I usually come here after a 50 mile bike ride, but the pizza is so good I usually can inhale an entire medium pie myself, or a large pie with the help of a friend.What makes it taste so good to me is the freshness of the cheese, the tastiness of the pepperoni, the savory fresh tomato sauce and the light, simple crust.  Can't go wrong with this wonderful formula for pizza heaven.Either case, it's always a pleasure to come here, even if the crowds can get big, the tourists can get annoying and the parking is a bitch.",5/15/2013,1292,754,1141,rm92EiaA7h5lLbAK5dJKcw

1544,Candy R.,0,5,"Have a slice of history! If you're in the city and around Little Italy/Chinatown area you definitely have to stop here! Be ready to wait a while since it is a tourist attraction and gets packed! I only had to wait about 30 minutes so it wasn't that bad. Once inside, I got seated at a table that was right next to the entrance and next to the bar - it got annoying sitting there because you could experience the chaos between the employees and the rowdy customers. Nonetheless, I wasn't about to leave after I had been waiting a while outside. The restaurant was beautiful and had brick infused walls with a lot of pictures featuring, John Brescio, the owner, as well as plenty of awards.The waitress came with my menu and I quickly realized they only accept cash. So, F.Y.I. - CASH ONLY! I ordered a large, half original and half white pizza. The original consisted of a base of a San Marzano tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella topped with romano and fresh basil, it was so delicious and the San Marzano sauce was divine! The White Pizza was sauce free and based with garlic infused oil topped with mozzarella, ricotta, and romano cheese, as well as oregano, basil, and black pepper. I honestly liked both of the thin crust pizzas, but I liked the white pizza a little bit better. The ricotta was so pretty that I didn't want to eat it... but I did! I would recommend trying both. I plan to go back and try their pepperoni pizza! Mind you, all these pizzas are still made in their original coal fired oven dated 1905. The restaurant is located on the corner of Spring and Mott Street - you can't miss it as you will notice that ""Mona Lisa"" is waiting for you.Remember to, ""smile, you're at Lombardi's.""",5/8/2013,680,141,1521,6Fkn2cT6lqNPRQZhXnh-NQ

1548,Jason F.,0,1,"First time in NYC so I made my way to the city's most reviewed pizza restaurant. I don't care if you are ""America's First Pizzeria,"" I only care about taste. Sorry to say, this joint has terrible pizza. I ordered a large half margherita, half white pizza with meatballs ($31.50+t&t). The sauce has no ""zing"" or ""kick"" and really tastes like just tomatoes, which would be fine if the rest of the pizza had some seasoning. But instead, the crust is flavorless and not enough basil was thrown on top. The white half was a little better with the ricotta giving it some saltiness and herbs for flavor but again unimpressive. The meatball was nice but nothing to rave about.The service was fine even though they did bring me out the wrong order at first. They fixed it without any hesitation and that's all anyone can really ask for. Maybe I'm spoiled from years and years of truly creative pizza from all around California, but when you can't even better my around-the-corner-pizzeria at making pies then something's terribly wrong. Do yourself a favor and check online for a list of NYC's best pizza...check out Thrillist for a comprehensive list. You'll see that Lombardi's isn't even ranked (and for good reason). Final thoughts: absolutely not worth it in terms of price or, more importantly, time. If your here visiting, spend your vacation visiting some of NYC's truly great pizza and not here.

1550,Ryan K.,0,5,"Every time I'm in Brooklyn, I stop by Grimaldi's to get a slice, and every time I'm in Manhattan I get a table and a pie at Lombardi's. Century-old Lombardi's is an archetype of true New York style Pizza. It's always crowded, the tables are packed together like sardines (anchovies?) and sometimes you'll wait 2+ hours to get a table on weekends. But hey, their pizza is amazing so it's all worth it. As far as NYC experiences go, you can't beat a game at The Garden and then a pepperoni pie at Lombardi's. If the Knicks win, then you're golden.The restaurant itself is beautiful. It still resides in it's original building, on the edge of Little Italy. It's cozy and authentic, with aged exposed brick walls, early Deco lighting, and the tables are topped with checkered table clothes.If you go on an off night, they'll burn your pie or give you some overly puffy crust, but when they get it right, there's no better NY style pizza in the world. I usually get the The Original plain or with pepperoni and nothing else. Their pies are made with rich and creamy buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, romano and opulent San Marzano tomato sauce.The atmosphere is lively, cozy and social and the restaurant is part of NY heritage.

1554,Randy H.,0,5,"Coal Fired Pizza PerfectionWhen you walk thru the front door you can feel the history. Lombardi's has been around since 1897. This place has rightfully earned the title of ""First Pizzeria in the United States""Today a friend (and fellow Yelper) and I decided to step out for a well-deserved slice. As we enter Lombardi's we're immediately welcomed by the owner of the establishment (couldn't help recognizing him from the pictures on the wall). The reputation of Lombardi's was the driving force for our lunch decision. The photos posted on Yelp only further fueled the desire to eat here. The prices are very competitive. We ordered a small (16"") pie for $16.50. Topping were an additional $3.00 each. Let me tell you the decision on topping choice was not an easy one. I had my heart set on the homemade meatballs, they use pork in the meatballs for extra flavor. We also added Wild fresh mushrooms, mmm, delicious. Regrettably, I didn't add on the Roasted Red Peppers. My friend had said they were roasted fresh daily and tried them on a prior takeout order. I'm seriously considering the sweet Italian sausage or Citterio pancetta for topping on a future visit. Seriously, pancetta? What an awesome idea. The pie was delivered to the table with 10 minutes. Piping hot, slightly charred crust, just what you would expect from a decent coal fired pizza. The mozzarella was thinly sliced and placed on a fine layer of tomato sauce.  Add on a few spices, the balls (cut in half), and the mushrooms and you've got one hell of a dish. The small pie is cut into six slices and is more than enough for two. I can only imagine it would take three or more hungry people to take on the larger 18"" pie.The wait staff was very prompt and friendly. My friend and I were seated very comfortably at a table for 4 with plenty of room around us. I've been to other restaurants in Little Italy where you're also sitting on top of the people around you. Lombardi's is comfortable. Unfortunately, and I do mean unfortunately, we were on a lunch break from work so we didn't partake in the selection of tap beers or even better sangria. The menu boasts about the notoriety of this place on the Food Network, the Discovery Channel, and even the History Channel. There's a good reason for that. This place carries a reputation that they are legendary. And I'd like to add, that's a well deserved reputation. This one goes on my must return (regularly) list.Be prepared, it's cash only.",4/24/2013,711,220,878,dnCE0O3DvsmxBysa-TdYRA

The amount of cheese and sauce they put in it is just perfect; they'll melt in your mouth. The crust is very crispy  and the basil is the finishing touch. The ingredients are top notch; it's probably my favorite thin crust pizza.I also tried the Italian Sausage; it's pretty good. The meat's very flavorful, but I still like their Margarita better. The place's usually packed here, so you might have to wait for awhile. The price isn't bad, especially since the pizza's huge (order the large!!!).

Strange thing that if you order a topping on half the pizza, you still pay the full price for the topping! So a half mushroom, half red pepper small pizza will run you over $30 bucks before tax/tip.

So if you are traveling alone and was unaware of this fact and came all the way down here just for Lombardi's so it doesnt make sense to be deterred, you will feel rather silly sitting down with a huge pie of pizza all to yourself. A small is $16, comes with 6 or 8 slices, I cant remember. Extra couple bucks for extra toppings. The crust was SUPER thin, but still managed to be crispy/chewy and substantial. The hot melty cheese slides off. I suggest the meatball topping. All in all, yes make your way over here if you are on a touristy NYC vacation.

The pizza was super soggy and didn't taste like anything special. We ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day before going to the Met and it was the soggiest leftover pizza I've ever had.

1566,Steven N.,0,2,"Very overrated unfortunately. My first taste of New York pizza and I was underwhelmed pretty quickly. First off, the place is overpriced, by far the most expensive pizza I've ever had. We got a large white pizza and even without any toppings on it, it'd be $26. We got sausage and onions which cost $7-8 to add on. So this large pizza is already $33 with just two toppings, not including gratuity. Plus the place is cash only. Great...The first slice of the pizza was interesting and not bad. The sausage was good and the cheese on it is definitely different. It's almost like it was whipped and shaped like whip cream on a pie. The cheese tasted airy and takes some getting used to. After the first slice, me and my girlfriend were scraping off the cheese chunks because it was so overwhelming. We scraped off about 50% of it because it was too much and kind of ruined the taste of the pizza. It was nice to try such a historic place but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",6/23/2015,182,141,8,k_nJoDBMcF2I3mQo8_NQQA
1567,Sellina Y.,1,3,"My second trip to NY was nearly 4 years ago, and then was the first time I had pizza at this so call place with the BEST pizza!!!! I really did not understand why this pizza place had a line equivalent to those during Black Friday sales, the day after Thanksgiving Day.SO what can you do when you are waiting in line for a hour? Well you chat with ur gang to kill time, people watch (i get a good kick with all the open top tour buses passing by and stopping for a few seconds so that the tourists on the bus can take pics of the tourists waiting in line for a pizza pie), or complain about how ridiculously humid it is in NY during the summer time- so this wait better be worth it!!!!! Until today i still do not understand why this place is so great!!!! Maybe I should read other yelper's reviews in this hot joint. My second trip to this place was several months ago since a friend was in town and since Lombardi's pizza had relocated to a few yards up the block to the corner i figure maybe things will be better this time around. This time i traveled from New Jersey to Brooklyn (1.5 hr min. commute). and once again the line was still long, 45min-1 hr long wait.The pizza crust is rather dry, but crispy like a biscotti. The slice is thin, but still still holds up all the toppings- maybe bc there arent a whole lot of toppings to begin with?!!! Anyways, my boyfriend and I had better if not similar to the $1 slice pizzas in NYC so I do not see why I would travel so far again for pizza at Lombardi. I can use my waiting time in line for something more worthwhile.On a positive note, the service here is wonderful, I did feel welcomed the two times I visited, and the host will try conversing with you before you get seated.Now that I have relocated to the East Coast for good, my all time fave pizza joint is definately Lazzarra's pizza on 38th st between 7th and 8th ave in New York.",10/6/2013,97,59,121,r0OcTfHB8krKZlLjLpt73Q
1568,Cat G.,0,4,"My parents and sister were visiting from out of town, and we were hunting for a place to have a casual dinner on a Sunday night. We were right by Little Italy, so this should've been a laughably easy task, but I read through some Yelp reviews anyway before finding Lombardi's. I'd heard of the name before, but had never paid them a visit (indeed, I realized that I hadn't had real pizza - as in non-Domino's, non-Pizza-Hut pizza - since I moved to New York a couple of months ago.) A trip to Lombardi's remedied this travesty.On a Sunday night just before 6pm, there was very little wait for a party of 4, which was nice. The hosts at the podium seemed more interested in chatting with each other than acknowledging our existence, but we were seated quickly, so I'm not that salty about it. Slight bummer that we were seated in the basement, but I'd rather get my food more quickly than wait a longer time for a seat upstairs.Between the four of us, we ordered a large margherita, a small ""cake boss"" (prosciutto and arugula), the meatball appetizer, and a Caesar salad. This was about the right amount of food - we had three slices of the margherita leftover, which is just enough for a cold pizza breakfast the next AM. Both pizzas were delicious, though I'm not sure why the cake boss pizza is so expensive - the large (18"") margherita was about 25 dollars, and the small (14"") cake boss is 35. I enjoyed the meatballs as well (even as a person who doesn't usually like meatballs in spaghetti), and the food came out pretty quickly.Dinner for four people came out to just under $100 with tip (counting two sodas and a beer), so not cheap but also not crazy expensive. They're cash only (a bit absurd when you're selling menu items that cost $20-30), so come prepared!I wouldn't go out of my way to come back or wait a long time for a table here, but it's a solid place to check out if you're in the area!",7/20/2015,135,228,4,JMFbAUa0ksxDNIW0r8NIwA

The ingredients are fresh and it seems as though they have more space than Grimaldi's. The wait time is about the same. If anything, this place has even more tourists due to its vicinity to Little Italy and Chinatown. Good news is that while you are waiting, you can go over to Rice to Riches and get yourself an overpriced bowel of rice pudding. Don't you just love New York? It's both a time AND a money sink.I've been to Lombardi's a few more times than I have Grimaldi's and would come back to this place if I was going to dine off peak hours with friends from out of town.

I would think all the other pizza places after this would've tried to match the quality or improve but this has got to be one of the best pizzas I've had. The clam pie had soo much clam in it, a nice crisp crust and good flavor. Only downside is that this needs to be eaten fast as it's not that great anymore once it cools down. It got chewy and not so enjoyable to eat. For our other pizza, we got half red half white. I typically prefer white pizzas over red but this place was different. Although the white was good, it had nicely piped ricotta cheese and fresh mozarella, it was lacking in flavor to me. I felt that it needed more garlic or something, as it was quite plain. The red sauce pizza on the other hand was surprisingly good! The tomato sauce tasted like it was made fresh from tomatoes instead of the pureed tomato sauce a lot of places purchase. It was slightly tangy and had a genuine tomato flavor. It kept the pizza moist and soft but not soggy. The crust for both pizzas were cooked over coal and they were cooked perfectly.

1573,Adam L.,1,5,"WELL WELL WELL.... I finally get to review Lombardi's. So yeah, its a tourist trap. Yeah, there will probably be a line. I disagree with many reviews though. This along with 2 others compete easily for best pizza in NYC. From the time you walk in you immediately get a vibe of the great atmosphere. The photos of all sorts of sports stars and celebrities should tell you there's a reason everyone comes here. The mozzarella, sauce, and crust are a perfect combo. Its cash only as many have mentioned, like most of the pizzerias in NY. If youre in NY and looking for pizza Lombardis is a cant miss. Not much else to say. You will not be disappointed. One of the best pies youll ever have! The wait has never been too bad for me, and certainly nothing like Di Fara.",2/3/2014,199,466,179,6YE98FSiFViGD8kOaxLmbA
1574,Pauline P.,1,4,"Walked through Chinatown on a wet and drizzly day to get pipping hot pizza in my belly. The second I had my first bite though, I swear the clouds parted and made way for a beautiful sunny afternoon. // LOCATION // A short walk from the heart of Chinatown in what is left of Little Italy. Across the street from the ever-so-popular Rice to Riches.// AMBIANCE // Loud and bustling. The restaurant has a main dining room and then what appears to be a newer addition to the restaurant to accomodate more people.// WAIT // No wait for 2 people at 2 pm on a Thursday afternoon. Granted this may be because it was past lunch time on a weekday. // FOOD // A standard pie with meatballs, mushroom, and garlic spinach. The real winner was the spinach. This was definitely an ingredient missing from my pizza when I visited Grimaldi's the day after. It provided all this veggie goodness and gave me the false pretense of a healthy meal. The meatballs were a winner as well. After trying both Lombardi's and Grimaldi's, Lombardi's is definitely the winner in my book and the wait is much more reasonable as well.",9/24/2011,863,614,1358,U08FBOaRQCk-IAcHPAxzKA

1576,Kayla J.,0,5,"My husband and I have been here 3 times, once each trip we have made to NYC.  We absolutely love this place!!!  It was recommended by a local because it is the oldest pizzeria in the US.  Cons - CASH only.  There is an ATM nearby if needed though, just have to pay the fee.  For 2 people, it is a lot of pizza so either be hungry or ready to take leftovers to your hotel.  Pizza is on the pricier side for the amount of food you get and you have to pay per topping but with how good the pizza is, it completely makes up for it.The pizza here is amazing and even though we live close to Chicago and have done pizza tours, this is still by far our favorite pizza place!! We recommend this place to anyone we know that will be traveling to NYC.  It is conveniently located near a subway stop so easy to get to.  The bruschetta is also amazing!!!  Can't wait to take another trip to go back soon!",11/18/2015,9,73,22,BjlsPdxSpEXLKdj5vU_Thg

I had pizza from a gas station here in Utah today that left me feeling more satisfied than the pizza I had at Lombardi's.  The toppings, though individually tasty, we're severely lacking in quantity.  My 3 topping large pizza looked barren and uninspired, not the lovingly crafted opulent feast I expected after shelling out $60 for a single large pizza and three non-refillable sodas.  Do yourself a favor and just skip pizza altogether in New York City.",11/28/2017,23,3,0,zFdXnfuWu5xTfkrMsMeDYw

Is it?  No.   The ambience is nil, the pizza itself is average, at best. The prices are really ridiculous!  What do they have? An antique oven. Period. We went last week, for the last time. Clam pie was stiff and dry. You couldn't fold that slice without a mat knife. Meatballs?  Everything here is really overrated and you can do much much better.

However, the wait time (at least 30 minutes when we visited), the cash only option, and the price of the pizzas really do not make this place worth it. One large pizza with one or two added toppings costs anywhere from $30-40. Add an appetizer and you're looking at $50-60. I think that one of the few reasons that people continue to come to this place is because simply because of its history. For me however, I don't think that it would be something that I would come back to for future visits in New York.",7/23/2015,312,95,130,8nWC0YJ7EGR6uuizFQqQkQ

1585,Lolita L.,0,4,This place tends to be very popular with the tourists. The pizza is very expensive and can come out to be $40 without toppings. I suggest getting the thin crust.

Nothing was going to stop me from visiting this place in NYC. It was raining hard and we had to go across town just to get to Lombardi's. It was worth every second of it. We were very lucky to get a table right away. It was my lucky day because they sat us right next to Lombardi himself! ... well actually it was an oversize picture of the man cooking his famous pizza! We ordered the traditional but yet ever so famous Marguerita Pizza. I pictured the pizza being carried on a golden tray with a line of trumpet players playing loudly. Ok so that may seem very exaggerated, but when I took my first bite, it was definitely music to my ears and harmony in my mouth! Everything was super fresh from the sauce, to the cheese, to the dough! I usually don't eat the crust of pizzas, but I ate every single thing on that tray! Overall, this was one of the better pizzas in NYC, if not one of the best!! Oh Lombardi's I will be anxiously waiting for our next reunion together!!",4/3/2011,865,647,356,lSLxtm7Ju7-Q1k4LN6PGcg

Start with the crust: tasteless, uncrispy, almost stale, like it had been thrown hours ago, probably so. Tomato sauce with no flavor. The mossarella was good though, and unusually stringy which was the only plus, but not enough to make up for the poverty of this pie. Oh but the price was rich. And with those kinds of prices you'd think they might invest in some new upholstery for the rundown booth seating and decor. Sorry we tried this place.",6/20/2016,5,93,0,7tf5V-DDh51j-WQqBbei3Q

That doesn't bode well, but it also doesn't really call out a bad experience...so three stars seems about right. Honestly there are better places that you'll look back on fondly one day while you're telling your life story.

1595,Ben L.,1,3,"Classic, yes. Good, no so much. This might be the first pizza in America but it is not the best. Rumor has it that Lomardi and Grimaldi used to work together but clearly Grimaldi left and made the better pie. This place is one of the few places left that actually use coal ovens. Grimaldi's is still king for me for coal oven pizza.The food:The pie- I felt the dough was chewy and kinda dry. The clear winner for toppings is the pepperoni. I don't normally order pepperoni but the one they use here is excellent. The clam pie was highly recommended by a number of outlets but all the clams were really chewy and didn't have a lot of flavor.",8/30/2013,982,1017,2816,Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA
1596,Christopher K.,1,3,"Lombardi's was my favorite pizza for many years heading into the late 90s, when they suddenly changed the formula. Lombardi's doubled the size of their restaurant and turned it into a giant tourist trap, like the pizzeria version of a Planet Hollywood. And right around then the pies began to lose some of their luster. The pies today are so light on the fresh mozzarella that any given pie could have a slice or two with absolutely no cheese on it. That sucks! Just look at some of the pictures! And the toppings have gotten skimpier, too. It's all about maximizing the crust now, not the pie. Lombardi's used to be so much than what it is today. Alas, I concede... it still tastes great coming out of the oven. And if it wasn't for the great pizza competition that now exists across the five boroughs, I'd probably kick Lombardi's an extra star. But I just miss the days when the owners put more love into making the pizza than packing them in and ringing the register. It's clear that that's what it's all about now, and that's a shame.",3/31/2013,908,699,966,UU9aCh4ZN2N1nfFXAiJz_g

1600,Luna K.,0,1,"We happened to be in little Italy during a festival unbeknownst to us, so the area was packed and chaotic! After a long day we just wanted some good pizza and at a place that was not packed. We stumbled onto Lombardi's only learning when we left it was the first pizzeria. I would never have guessed it based on the quality of food. Myself and my company all ordered the calzones, grandma Grace's meatballs, bruschetta, and we all had a salad. The meatballs came to our table within 5 minutes and they were huge and luke warm. A sign to me and my table they had clearly been cooked earlier and sitting and/or reheated quickly. Gross. They tasted fine but would never order again. Salads came next and were nothing to talk about. The wedge salad was just meh, and the house salad was fine and greens seemed fresh. Bruschetta was the only good item, very flavorful.Calzones were tasteless, most of the taste coming from the sauce which was just okay. Too much ricotta, the crust had no substance. I have had lots of other better pizzas from little Italy. There are way better options of pizza in the area and even outside the area. Lastly they only take CASH. We did not see the sign on the door before we walked in due to the crowds but I feel like this should be something they tell you before you order or post more signs because one sign on the bottom of the door doesn't cut it. They also do not separate checks using the excuse ""we don't have computers"" she said while writing down everything we ordered on a piece of paper with our total. You don't have computers and only take cash fine, but if you are sitting there writing down our receipt and our order you can surely make 2 different checks. This company needs to get with the times, people use credit/debits and most certainly split checks. I would not come here for that alone.",9/25/2016,2,17,0,hFi116ZB1DY5X2wu_quQQA

We had to wait about 5-10 minutes what is more than normal too. We get a small table in the second room. The Ambiente was really cute and remembers at a classic Italien pizza place. We read the menu and we were a bit shocked how much a small pizza cost: $21.90 and a large pizza cost: $25.90For a original margarita. Each topping was $5-$6 plus. We order the large pizza with Meatballs. $31.90 !!!A normal coke cost $3 what is normal. But NO REFILL. We took some water, what was served with plastic cups.

1606,Dave A.,0,4,"Yeah, yeah, ""pizza"" originated in Naples, Italy.  BUT, we do thangs a bit different 'round here!  Real question is who owns ""FIRST Pizzeria"" title in the U.S. of A?!?  The Lombardi Family in the NYC!!!  Being avid pizza eaters, we decided to pay homage to the ones that started it all, way back in 1897.  Who cares if it's not the original site?!?!  It's still The Lombardi Family!  Best way to travel is by subway, on the Green Line 4,5,6 to Spring St. and then a short walk there.  No flashy lights like Time Square to attract your attention, just simple signs on brick & mortar.  Though, there is the SPECIAL plaque, that recognizes the significance of Lombardi's by the entry way.  It's deceiving when you FIRST walk in, because you only view a number of tables available and a bar.  Nowhere near what you'd expect with its presumed popularity.  However, as we were taken to our table, I saw the ""ant farm"" arrangement goin' on within to accommodate the masses and I got the lil ""Ahah!"" moment for the ingenuity.  Connie was our server today, and this lass wasn't frontin' the classic NYC 'tude at all!  Friendly, patient, and helpful throughout.  Shout out, Gurl!  We sampled pizzas of course!!!*ORIGINAL MARGHERITA:  Oh, this was one delicious pie!  Their red sauce has a wonderful taste to it, topped with nicely ooey gooey fresh mozzarella cheese, on the classic NYC thin crust.  We hyped it up with pepperoni & mushrooms.  Mmmm-mmm!!!  They laid the groundwork here with quality like this!  Is THIS why NYC pizza, and pizza in general in the USA, is so popular???  SERIOUSLY, because Lombardi's was THIS tasty BACK IN 1897, it blew everyone's mind, and made peeps wanna come & sink their chops into a slice OR copycat with their own shop.  The stories start & the rest is history, right? Luv it!*WHITE PIZZA:  Get a lil rumbly tummy when ya drop tomatoes down the hatch?  Then, this is your pie ;)   3 cheeses, garlic, black pepper, fresh basil, and oregano make the basic pie with NO sauce.  We added pancetta & spinach for more color.  I like that there's no Alfredo sauce here or any white colored sauce.  Good stuff!*FAMOUS CLAM PIE:  This SOUNDED interesting, but after placing our order, Connie came back with a news flash, ""Sorry, just ran out.""   Apparently, clams come Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Sauce is made fresh. So later Sunday (when we came) and Holiday Mondays may not be the best days to savor a slice of clam pie.No complaints on this visit to America's FIRST pizzeria.  A coal oven is used here and didn't  have to wait long for hot pies to land.  We were well attended to throughout our stay and never rushed to leave.  Can't hate here!  It's all good :)Just so you know: CASH ONLY!!!  There's an ATM INSIDE the restaurant, OR you can go to the market across Mott St. whose ATM INSIDE has a cheaper transaction fee.",2/21/2015,459,424,2471,ak0jYenosURg0q1SPC5nLw

1613,Tony J.,1,3,"After having both Lombardi's and Grimaldi's, I have to say Grimaldi's is superior. Both are quite good and much more similar to each other than the pizzas you get from those national pizza chains. Now for what I like better about Grimaldi's:1. Although both use fresh mozzarella, Grimaldi's puts heaps of it on your pizza, giving it a very cheesy consistency, while Lombardi's does not really use enough.2. Grimaldi's pizza is more stable. You can't really pick up a slice of either pizza immediately with your hands, but for Grimaldi's, you can cut off a bit off from the center, eat it with a fork, and then proceed to pick up the slice. For Lombardi's, I ended up just picking up my entire plate to provide support.3. The crust is more edible at Grimaldi's.4. The flavors just blend together better for Grimaldi's.5. Cheaper. Lombardi's is $16.50 for a small pie and $3 per topping, while Grimaldi's is $12 for a small pie and $2 per topping.What I like better about Lombardi's:1. Better wait scheme. At both places you can expect to wait upwards of 30 minutes. At Grimaldi's, you have to wait in line, whereas at Lombardi's, they give you a pager. So if I were coming on a hot summer day, despite all the aforementioned advantages of Grimaldi's, I would probably prefer Lombardi's.I gave Grimaldi's 4.5 stars, so I am deducting a star for quality and half a star for price and giving back half a star for the pagers.3.5 stars",8/11/2013,131,465,49,0oD7hL4ie7_cwB9gWn8AVA
1614,Imz A.,0,4,"The chunks of cheese on their white pizza are to die for.  The crust has that perfect crunch. We had no room left for dessert, or even much for drinking.  The servers are friendly and accommodating--get their advice when you order. Our waiter helped us customize our pizza, and later when my friend forgot her purse on the back of her chair, our waiter chased after us to return it! Perhaps you think that's normal--good, Lombardi's thinks so too.Go with company, because there is a significant wait while they bake. Finish your order, because it doesn't keep all that well--there are a lot of soft cheeses on the pie that aren't really made to stand up to refrigeration. The coal oven baking process leaves a few blackened portions on the underside of your crust--not a problem when it's fresh, you won't even notice then, but when you reheat, you will.  I also didn't love their margherita pizza, but that's  because I was comparing it to their white pizza, which, as I said, is positively to die for.I wouldn't rank this as must-see for a day-tripper, but it's definitely a pizza to try if you're in NYC for a few days.  If you live here, why not? It's not greasy, it's not doughy and thick, it's not the kind of pizza you've grown used to saying ""No"" to for your health. If you're in the mood for some pizza innovation, a real dining experience, and one of the distinctive flavors of the city, GO, GO, GO.",9/13/2013,1,26,7,_5Ru-u52PRQFiI2GCizJTA

I have no idea if they even have anything but Pizza, I admit I have forgot but really who cares. This is the margherita pie from heaven. From the cheese to the delicious sauce and tasty dough it is the perfect chemistry.I have got it delivered and it's not AS good as fresh out oven but it's still a bonus for anyone that lives close by.

The toppings are a little expensive ($3-$5 each), but the pizza is really tasty! The total cost was about $31 (cash only!), which is a little more than some other places, but still reasonable.

I would have taken them to Grimaldi's, but we were trying to stay in Manhattan for the day. Wait was about 15 minutes Saturday a little before noon, but they wouldn't give us a buzzer till we were all there. We ordered a small margherita pizza and a small clam pie. My uncle arrived, making our table a party of five, so we had to move tables. Our server was so nice and made sure we got a bigger table as another party was leaving. The clam pie looked dry, and I was told it was very cracker-like in texture. I don't think anyone liked it. And at $30 a pie, no one thought it was worthwhile. The margherita was okay - I also found the crust a little too thin and crisp. Maybe we just got a bad couple of pies, but we did end up ordering another small and they were all pretty similar. I have to say that the margherita we ordered at Smorgasburg (from a portable coal oven!!) and the slices we got at Pizza by Cer Te in Midtown East (found it on yelp) were infinitely better.Come here for the ""history"" and the name, but you can definitely find better pie somewhere else.",11/13/2013Updated review,371,964,730,LEGudhGQU2sBvpyltEov1g

I was surprised to find that our wait was less than 30 minutes, which was pretty awesome, given how popular this place is. However....To start, we got the bruchetta. Not very great. I'm a HUGE tomato fan, so I definitely loved that they overloaded each slice of bread with tomatoes, but they weren't very fresh. It honestly was just tomatoes and bread - you couldn't taste anything else.We got the margarita pizza. Our crust was way too crunchy. There was an overload of sauce. The mozzarella wasn't very great. Overall, it was just a pizza. To quote Naureen R's review, it tasted like consuming empty calories. To top it off, this place is so popular, they don't give a crap about good service. Our server didn't ask how we were doing, if we enjoyed our pizza, if we needed anything else, etc. Very much a ""get in, get out"" mind.If you're looking for good pizza in nyc - make the trek to Brooklyn / Cobble Hill area. I can recommend an AMAZING place - PM me for more details. I just don't think this place is worth the [less than 30 minute] wait.",4/16/2012Previous review,325,412,58,63RMC0LxibWFTlHOGgseGw

The water was pretty good though and the service to replenish the water bottle was excellent. Dare I say that the water was so good when the pizza showed up, we could hardly eat more than 1 slice each. They offer to wrap the remaining pizza up in foil so we can take it back to our hotel.

I had never experienced a pizza where the sauce stood out to me. It's all about the cheese and the crust, I thought. So, I voted we get the white pizza. Because... How could you go wrong with that much cheese? He made somewhat of a face that resembled utter dismay. ""But that sauce tho!""""Fine. Half and half?"" I suggested. He continued to insist it was still not enough sauced pizza. We finally settled on 2 small pizzas. Mine was half white and half margherita with pancetta and he ordered a full margherita. Immediately, I knew he was right. The moment the aside dripped off the crunchy crust, I understood. Incredibly simple but obviously made of fresh and quality ingredients. The cheese-less patches off the pizza were of no disappointment. The crust was crunchy, but not hard. Chewy and complimented it's ingredients entirely, in my opinion. The menu was short and simple, but what they do, the do damn well.The service was straight to the point. Don't expect fine dining experience. There is a line out the door (we waited about 30 mins), and they are trying to get people in and out. Which I can respect, because that's why the wait wasn't longer for us.

1639,Ritu D.,1,4,"I've been to Lombardi's on two different occasions - two different trips to NYC - and it is (so far) my FAVE NYC pizza!!! It was the first pizzeria! The actual restaurant is pretty adorable. You walk in to the main, original building and think ""mmm this smells delish... woah... this is tiny, we couldn't make reservations.... how are we EVER going to eat???"" But, through a few doors, there are more rooms with seats, then through some halls, there are more rooms with seats.. then up some stairs there are even more! On both occasions, we went on a Saturday night, but surprisingly didn't have to wait long the first time and didn't have to wait at all the second. If I reviewed this place after my first trip rather than slacking, I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service during my last trip is what is making me lower my rating to 4. This could have been attributed to the fact that we were through some halls, up some stairs and in, what seemed like, the last room in the place, or it could have just been the server. But service was slow, requests were fulfilled even slower. We wanted to change one of our Large pizzas to the smaller size pretty shortly after we ordered it, and the guy said he would try to catch it before it was made but if not, we wouldn't be able to, which was understandable, but then instead of going down, he stopped over at TWO tables, one at which he was just talking! (the kitchen was right downstairs, he could have totally stopped it before it was being made) - annnnd i highly doubt he even tried when he left our room. Which ended up actually being ok, bc my friends killed the pizza anyways!Speaking of the pizza.... YUMMMMMM!!! Thin, HOT, delicious, pizza goodness!!! My fave is just the plain original... steaming hot tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil....YUMMY. And, they won't wait until all your pizzas are ready to bring food out, which means your food literally just came out of the oven. SUPER fresh, and super delicious. But be careful, I've been way too eager both times and burned my mouth... worth it?? totally!!! This past time we went, the guys loaded on a bunch of toppings, which they still loved, but I wouldn't go TOO crazy, because it IS super thin crust! (oh and I had a caesar salad which was good, too.. lol)I know everyone either says Grimaldi's or Lombardi's when I ask what pizza to try in NYC. Next time, I hope to try Grimaldi's, but at the same time I am seriously obsessed with lombardi's now (my mouth is literally watering right now) that I don't know if I'll ever make it to the other place to compare the two!! I highhhhhly recommend this place (as does the rest of the world)PS - they do not take any reservations (and pics and other reviews make it seem like some days, you could encounter a line or a super long wait, so be prepared if you have a jam packed touristy day in NYCPS.. again... - they ONLY take cash - so be sure to have some on hand before heading over to Lombardi's.",11/8/2013,372,370,1496,cp-rWPVqlGyuroPKoBefYQ

But that's completely untrue.  I lived in New York for many years and ate out almost every single day.  There's a reason this place has 2000+ reviews and maintains a good rating.  Just because people know about it doesn't make it bad pizza.  I've been to Patsy's, multiple Ray's, 2 Bros, Di Fara's, Artichoke Basille, Grimaldi's, etc. etc.  New York has a million pizza spots and everyone has their own opinion on how they like it.Lombardi's was the original, uses coal, makes a beautiful thin crust charred pizza and uses quality toppings.  The best way to get it is to get the original Margherita pizza unadulterated.  That way you get thin slices, that just burst with flavor and aren't too soggy.  Only when you add tons of toppings, the slices get sloppy as a thin crust pizza folds underneath the weight.  Eat it original and don't complain.",5/7/2013,161,105,49,JTHuEA_QLMdGmYEHhAj8eA

Reason I give them a 4 star instead of five!The waiter was knowledgeable and helpful and quite pleasant, but was also starting to get a little annoying because every time I asked for something on my custom pizza such as; extra cheese and tomato sauce, he'd suggest what a bad idea that would be, which is fine, cause I get he wants us to have the best pizza experience possible. But! I still want my damn extra cheese and tomato cause regardless of how soupy he says it will get, I already know what the hell I like and want!  And you know what, I did take his advice just to be nice because I figure he may have a point, but guess what?... it was still soupy anyways. LOL! The cheese still slipped off the pizza with all the toppings which he also tried deterring us from adding to much like I was committing a blasphemy to all pizza's in the world! LOL! I noticed the table across from us wasn't feeling him also! So my suggestion, though they think their being helpful, don't tell people how they should order THEIR pizza!

I was looking forward to the stone cooked pizza since they were the best rated. We thought it was a small place but there were more spaces inside. All the walls were made from bricks. It had that old feel but with history.We got seated in a tight spot with a small table wondering how everything was going to fit? We received the big laminated menu and saw the prices! All I can say was wow to the prices but in the end the small pizza and soda cost us about $42 including tip! The small pizza could fit 3-4 people if you eat small. Small was definitely not a small. When we ordered the pizza, it cost $16 just with cheese but we wanted to try at least 5 toppings from Wild mushrooms, spinach, panceta, red onions and pepperoni.

1654,Allison C.,1,4,"The damn near sexual excitement over this place is well worth it.It's not a place to go for an everyday pizza pie. This is where you take out of town friends to impress them. ""YES, we are eating dinner at America's first pizzeria!"" This is where you go on dates because you want to ""do something fun yet familiar"". Their Original Pizza: San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh slabs of mozzarella, romano, and basil. Yeah, $20.50 is too much money for a simple pie. I DON'T CARE.

1655,Dru C.,1,4,Came here when I visited New York for NYE~!! Their pizzas are delicious. Large in the pan and amazingly delicious. The long waits and the size of the place seems very put off for me.I was happy that the wait wasn't long though. Me and my party of 4 only wait for like 15 minutes and we were served drinks at the bar while we waited. Their extensive list of drinks made me happy.The deliciously large pizza was the best. You can see the whole mozzarella ball was pattered onto each slice. The quantity is a perfect fit for 4 people.Coming back here when I visit New York again! It is a must :D,4/9/2013,349,409,142,t8cIgvaln7MbM51IS6MclA

The other with spinach garlic, pepperoni and mushroom. The total for both was about $60. It's a little more than your average pizza but the pieces were large (8 large pieces)  and it's definitely worth it!The ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza wasn't greasy.  It had a light healthy feeling if that can be said about pizza!Note: It's CASH ONLY!",10/20/2011,67,318,462,UtpY_2YsNXc-uj8e5M8a4Q

1666,Anna R.,1,4,This is a New York City institution so naturally you have to dine here. They're known for their thin crust pizza so do as the Romans do. You can have a simple Margherita pie or add toppings for $3 each. We had a Sweet Italian Sausage and Meatball pie. Great savory flavors and generous toppings. The pies come out fairly quickly and service is good. Two things to note: Cash only (though they have an ATM in the back); You will be waiting a very long time to dine here once you've gotten on the waiting list. Good pizza but the wait was ridiculously long.,10/10/2011,392,633,524,iCos25g_O3Z5Am9K4383WA

1669,Jean Y.,1,4,"I passed by this place a few times whenever I was in New York. There're always lines on both sides of the corners. My travel channel knowledge educated me about Lombardi's.Lombardi's was the first pizzeria in the United States, founded in 1905 in Little Italy, Manhattan.[1] The business started out as a grocery store at 53 Spring Street in 1897 opened by Gennaro Lombardi. In 1905 his employee Antonio Totonno Pero began selling tomato pies wrapped in paper and tied with a string. The original way of making a New York pizza in a coal oven is still used at the restaurant. Lombardi's is unusual in not selling slices, which are popular in New York but not traditional. Instead, only whole pies made to order are sold.In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island called Totonno's. In 1984 the original Lombardi's closed. In 1994, Lombardi's restaurant was re-opened a block away at 32 Spring Street by pizzamakers John Brescio, a childhood friend of Lombardi's grandson, and Gennaro Lombardi III, Gennaro Lombardi's grandson. In 2005, Lombardi's sold pizza pies for 5 cents, which was the original price in 1905, to celebrate the 100th anniversary.We didn't have to wait, cause some of us went ahead to get the seats. From the Times Square, we took the subway to Prince St. So called SoHo, where all the nice shops lined, and of course tourists also.Anyway Pizza was ok, not that great. I like Pepe's in New Haven more.Peroni beer was good.",3/24/2011,232,830,5660,rVxwIq-GU98GC2xMulsSqw
1670,Alice L.,1,3,"Hmm, very disappointed. The Pizza here has always been Phenomenal but our ast visit was less than OKay.We made the mistake of ordering anything ""non-pizza""The breadsticks were just that, plain breadsticks. No oil brushed on, no garlic, no seasoning, just bread. Dry Pizza dough, with a side of Marinara Sauce.Then we got the Caesar Salad, The salad was old and wilted. Enough said. We all know how appetizing dry curled up lettuce is. I don't even know if I should bother posting pictures, these dishes just don't seem to belong next to such great pizzas.Now the Pizza's... We ordered one with Garlic Spinach and Mushrooms. Although the Garlic Spinach was yummy, it was incredibly water-logged. Fine as a spinach dish alone, terrible on a pizza. Now we have a soggy pizza. Not very Lombardi's like. The Classic Margherita. Now this is more like it! Crispy!  Yet, something was off. It was good but not great. We came on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps they have a different Pizza Maker on sundays? Pretty disappointing, especially since we brought out of towners and talked this place up as the best Pizza in the City.",4/18/2013,318,815,342,ukJIYNNYujvZa5bO4ONvPQ

It wasn't too bad or anything, just nothing to remember.Nice ambiance though, pretty good service.

I feel like for $40, I could get a a lot more pizza elsewhere that would equally make me happy. I've checked it off my list.",4/14/2015,114,1646,26,viwKpVVaOhWur77Sh4L4cw
1675,Ruby K.,1,3,"we ordered the half red half white pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and onions. it tasted okay, i thought the pizza was a bit soggy towards the center of the pie (so the tips of the pizza slice). i was NOT a fan of the white pizza - i didn't like how thick the cheese was, and i like tomato sauce, so had to order tomato sauce on the side. the customer service was impeccable. the waitress, although not particularly friendly, knew exactly what she was talking about in terms of the menu and the restaurant's history. the other members of the staff were great at navigating me from one bathroom to the next when the first was taken (there were several throughout the restaurant). all in all, this pizza was quite expensive, and wasn't the best pizza i ever had. if you're into pizza and haven't been to Lombardi's yet, you should at least try this place for the experience, but don't expect the best pizza from here.",5/2/2016,337,329,138,0O7O53dkw1i7hQVdFdtn2A

The other reviews say that this place is overrated and it probably is but the food was still really good.

1680,Kimberly C.,0,2,"After living in NY for two years, I thought it was time to change the fact that I had never had a real slice of NY style pizza. Everyone said that Lombardi's was the only place to go, so that's where I went. My friend and I split a small Margherita since it's the classic standard. tbh, it was pizza. I can recognize that it was great pizza, but now that it's checked off the NY bucket list I'm not going back. It's cash only with no free refills. It's a pretentious place that doesn't advertise itself on the street since it knows it'll have a constant stream of tourists that I have bought into the hype. The waitress forgot about us after taking our order, never offered to refill our water, and waited for us to leave rather than accepting she was going to have to give us change instead of accepting an almost 50% tip. And lastly, the wait time for the pizza to cook was ridiculous. We ordered our small about 5 min before the table next to us ordered the large, and they got their pizza about 10 min before we did. Just because you're making less money off of us shouldn't mean we're less important customers.

1681,Gabriel M.,0,3,"This was my final stop on my NY pizza taste test and in this case, last was certainly least.  While it was good pizza, I give it 3.5 stars, it couldn't compare to John's and Prince St Pizza.  Pulling a slice typically pulled the toppings from surrounding slices.  Got a half Margherita, half pepperoni, that I certainly enjoyed, but given the chance again, I'd go elsewhere to get my pizza fix.  The cash only option is old and tired, I understand food trucks or the food stand doing it, but a brick and mortar joint should allow for some additional payment flexibility.",4/30/2016,46,149,34,Mf3crZOYe0xyObPrLmtL0A

And it was so so good. The pizza dough was thin but still sturdy enough to hold the pizza together. There was also a generous amount of ricotta on the pizza which was deliciously creamy.Our server was really pleasant and checked on is frequently.

This place has some serious pizza history and is among the few that have the privilege of running coal fired ovens. Grimaldi's and Juliana's are the only other two that come to mind.Lombardi's is a great value for large groups. All of their toppings are fresh and the pizza comes out quickly.

I was quite disappointed. The bottom of the overly thick crust was burned black. The center was doughy and soft, undercooked. The tomato sauce was too ample and runny. The mozzarella cheese was sporadically placed on the pizza. The quality was not at all good. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The dough was not of superb quality. That is an essential part of any pizza and Lombardi misses the mark. Plus they don't accept credit cards so only cash. Inconvenient way to help them avoid a 3% credit card service fee.

I'm no connoisseur, but they were the best calzones I've ever had! I went back last week and decided to try the pizza, and I'm surprised to say that I was disappointed. Although the pizza was good, I didn't think that my two topping pepperoni and mushroom was worth $26. Like I said, the ingredients were fresh and of high quality, it just wasn't anything to write home about. In addition, our server wasn't very attentive and the host seated us upstairs with views of brick walls of adjacent buildings, and we felt pretty removed from the rest of the restaurant.

1735,Massimo C.,0,1,"It's my first time posting a review on yelp. I would like to start by saying that I'm Italian and, even the average review of Lombardi's are quite high, my expectations were not. As I walked with my friends we were welcomed by an unidentifiable weird smell that I wouldn't know how to describe, could be cheese? Stale feet? We followed a waitress and while walking between a set of tables I could see the happy faces of the customer that were delightly eating what, to my impression, was an average looking pizza, not Naple's style, with not enough cheese on it but too much tomatoe sauce. We sat and ordered a pitcher of coke. The menu is simple. You can choose the kind of pizza, the dimension and the toppings. First thought: kind of overpriced for pizza. Ok its 18inches, big... But 23$ + toppings that start at 3$ for the veggie ones to 5$ for the ""premium"" ( thats on the menu). So we decided on a margherita, 18inches + fresh wild mushrooms(3$) and italian sausage(4$). The waitress brought us the coke first. We started drinking it, but it had a really weird after taste, my friend described it as copper, still a mystery to me how he knows how copper tastes like.On the thought of being possibly poisoned we called the waitress and reported that. She didn't have a surprised reaction ( I guessed it wasn't the first time) so she collected the coke we had in our glasses and in the pitcher and went to change it with the coke from the other machine. Seriously???? Was that normal?? What did we just drink?I started having doubts about the place, not that I didn't have already. She brought a new pitcher, this time around tasted better, still far from real coke. Whatever... Closed an eye.So I asked her what kind of fresh wild mushroom were they. She told me many kinds, but she would go ask in the kitchen. Obviously she never came back with an answer. The pizza arrived. After the first tasteless bite accompanied an after taste of... what? chicken!! Yes the sweet italian sausage we ordered tasted exactly like chicken, so it reminded me the scene in the movie matrix where on of the character was saying that many things tasted like chicken, what things??? Wah! What am I eating??? I could barely taste the mushrooms at all, and they didnt really look good. Probably they are those kinds u can buy in bulk at the supermarket at very cheap price. Fresh wild mushrooms in winter? They have to tell me where they went pick them up, really! ""Wild"" my ass, that was my bad, I should have suspected it. They didnt let the dough raise as it didnt look elastic at all, like a naple's pizza should be. First thing I said: it's an amateur dough! It's just really really bad. Tomatoe sauce poor as well and used in huge quantity that made everything slide. We did drop some of those expensive toppings on our clothes. My friend made fun of me when a piece of that sweet italian sausage (chicken) fell on my grey sweater, but he wasn't really smiling when standing up he noticed that the same happened all over his pants. To sum it up it was one of the worst italian restaurants I have been in New York, yeah there is worse, but definitely the worst pizza, even compared to the 1$ places you see around, much worse. So bad that I forced myself to write a review. Do me a favor and dont go please! There are so many better places.Day after update:They just told me at the pharmacy that my symptoms might be food poisoning. Not even kidding.",1/28/2015,56,2,0,RlykGWwl0JGnLZJIREKt-g

1742,Mario P.,0,4,"The original NY pizza. It was a good experience, the pizza was pretty good and the dough was nice and crispy. I tried half original margherita and white pizza, I didn't not add any additional topping on it, as I wanted to try it the original way. I personally liked the white pizza better, it was a little different than your typical pizza, the margherita on the other hand I think needed some toppings on it, by itself for me was a little bland, because all it has is the sauce and cheese, so all I could taste was dough and the sauce, so next time I will definitely try it with toppings. Now just because this is the most famous pizza I think I will try other pizza spots next time I'm in NY, this one was a little pricey for me considering what it was, the pizzas do not come with any toppings and if you want any on there they are $3 or $4 each, on top of the $23ish for a large pizza.

The cash-only aspect is nothing other than obnoxious, but the flavorful toppings and ingredients make that something I can mostly overlook.

Meaning I've been eating here since it reopened. Quality fell off extremely bad in the past year. I first noticed this when they told us that they reduced the amount of cheese on the pizza ""because the customers"" complained that there was too much cheese. Then the tangy sauce started going down hill and now its just plain sauce, then it was less basil and now they even cut the pepperoni thinner whereas it used to be thick. The  dough also was not given time to rise and it tasted like crunchy flatbread as opposed to being chewy doughy goodness. Service is horrendous as always but it used to be tolerated because of the excellent pizza, the chair are uncomfortable unless you are 9 years old and 4 feet tall. The salad is miniscule and the soda is ALWAYS FLAT and they never allow you to order soda from the bottle. This is pathetic in that ...in the more than a decade I've eaten there, the in house soda has always been flat.

Upon my first bite, I immediately knew that this was a great tomato sauce. Traditional. The tomatoes are the prime flavor to this sauce, and not even the mozzarella takes away from it. Slightly sweet, tomato, moderately thick yet still light, and best of all -- hot. The pizza dough is well made; it's thin but not very thin such that you get a nice crisp on the external layer while soft inward. There's a slight chew to the dough to make sure that you're not just eating air. Also from the dough, you can taste the earthiness from the oven in which they bake the pizza in. Mozzarella is light, but adds a hearty richness to the pizza. Fresh basil adds in herbal accents and the meatballs, if you get it, adds so much savoriness without compromising the tomato flavors.This is a good ol', plain, simple, delicious pizza.SERVICE:Service was kind, polite, and attentive. There's nothing extraordinary that goes on, but they kept up with a good small chat.ENVIRONMENT:There's enough seating to fit a good amount of people, but not enough to keep up the hype. Tables are separated enough to give a modest amount of privacy. Interior decor is mostly wood and makes a more vintage ambiance. Overall, I would come back here if I could because this is something I would go for when feeling for something simple but good. This is in no way a pizza establishment with blazing, strong flavors but one that aims to deliver a pizza made from a good foundation.",5/8/2013,533,719,10,mydWDBBNHdXcq6WO8tfv_Q
1752,Lordlupine G.,0,4,One of the most delicious pizza I ate in NYC. Only after Julian's in Brooklyn beats this. We had a Margherita pizza with spinach and garlic topping. Pie came out really delicious with tasting cheese. Tomatoe sauce tasted well. It came out really fresh. If you are  around little Italy for lunch or dinner its a must visit restaurant.Note: it's a CASH only place. Or get ready to pay atm fees.,1/17/2016,2,54,32,nsjF1sfBu6elvM1DmRxXkg
1753,Chris J.,0,3,"I consider myself somewhat of a pizza afficianado. Lombardi's has a unique history and is only one of two pizzeria places that I know if that still use coal-fired ovens ( the other being Pepe's in New Haven, CT). Today the wood-fired ovens are more prominent. Ordered the Margherita pie with no additional toppings. I'm an old-school, traditionalist. Pie came out fast and was hot when it reached the table. Crust was slightly charred, as it should be. A bit of chew is also something I look for in a traditional Napolitan pizza due to the high gluten flour. This pie did not disappoint in that respect. Sauce was good. The pie was a bit skimpy on the cheese and could have used a bit more chopped basil. Overall good, but nothing spectacular considering the price. The wine on the menu was disappointing; $8 for an extremely small glass and was not much better than an Italian jug wine. Carlo Rossi Paisano or Gallo Chianti is better than what they serve here. .",10/6/2017,0,4,0,ihoDKE55wKB2dqFiLAWbaQ
1754,Tien K.,0,2,"This place is overrated. First time here because the reviews were good and there's over four thousand reviews. So yes, my expectations were high. The meatballs were good. The sauce was awesome. The pizza was mediocre. They were very stingy with their toppings. Pizza cane out cold. I like Pizza Hut better. Not a family friendly restaurant. No high chairs or changing tables in the bathroom.",4/14/2016,160,16,7,vQ-XuV1h_aElg-qsfCVrkg
1755,Andy F.,0,4,"Seating and service were prompt despite a clearly busy restaurant. We had the Margherita pizza with no toppings. The wait for the pizza was long, but well worth the wait because it was hot out of the oven! So hot, that I burned the roof of my mouth! Toppings were an additional $4, additional $5 for premium meats. The waiter gave us a pitcher of water (that's the only drink we really wanted). I could tell that they were going out of their way to get people seated quickly because they were setting up additional tables and chairs in the dining area. Our bill came to $23 before tip, not a bad price to pay for delicious home made pizza from Little Italy!",1/15/2017,75,6,6,FUQBeyKBnf3WxUmUIADBVw
1756,Jeanne P.,0,3,"Underwhelming considering the hype. Service was ok, but it was packed so a little wait and scattered attention is understandable.

1759,Sandy L.,0,5,"My absolute FAVORITE pizza.  I definitely have this on my recommendation list any time they come to visit NYC.  Not only are their toppings, flavors, cheeses, sauces and crust all well prepared and full of flavor, you can TASTE THE FRESHNESS.  Original Pizza - Standard pizza is made with fresh mozzarella, a son marzano tomato sauce and topped with romano and fresh basilSmall 14"" (six Slices) $16.50Large 18"" (six Slices)  $20.50Each additional topping on a full pizza is $3 and $2 for half of the pizza.We ordered the small  which was the perfect size for two people.  We included mushrooms, homemade meatballs and their sweet Italian sausage.  HOLY CAMOLY IT IS AMAZING.I am drooling just thinking about this pizza.  Every bite is a burst of oozing cheese and flavors.  The crust is thin.  I definitely recommend ordering the homemade meatballs with whatever additional toppings you want.  Each bite of the meatball is perfect savory/sweetness, a perfect soft texture and the meaty goodness that you want on a pizza.  I would even consider order just a side of their house made meatballs because they taste amazing stand-alone.  I can't wait to return!",12/16/2012,246,438,785,nbIR2COIJrcUM9yVagBCCQ
1760,Adam M.,0,5,"Old NY, A bigger than an WV power pant, coal oven,  Perfectly charred, bubbling, thin crust pizza.What else do you need?Try the clam pie.  Few make it, fewer make it well.

1761,Tunaidi A.,1,4,"It's fortunate that I had Lombardi's first before I had Grimaldi's. However, it is unfortunate that I had reviewed Grimaldi's before reviewing Lombardi's. Lombardi's was almost at the top of the totem pole until I came across Grimaldi's, which is now my favorite of all time.Lombardi's is great, probably one of the best New York-style pizzerias I've had. Their white cheese pizza is delicious and the rest are all just as good. The good thing about Lombardi's is that the waits are relatively short as compared with Grimaldi's. I highly recommend Lombardi's. It's probably my second favorite pizza place in New York.",11/19/2012,522,1480,10,8c3XuWaEQwzbV9AtiXB8mw
1762,Russell S.,0,1,"After the unbelievable drive circling the block to find a parking spot in the area and the walk through the massage parlor section of NYC to get to this famous destination. As a pizza fan and being my 1st time in NYC, going to where pizza began in the U.S. was a must. I found the atmosphere to be cramped but very clean. We were paraded by the 1905 oven which was nice to see before being seated in the back in the tourist section. We ordered the two meatballs and the cheese pizza with a one topping (sweet peppers) large pizza and 2 glass's of soda. The meatballs had a lot of flavor or the sauce on top did i'm not sure which one it was. The pizza came out quick but there wasn't too much to it so I could see how it was prepared an cooked in 20 mins. With razor thin slices of cheese (Just enough to color it white)  and sweet peppers dotting in between. The sauce was bitter which masked any sweetness in the sweet peppers the edges were cooked well and the center was mushy and thin. The bill weighed more than the pizza did. Which came out to $65.00 with tax. I'm not sure where all of these 5 star ratings are from people tend to eat pizza at more than one place in NY and might have gotten this place mixed up with someone else. This was WAY over priced and not the type of pizza id buy twice, The toll plaza pizza on the way down was lousy but still better and at a fraction of the price. It's a good thing they don't have a money back guarantee they would be out of business. It was however an experience. I can say I ate where it all began in the U.S.A. If this is how it all began i'm surprised pizza ever really took off in America.",5/31/2017,0,5,0,dEo9N2exZB3t8xbC5Aneng
1763,P O.,0,2,"We get to NYC every few years and make it a point to visit Lombardi's. We overlook the wait, paper plates, plastic cups, the obscenely high prices and cash only policy... for what was a damn good pizza. Well, sadly, that is no longer the case. While our wait was unusually short, the pizza was surprising bad. The crust was soggy in the middle, the sauce was watery and bland. For us it is official, the emperor has no clothes and Lombardi's has become just another tourist trap living off a reputation it no longer deserves. We won't be back and strongly suggest you avoid the place.",10/17/2017,0,7,0,0D35XOiypi2D_ghYokm8ww
1764,Cherry L.,0,3,"Came here because of the hype while visiting NYC. Supposedly it's the first pizzeria or something, but who knows. The pizza was definitely overpriced for what it tasted like because there was nothing special about it. We ordered a small which is plenty for two people. It's 6 slices and each slice is HUGE. The plain margherita pizza (cheese & basil in tomato sauce) is like $19 and I think we added mushrooms and pepperoni to our pizza with each topping being an additional $3. So our pizza came out to probably like $25 which is so not worth it. It was mediocre and just didn't wow me. The house salad was good, though!",8/11/2015,162,94,106,3AYKEJhAxEu2TWCdNHBsrg

My friend and I shared a caesar salad and a large pizza and we each had a few beers. We finished the ENTIRE pizza between two small girls. We were pretty embarrassed that we were able to scarf that whole thing down, but it was so good!We ended up eating here twice during our six day trip and decided to squeeze it in before our flight back to LA.

Guy took our order rude and un happy.   When we asked for the bill, I gave $50 for a $40 bill and the waiter asked me if I wanted any change.  I thought I ask him 'seriously? Did you actually ask me what I think you did?'.  He didnt crack a single smile all night long and made me feel uncomfortsble and I felt like he did not enjoy waitressing at all.  Well, he needs to find a job he is happy with, his manager should take notice. After that, I only left 5 bucks (for the guy ghat brought us the water really) as I did not think he worth more given his tough attitude, when I said good night he completrly ignored me and my wife too.Wow! When we left the restaurant we were not greeted by a single person on our way out(coincidence?).Food: after reading all these reviews about the best pizza in NYC I expected to eat something similar to a pizza I had in Napoli or at least Franco Manca in London, or Santa Maria in Ealing(10/10 all the way every time).  I would not dare compare those pizzas to the one we had here, they are not on the same league at all. 5.8/10 best case scenario. Cant believe all these positive reviews on the taste. Forget about service, taste was just average. Would I go there again? Absolutely not.

1769,Abby S.,0,3,This place only takes cash. The Pizza is okay but I felt it's overpriced. We had a small one topping pizza for $27. The pepperoni was so tiny I've never seen one so small. The monzerlla did not even go all over the pizza so some spots didn't have cheese. I like the taste of it I just wished we get what we paid for. I think it's over hyped and overpriced.

We ordered bruschetta, a margherita pizza  with pepperoni and sausage and the white pizza. I had a slice of each. The pizzas were good, but not that great. Sure it tasted fresh as I could tell they use quality ingredients, but it was definitely not the best pizza I've ever had. Sadly, I've had better NY style pizza in Los Angeles. I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. Also, I know it's NYC, but $30 something for a large pizza is outrageous!",8/10/2015,64,119,635,EvUwUOENmwDWpcU1rBqgFQ

The atmosphere is fun. The prices are consistent with other brick oven pizza places. But i'm really puzzled. Is this really the famous pizza or have things changed?

We indulged in a pizza with sweet Italian sausage and onions, made with their gooey fresh mozzarella and San Marzano tomato sauce. It was heavenly.  Their salads were also really tasty; try the caesar salad and its fresh peppery taste.

We got half mushroom (for me) and half pepperoni (for him) small pizza.I can't believe two person tables were getting a large and then wasting it, it says there right on the menu how many slices you get. A small is the perfect size for two hungry people, 3 slices each. Also the rootbeer is good, I've never had the brand before and I can't recall the name now.'Oh as for seating: if they try to stick you in the basement, tell them you'll wait to sit somewhere else.

1796,Abdul E.,0,3,"If rating was based just on historic significance, l probably would give higher score. This is a restaurant so based on quality it is average for a brick oven pizza. If you have never had a break oven pizza it may overwhelm you but as coated to other brick oven pizza it is good not outstanding. Serving in plastic cups and paper plate is unacceptable in this setting. Also cash only is unacceptable in this setting.  Limited pizza options and everything is on a build your own so toppings add up quickly. For the price, quality not justified. My suggestion is visit it for history and just get margarita pizza as if you pile up toppings it is not worth what you pay for it! I am glad I came for the historic significance but would probably not return if I am craving brick oven pizza.",6/1/2016,0,145,546,l7xAzsATROHjuntoIPHqkQ

But I've had Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn bridge and it was crap compared to this. We had a small pie with pepperoni and meatballs. Both were perfect. The sauce was amazing. The crust and cheese couldn't have been better. It single-handedly redeemed New York style pizza for me, which I thought was nothing special until now. And yes it was more expensive and cash only. Don't care. Worth it. Plus it was Friday night at 8 PM and we only waited ten minutes for a table. Good service, they seemed busy but were attentive. Walking through the kitchen was fun too!

1799,Jackie M.,0,3,"I came in on a weekday at 3pm for a snack. We ordered the famous charcoal brick white pizza. For a female who orders veggie pizza and loves cheese, I enjoyed the white pizza. It was loaded with cheese and not heavily dumped with sauce. There's definitely the charcoal taste to the crust and I enjoy it. Coming from Chicago with the usual pizza dumped with sausage and tomatoe sauce, this may not be the pizza for you. My brother and husband did not enjoy the white pizza. They literally dunk the pizza into the meatball sauce to get more flavor.",3/4/2015,235,346,1118,9Xc7vla9JStodqfaYdJTow

1801,Jeffrey W.,0,2,"Went there on a Tuesday around 7:00 pm with my fiancee. Around that time, they opened the basement since there were more room for all the people waiting. We were the first to order out of every parties. My order wasn't complicated. One small classic pizza margherita. I looked around. Everyone else took their sweet time and ordered their pizza. Guess what? We were the last couple to receive the pizza. Seriously, others around us ordered the same thing and others ordered different types of pizza. But no, we were the last one. People literally finished their pizza by the time we got ours. How it was handled was very disappointing.I'm a big fan of pizza. Since this is the ""first pizzeria"", we figured we would give it a shot. After all, I thought the pizza was okay. Their crust is good but I rather go out and eat a regular New York slice. Cash only.

Plus taxes and tips so basically it's like 40$ a pizza. WTF????And it's 23$ if you go for the large one!Their wine is awful, just go for the fountain soda.

1805,Mike S.,0,3,Was looking forward to eating here for a long time since I saw a piece on them from a tv show. Here are the details: arrived there for lunch and was greeted immediately and sat at a table. Ordered the Margherita small pizza with pancetta and mushrooms. Also ordered 2 fountain sodas. What I liked: service was good. No waiting for a table and waiter was okay. What could've been better: The pizza was way overpriced. The bill for the small pizza and 2 fountain drinks came to about $37. The pizza was also a little soggy/chewy underneath which in my opinion shouldn't have been so for a thin crust brick oven pizza. The mushrooms also tasted frozen and not fresh as described in their menu. They also don't accept credit cards which is a little ridiculous since their menu is way overpriced. Was it the best pizza I've ever had? -no way. I've had much better pizza in much less famous pizzerias. I won't be returning.,9/24/2015,0,22,5,nrRahlNPOpRE8hUlfeP2oQ

It was the lovely duty, because it's the oldest pizzeria in NYC. I ordered a small original margherita pizza ($22). The price is higher, of course it's place with history and also in the centre. The interior is definitely old school Italian, with some red checked tablecloths and family photos on the wall. Nice and cozy.The pizza was indescribably good and what I liked a lot was the fresh basil! I think that's the way all pizza should be taste.

But then they didn't have anymore seats so they allowed us to sit in the front.

Coming from LA, there is nothing that can compare to this, which made it that much more better I feel. We had the pepperoni pizza and the mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were delicious with their fresh ingredients and pizza sauce. The pizza was perfectly thin and had a crisp bite throughout. There was not a single soggy uncooked area. We also ordered the sangria which goes great with the meal and is highly recommended. Definitely a try for NY pizza. From all my friends that live here and have had the other places like Grimaldi's, Lombardi's beats that hands down on taste and wait.

Now, back in San Francisco and thinking about Lombardi's pizza.It's perfect all around, the toppings are fresh, the sauce is tasty, the cheese is good (not too much and not too little) and the crust is thin, crunchy and super tasty as well.Even cold leftovers taste good, especially when you're drunk :-)",1/9/2013,29,243,76,2uM3O9Qy4vxvITAfke7_4g

1853,Jen G.,0,3,"My basic knowledge of Lombardi's is that they (supposedly) make some of the most stellar pies in NYC.  Also, my grandparents' had their first date there.  So it was more ""why not?"" than ""why bother?"" when stumbling back home from Rockwood on a late Sunday night, that we decided to pop into this certifiably old school pizza spot - complete with checkerboard tablecloths, a coal fired oven and friendly waitresses.We started with the two ""huge"" meatballs as an app. They turned out to be super moist, but not super flavorful - though the portion was generous for the price.  ANDDD the Pizza!  It was - okay?  We ordered the margherita pie, and the basil was fresh - very fresh - but the rest of the slice was disappointingly uneventful.  The sauce was pretty basic and the cheese was kind of... chewy.  It wasn't bad - satisfied my tipsy appetite - but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The slice I had from Lee's earlier in the day may have skewed my palate, but I'm not dying to return here.",7/28/2014,232,222,10,8IA3ZYlrW9xT4T1cm5fjvQ
1854,Allison R.,0,4,"Spent last weekend in New York and always find we need to stop at Lombardi's at least once. Lines can be a bit out of control, but we came by around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and had a short wait of 10-15minutes.We happily took a seat at the bar and enjoyed a beer while we waited. Service is always quick and friendly and the food is delicious. I'll agree with other Yelpers the prices are a little expensive but as the lines show, they're not hurting for business. Menu is simple with the focus on pizza. Choose from a white or red pie and the option to add toppings (for $4 each!). We've always gotten the red pie and added pepperoni. It's Italian style so is small, crispy, and packed with flavor. We opted for a half white pie this round based on the Yelp reviews and weren't a big fan. Instead of red sauce it's just a mix of cheeses and ricotta. Was very rich and creamy and a little underwhelming. Started to taste one-note after a few bites, and we missed the acidity and simplicity of the tomato sauce.Caesar salad was really good and enough for a healthy helping for two. Priced at $11. They make their own sauce and was thick and garlicky. I appreciated it wasn't even remotely close to the thin white store-bought Caesar dressings at other places.Delicious pizza, and never a bad meal if you can stomach the price!",5/24/2015,32,94,510,pXG9zF5ntNQ_IZ13vzYmhg

We got a classic margharita pizza with roasted peppers, and it was amazing. The tomato sauce alone is worth a visit...really tastes like tomatoes!

Overall, this inside is a lot bigger than you think. We went for a late lunch (3pm), and had a 5 minute wait to be seated in the back space past the kitchen.Here's where our -1 star comes in: they brought us the wrong pizza...3 timesBut then, there's a return of a star(!!): despite the incorrect order, each time they brought out the pizza at lightning speed; they comped us breadsticks; and removed like $20 dollars off our bill. Our waitress was so apologetic about the situation.Now, I can understand why Lombardi's has made it for so long.

We came here on a Sunday for lunch. The place is quite spacious, with also a basement level. We ordered two large pizzas, one with sausage and spinach, and the other with bacon and mushrooms. The size of the pizza was bigger than what I'm used to, but the crust was very thin, which I thoroughly loved! Every slice was loaded with cheese and sauce, and they were quite generous with the toppings too.

1878,Peter I.,0,5,"I have to say that I get a little angry when this pizza is left of the top 10 lists for best pizza in New York. I think people get down on Lombardi's for not being the hidden gem that it once was but I personally think they do an amazing job of handling the crowds and have never, in any way, compromised the quality of their pizza.We went on a busy Friday night and were expecting to wait a while for a table. Not the case. The waitstaff runs a very tight ship and they've done a great job of maximizing the space in the building.Now for the pizza itself. You come here for the oven. Just ask the Culinary Institute of America that regularly takes samples of the wall of this oven to try to figure out why it makes the pizza taste so good.No matter what you order, make sure you get at least one original margherita pizza. This is the pizza where you have the best chance of tasting what makes this place special. It's a crispy flavorful crust, ultra fresh red sauce and perfectly sliced circles of mozzarella. That's it. So f@@(&#^$ good!!Not that it needs it but the service is fast and attentive and somehow you never seem to be waiting long for your food (the oven is gigantic).

I'm an oldtime NYer but I still love to go to Lombardi once in a while for their delicious pizza. Pizza is made extremely well.  The dough lives up to expectation where you have a thin crust but sturdy enough to carry all the moisture from the tomato sauce. Not a big fan of their popular clam pizza.  It's great if you like clam, but a bit on the dry-side for a pizza since it doesn't come with white sauce or red sauce.",6/8/2014,50,291,89,Cq6dJj2u8qr74XalDgP93A

We ordered the large margherita pizza with mushroom and onion as toppings. Omg when the pizza came out, it was heaven. It tasted so good. I think the price is a bit too much for a large pie. The second time, we went on a weekday and the wait was 10-15 min. We ordered bruschetta for the appetizer and large margherita pizza. The bruschetta was okay. Nothing special. Just tomatoes on Italian bread. For the price it was not worth it. When our pizza came out, it was not really warm. It didn't taste so fresh and good as the first time around.

1888,Nina L.,1,4,"Very similar to the (also) famed Grimaldi's. Simple pies, but you won't ever have a bad meal. I find that there isn't much to say in the instance of Lombardi's. They don't offer a tremendous variety of options when it comes to toppings (you won't find any prosciutto or pineapples or anything else you can think of at a place like this). It's very basic/old school; go with a pepperoni or sausage. Overall, it's hard to give them a bad rating because they do serve a good pie but it's only really something worth trying once with a big group. There is certainly more innovative pizza in New York City - with a shorter wait and less painful service, too.",9/26/2012,567,732,208,hg6tlp69rzq3aWl0RjwHBQ

You can taste the difference in the tomato sauce for sure; just how fresh the ingredients are. I'm from California, so pizza to me is typically pizza hut, papa johns, etc. and this is by far means 100x better. Great service and just an all around good pizza.

There were so many pizzerias I wanted to try in New York but I knew I had to try ""America's First Pizzeria"" and it did not disappoint! I was worried about the wait, but the restaurant was actually pretty big so we were seated immediately. Margherita Pizza ($19.99): The two of us shared the 14"" small pizza (3 big slices each) and it was the perfect amount for two hungry people. I enjoyed the thin crust, which was very crispy but not too burnt. I really liked the fact that it wasn't too greasy like a lot of thin crust pizzas I've had where the bottom would get soggy from the oil. The crust stayed perfectly crispy throughout the entire meal. The mozzarella cheese and basil were also very fresh and tasty. My favorite part of the pizza though has to be the delicious tomato sauce. Usually I don't really pay close attention to the sauce on pizzas, but this was so good!! I loved the fresh tomato taste with just the perfect amount of sweetness. OVERALL:Pizza was delicious.

Lombardi's claims to be New York's first pizza joint- I'm not a historian so I'll buy that. Pizza was simple Italian fare but pretty darn tasty. I would highly recommend the meatballs- insider tip: gravy must be the Italian word for ""red sauce"" (step aside marinara) because these little beauties are smothered in red saucy goodness- not Thanksgiving gravy- as the menu may lead you to believe.  The house chianti was also a good choice and happily guzzled by the weary travelers (and myself). I would eat at this pizza place whenever I needed to devour a whole pizza if it were closer to me.  I suppose for now maybe when I get the craving for a great pie with fresh sauce and basil full of flavor, and mozzarella to drip all over my face and get stuck to my hands, I will jaunt down here with my camera around my neck and my black socks pulled high up my calves and really enjoy myself.",8/27/2014,32,74,11,aDnH5a-o7luuHHwzB-Wy_A

We ordered the margarita, and it was just as good as any other margarita pie I've had. The bonuses: it was massive, and I liked all the extra sauce.",3/4/2016,83,193,23,LNFpJ-pKpiGE7UGs-S8DMg
1902,Ryan W.,0,4,"CASH ONLYGreat pizza and the service is much better than Grimaldi's. Took the B train to get here, it's not that far of a walk.The pies are more saucy than I expected. This wasn't a bad thing, since it's delicious. A little sweet, with a little bit of a bite to it. A string of mozzarella twisted around my fork well over ten times. The crust. Well, you come here for the crust. Slightly sour and kissed by the coal-fired oven. There were a good four or five black bubbles welling up from the edges of the pie.The restaurant is laid out a little bit like a question mark. You enter into a square front dining room and bar, and you're taken back into a narrow dining room that leads to the oven, chaos, with pizzas being put in an pulled out, plated, and the serving staff running around greasing the wheels of the restaurant. This leads into another long and narrow dining room. Lombardi's, like John's of Bleecker, sometimes runs a line just to be ostentatious, so don't let it deter you from grabbing a buzzer and waiting for a table. The pizza is unparalleled. You won't be disappointed.",4/3/2015,8,104,2,s0pKY3o5k56t-0pVf1trZQ

1904,Erica K.,0,5,"Okay, honestly, I would consider moving to NYC just for the pizza.And by pizza, I mean for Lombardi's. We came in (a party of 12) during a busy dinner rush with no reservations. We were told we would be seated in 20 minutes, which I found completely reasonable! However, within a few minutes, a few of my family members decided we didn't have time to sit down and eat, so we ordered our pizzas to go, instead. First of all, the service was incredible. Even throughout the hustle and bustle that ensued during the late evening in the restaurant, all the wait staff managed to not only keep their cool, but to be incredibly kind as well. They were actually the sweetest wait staff I had encountered during my entire trip to NYC. Love! We accidentally ordered the white pizzas instead of the regular pizzas, and asked a waiter last minute if we could change our order. The waiter, along with the chef, was extremely accommodating and fulfilled our request. They even gave back the few dollars in change that they owed. I was so surprised! Next, as we (including myself and my young cousins) were waiting for our pizzas, my youngest cousin kept drifting towards the bar of the restaurant. As I continuously called her back to the seating area, she insisted to watch the bartender work his magic. He began creating a beautiful soda type of drink, with cream soda, topped with whipped cream and cherries. He called my young cousins over and presented them with his little gift. Does it get sweeter than that? I insisted to pay for the drink, but he wouldn't let me!Our pizzas were done within 15 minutes, YAY! The pizzas were thin crusted (aka the best), with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. One bite of this pizza won me over. I could taste the freshness in each and every bite. The cheese was absolutely impeccable. It's a shame that all pizza can't taste like this! Summary? This is a place with a personality. It's a must, in my opinion, to check out this place if you're in the city. On top of the actual food being outstanding, the service is even more incredible, which is what stuck out in my mind. It's for these reasons that you gotta give this place a try. Thanks for the sweet memory, Lombardi's! :)",5/17/2014,58,72,11,DtPW4KOuNxq0sdb6Tvy-ag
1905,Jon C.,0,2,"Half of NY is going to be furious for my posting this, but I have to be honest, I'm a pizza addict.  I've eaten pizza all over the world. I'm in NY regularly. I've tried pizza at tons of places all over town and mostly because I virtually grew up in NY.  However, this is pretty much just a tourist trap.  Yes, it's the first pizzeria in the US, but that's not tantamount to being the best pizzeria in the US, or even in NY.  Honest truth?  It was alright.  I don't crave it.  I won't be going back.  We had a basic pepperoni, it was a little on the bland side, rather expensive and nothing I ""must"" have again.  I'm certainly not talking ""terrible"" here, but more of a ""meh...who cares?"" kind of experience.  A trip up to The Bronx for Full Moon's pizza, or down to Grimaldi's on Old Fulton in Brooklyn (or even their Manhattan location) will probably do more for your tastebuds.In terms of service, it was fine.  No more, no less.  No one went out of their way to be accommodating or dutiful.  They just sort of did what they had to do and that was that....whatever. No complaints on that, but no praise either.The place is a little cramped, too, and there tends to be a wait.I was there with two other people and we all shared the same opinion.I say ""go"" if you'd like to tell people ""I've been to THE Lombardi's"" but I can't say you're missing anything if you skip it.....no offense, to Lombardi's!",10/25/2016,0,15,0,-MhyoFhMa8a_rYaKooYP3g

As soon as we walk in, there are people waiting for a table and we let the host know that we needed a table for three. The first thing he tells us is 'We don't have high-chairs here and your baby will have to eat in the stroller, is that ok?' Between the attitude and not being family friendly I almost walked out but really wanted pizza so we stayed. We were seated within 5 minutes on the second floor. We ordered the meatballs and Margherita  pizza. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars in for those meatballs. They were the best meatball we've ever had! My son and husband ate every last morsel. The pizza was meh...nothing special AT ALL. I don't get what the big deal is.",10/22/2014,20,14,3,W_juuNFDGtD6eUgrIWUIjA

Your best bet would be to go there in the afternoon on weekday if you want to avoid the painful wait. Otherwise, the wait is well worth it. There's a bar inside where you can order a drink while you wait, so that certainly helps quite a bit. This place is an absolute must if in NYC.

The host was very friendly. We were greeted quickly, and the service was good, although our pizza did take awhile to come out. Close to 30 minutes. So make sure you're not starving when you walk in. Con: In the year 2014, I find a ""cash-only"" policy for a restaurant this large, with an average bill of $40-60, to be utterly obnoxious. Even more so, when they push their own ATM, which they collect of fee on. Not sure if this is because they don't want to eat the tiny credit card transaction fee, or if they'd rather keep some of their income ""off the books.""

Those I mean the Indians and Caucasian. Until we made a scene.  And not once did he follow up with us after receiving our food. But made sure to kiss everyone's else ass around us.

Once open, I was quickly seated and served.I ordered the small original Margherita Pizza, enough to feed two people easily. The pizza came out - literally - on a silver platter. It was hot, fresh, and yes, delicious. While this could easily be dismissed as a tourist trap (they do sell souvenir shirts, etc.), there is such a sense of pride and history it is anything but.I would definitely recommend a visit to Lombardi's.

I came here on Friday and we ended up ordering a large mushroom pizza ($23.50), a large pancetta pizza ($23.50), and two of their famous clam pizza ($28.00/each.)I was super excited to finally be able to take a bit of history but was slightly disappointed at the taste. Don't get me wrong, their pizza were decent but definitely not memorable. Instead of being soft and chewy, their dough was a bit dry and flavorless. The cheese was minimal and the toppings were sparing. The only thing that was intrigued me most was their two-dozen claim pizza! Apparently, their clam pizza was part of the restaurant's original menu when they first opened up in 1905. During the turn of the century, NYC had an abundant amount of clams so hence, their clam pizza was borned. Surprisingly, all their restaurants are scattered around the block and therefore waiting is not long. It's a perfect experience for tourists and even locals alike. I would rate their pizza 3 stars but because of their rich history, they earn themselves an extra star for the New York experience which of course is priceless!",3/29/2012,531,489,2084,_x9_cICSRw-52vT9eBNa3A

The atmosphere is exactly what I want from an Italian eatery...Sinatra on in the background, red and white checked table cloths, I love it!! The food is fantastic. Crisp crust, perfect sauce, fresh mozz, can't but swoon over the pie.  I will never visit New York again without stopping at Lombardi's.",11/17/2013,13,7,1,nHHaIL604QSTDSJinKH84Q

1926,Michael W.,1,5,"Simply amazing. I've actually never been here on my own accord, but whenever my friends have visited New York, we seem to end up here somehow. If you know pizza, then you must have heard about Lombardi's. This place has been here for a while, and it's reputation is that it's one of the best spots in the city. Now I've had my share of pizza in New York, and I must say, Lombardi's is pretty damn good. Compared to your other hot spots like Grimaldi's, and the other various places in the city, Lombardi's puts up one hell of a fight. Now if you're coming here, be ready to wait in line. On the weekends, Lombardi's does not take reservations, so you're pretty much out of luck. I've been here on a weekday for lunch, and the wait was 5-10 minutes. On the weekends for dinner, the wait is about an hour. So if you can't wait an hour, then go somewhere else. Otherwise, kill some time at the bar. The pizzeria itself is pretty big. There are two dining areas downstairs, and another one upstairs. They're definitely prepared to seat people here. With any real pizza place, you can only buy them by the pie. At Lombardi's you can either get a small or a large, and then get ready to pay $3 per topping. My favorite combinations are: red peppers and meatball, mushrooms and olives, and mushrooms and sausage. Order any one of those combinations, and you won't be disappointed. Neapolitan pizza will come out pretty quick. All they need to do is stick it in that 900 degree coal oven, and fire that pizza up. Because there are SO many people here, it might actually take 15 minutes. When it does come though, be prepared for some amazing pizza. Now you won't find a whole lot of cheese on here because it is Neapolitan style. On top of that, it might seem a little more wet than other types of pizza. Don't worry, it's supposed to be like that.As far as the taste goes, it is pretty damn good. The crust is crispy, and has a nice little char to it. The toppings and the pizza sauce though, steal the show. The pizza sauce is nice and sweet, without too much tang to it. The toppings are homemade, and you can tell. From the meatballs to the sausage, these toppings taste fresh, and even more amazing on top of your pizza. If you've never had Lombardi's before, you might as well give it a shot. This place has some history behind it, and some amazing pizza to back it up. Just be ready to wait in line.",5/31/2012,751,1045,270,_fGysU48tncAdUlJHbMwXw
1927,Daniel E.,0,4,"We had the Margarita pizza add red onions and sweet Italian sausage. The pizza was very flavorful and had a great texture. Only suggestion is to add more cheese to the pizza. The pizza is only 50% covered with cheese as if they melted cubes onto it. Other thing is that they need to get with the 21st century and take credit cards.  People don't care if the price has to be marked up...they want to pay with a card.

1929,Xenu M.,0,5,"I won't lie. When the host at Lombardi's handed me a vibrating pager that would buzz when my table was ready, I cringed. Generally, if an establishment hands you a pager like this, you are going to be eating food that's on par with the California PIzza Kitchen.""I really hope this isn't terrible,"" I thought. This place is kind of a tourist attraction. Everyone wants to try America's First Pizza, blah blah blah. I became very skeptical when I saw the crowd, and afraid I was going to be wasting precious stomach space. Our pager buzzed within 10 minutes of walking in, which was nice. No one wants to be milling out on the street for extended periods of time. We were sat down and immediately perused the menu. We got the small original pie (good for 2 hungry people), half mushrooms and half meatballs. I also ordered a diet coke, because I wanted something cold and fizzy with my delicious pizza.Now, Lombardi's. When I order a Diet Coke, I didn't mean a Diet RC Cola. Because that's what you brought me. And that's really gross. Anyway. The pizza made up for this Coke Faux Pas. The interior crust was cardboard thin and floppy. It was covered in tangy tomato sauce, salty mozzarella and fresh basil. The outer crust was chewy and delightful - this is the pizza that you can perfect the ""NY Fold"" with. We falcon punched that pizza and it was gone pretty fast. Despite the touristy aspect of this place, I highly recommend it.

I'll premise this by saying I've worked in the food industry for over a decade, so I'm probably more sensitive than normal customers. None of these times are exaggerated. We were sat immediately, which was surprising, but as soon as we were guided through the kitchen to the back seating area, I knew it wasn't a good sign. All the customers looked grumpy and at least 5 tables were sitting with their menus and no drinks. It took close to 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. There was one waitress for the entire section of 10 tables. Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to overworked servers (having been one for years) but she made literally no effort. She wasn't rushing, smiling, apologizing, or generally showing that she cared we had a good time. I even watched as one table flagged down a busboy to get a refill on their drinks, which he brought promptly. A miscommunication led to the waitress bringing another set. Rather than acknowledging her mistake, she scolded the customers for asking the busboy rather than her. The food was meh, took a half hour to arrive. She didn't check on us once but magically appeared to clear our plates and delivery the bill when we were finished. Gotta flip those tables!

A wonderful Caesar dressing that was just perfect.The pizza had a very thin crust, that was perfectly doughy and chewy with a great flavor.

1941,S A.,0,5,"This pizza is amazing. Lombardis is actually the first pizzeria in America! The crust is perfectly thin and crispy, the toppings and cheese are fresh, and the flavors are phenomenal.Like most things in NYC, the pizza is pricey (think about $30 for a large pizza). Between 5 adults we ate 2 large pizzas with 2 1/2 slices leftover. Get the garlic spinach on your pizza, it is AWESOME. We also had mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian sausage as well. I will say, the meat portions are pretty small for a pizza joint. Both the sausage and the pepperoni are thinly sliced rounds, about the size of half dollars.",9/13/2015,0,39,0,6iip8CVXrIfxIbPc9-I0Bg

1944,Alexander T.,0,3,"Calling this place ""authentic"" New York pizza isn't quite right. The pizza here is alright, but the kind of pizza they serve is more classic old Italian style than classic New York City. Think stretchy bunches of cheese, moderate spreads of sauce, and thinner than you'd typically expect crust. Nevertheless, the prices aren't that bad and the ambiance is okay. Fun place to take a friend or family member who is visiting, brag about it being the oldest pizzeria in the US etc., but it won't soon be my go-to spot to satisfy my weekly pizza cravings.",9/4/2011Previous review,466,217,254,YYh8iYLYfgRGRs7cCNJJEg

I thought they had a lot of sugar in the sauce, the coal tasted funny for the crust, wood is so much better since the smell of wood permeates the pizza, etc. I would pass for the hype- I am giving it one extra star because I liked the location, the food is one star.",12/10/2014,1,225,3,yvQrAwYbVZUNN180b8Avbg

The staff was very friendly and efficient about seating everyone, despite the high traffic, which was very impressive; they didn't seem frazzled at all.Our waiter was friendly and took our drink/ food order right away and everything came out in record time! I don't think I've ever been served so fast on a regular evening at Lombardi's haha but I really did appreciate it. As for the food, the margarita pizza did not disappoint! They didn't skimp on the sauce, cheese or size even though it was 5 cents for a small pie. I think the kitchen ran out of bruschetta because they used a thicker type of bread but it's forgiven since they were crazy busy churning out pizza pies all day. The sangria was good but lacked fruit, ice tea could've been better...really wish they had more San Pellegrino in stock though :(They even offered all the diners a heaping plate of celebratory cake to go at the end! and it was heavenly!

Locals are probably reading this and saying ""what a loser"". Well, I can cross that off my list. DONE. 4 stars because of the history and the simplicity of the pizza. I've actually had better pizza in SF (thin crust) but if pizza was this good back in the late 1800's... DAMN. I'm a fan of thin crust pizza (NY style) over deep dish (Chicago style), something about the biting into a thin crust to get that crunch tickles my fancy. That's how a pizza is done. Shopping around the area and eating at the other neighboring eateries we passed this place and made an attempt to come here the following day. Came here around mid-afternoon, the place had a small wait of 10 minutes (usually it's a much long wait but got her after the lunch rowed and before the dinner crowd. There was a party of 5 and we were escorted out of the building and down two doors into another building which happens to be an extension of the restaurant. STRANGE! Ordered simple pizza and sangria and was served fairly quickly.HEFFER-STYLE STATUS.Margarita Pizza ($16) - The pie had 6 slices. Not everyone was eating only a few of us so this was perfect. Slices were decent portions but it is thin crust so one will not just fill you. Kept the pizza simple so we can taste the crust and the sauce. Both very good, i enjoyed the crust and the sauce was kind of saucy for the thin crust s if it wasn't all melted together and was layed on. It wasn't so heavy either, felt feeling great after eating 2 proportionate slices. Will I be back? Yes.. I can't believe I ate at America's FIRST Pizzeria.

It was just okay as i think the clams were a bit too dry and there wasn't much of a sauce on the slice. But my favorite one is the regular one where you can add your own toppings for an additional charge.What i love about this place is that the pizza stays nice and crispy as the crust itself is a thin pizza. And how often that when you get to your second slice, it gets nice and soggy once you put it in your mouth?! It is a bit pricey though ( a pie with toppings can average to over $20. And if your not willing to pay that price, you can just go to 2 bros pizza in St, marks for $1!). But you do get your money's worth",1/29/2015,138,74,22,v4n40aZHWrh6HkRj8IizDg

1965,Dustin T.,0,4,"I've been told that Lombardis is the first pizzeria in the US so obviously I had to check it out.  Came with the gf on a Saturday around 2pmish.... And let me just say, it was packed!  I figured we were well after the lunch crowd but I guess not, haha.  Went in and the hostess said the wait time would be over an hour for two people.  Keep in mind that we were starving.  Since we were out of towners, we definitely wanted to try the pizza before we left NY.  Fortunately, the hostess did mention we could order the pizza for take out.  However, takeout requires an order for a whole pizza and not just slices.  If you want just slices, then you have to wait for seats.  So instead of waiting for seats for over an hour, the takeout only took about 15 minutes.  We customized our whole pizza to spinach, pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms.  The price came out to about $30 and we ordered the smallest size.  Kinda pricey but definitely worth trying.  I must say, walking out of Lombardis restaurant with a whole pizza box... Does seem to draw a lot of attention, haha.  That's about as close to I'll ever feel like a celebrity:-PThe reason I took one star away is for just how crazy the wait time is and the price itself.  Since it is New York, there's pretty much street parking.  Overall, definitely worth going to again if I'm ever in the big apple!  Do people still use that term?",1/22/2015,9,56,388,rO8J-3ZMEkxt6kqy3a6SZg

We had to wait about 15 minutes to get it, but we didn't mind because we were in the mood for some good ol' brick oven pizza. Our waiter was lovely, tended to our needs, etc.We went with Mama's meatballs for an appetizer. Oh la la. The gravy (sauce) was actually to die for. The meatballs were as if my late Italian grandmother herself rolled them in her kitchen. Tender. Delicious. Kind of perfect.For our pizza, we went with the classic margherita pie. We chose panchetta and pepperoni as additional toppings. It might have been everything that I have ever hoped for in a pizza. Easy to eat, fresh ingredients, easy to share, etc.This is a great place if you're exploring the city as a tourist, or maybe you're just trying to rediscover SoHo, Nolita, and Little Italy.

But while my boyfriend, sister and I were complete hungers, we knew that we had to go get pizza in the big apple! Since my three aunts and my mom all were in a ""dire"" need to go to Chinatown instead of joining us for lunch, we decided to go balls to the walls and come here since it was the closest pizza place to us!When I first got in, I was kind of confused about the design of the entire restaurant, it was quite crowded and a maze for us to get to the ""right room"" to be seated at by the waiter. You see tons of waiters flying straight at you as they rush to get the food to their customers. I guess that's alright, I wasn't completely happy though with the ""Excuse me, get out of the way"" looks in the waiters' eyes... Anyways.Once we were seated, I ordered a side of bruschetta because I had just come from studying abroad in Ghana and I reaaaaally wanted something with pesto in it. That was spectacular! The crunch made everything right with the world, and the mix of all the right herbs made it so great. No one else helped me to this one plate of appetizers because we were all waiting for the grand finale!We ordered the margherita pizza with sausages and pepperoni on it. The way they add the cheese onto the pizza makes it look like a fungi delight. That might've sounded really wrong, but it to me sounds so right! The sauce was soooo mouthwatering and the crust was magnificent. I've never tasted such a great pizza before in all of my 21 years. It was just full of authenticity and amazingness that... I can't even explain because you've gotta try it yourself. The greatness of the pizza definitely overlooked the mess of getting seated at our table, which shows in the rating in this review. It really is a New York pizza delight. If you're in the neighborhood (literally) you've gotta try it if you have the chance. It's really, reeeeeally good.",4/28/2014,48,77,50,Z4zrEbjLPe3hrei1QqseAQ

1979,Will C.,0,2,"Lombardi's states it was the first pizzeria in America. That is some serious prestige. I was really, really looking forward to this. I had starved myself all day so that I could devour all six slices of a 14'' pepperoni pizza. I could write a story about my experience. And, that I waited 30 minutes. And, that this is NoLita so there's at least things to see while you wait. But, you don't want that. You want the Pizza Snob's thoughts on this pizza: Tomato sauce: There's just a superfluous amount of tomato sauce. Moreover, it has no flavoring. It's neither sweet nor tangy. It lacks seasoning. It's pretty bland. And, they smother the pizza crust three times over so that the pizza is a dripping mess of tomato sauce. I really hope that they're not using tomato sauce out of a can, but geez... couldn't they spice it up just a bit?Mozzarella: It was hard to taste the mozzarella because the tomato sauce overwhelmed the pepperoni and cheese. Because of the runny tomato sauce foundation, the mozzarella was slipping down the pizza slice and I found myself using the fork to keep putting the cheese back on the slice. Moreover, there just isn't enough cheese. Neither does it have that salty kick that I was expecting.Pepperoni: Where is the flavor? The pepperoni didn't taste like it was cured. It just lacked seasoning. Crust: The crust was really good. It had good thickness, and had good foldability while maintaining a very nice crunch as I ate my way through it. As you lift each slice up, the mozzarella and pepperoni drips onto your plate leaving you with about 50% of the original toppings. And, there's just a lack of flavor explosion. This pizza needs some serious seasoning. Maybe even salt. That pretty much sums up this visit. The ingredients are fine. The pizza is average. And, to some pizza non-snobs, the pizza is great. They have a cool ancient oven that spits these pizzas out and gives it that nice charcoal blackened bottom on the crust. Like I said, the crust is pretty good and a delight to chew through.  Pizza: 2.5 starsCost: 2 stars. Starts at $16 for a basic, plain pizza with zero toppings. Each additional topping is $3. My small pepperoni pizza was $22. CASH ONLY. screw you guys. Service: 1 star. I saw my waitress twice. Service sucked. The staff here is over-worked and they really do make you feel pressured to get the heck outta here so they can put the next party at your table. A relaxed and fine dining experience this is not. Overall: Although this is NY's first pizzeria, I'm not sure that I would even call this pizza a true NY style pie. It's more of a hybrid. And, it's really an average pie, at a high price. I've had much, much better NY style pizza in San Diego. It really does have a sort of touristy feel with a lot of customers posing for pictures or speaking a foreign language. I'm curious as to the percentage of actual NYers that frequent this pizza stop. Not many I can imagine based on my visit. But, I can now say that I ate at Lombardi's. And, now I can say that it is VASTLY OVERRATED. Now, I'm taking the Q train to Di Fara's and taking my chances on waiting 40 minutes to 2 hours in the middle of nowhere for an authentic NY pizza pie made by an old Italian man that has a 25% chance of being blackened beyond capable of being consumed..",4/2/2012,79,260,92,0FUp_4coC1MxoyujWhDdIA

1981,Richard L.,1,3,"The Famous Lombardi's Pizza has become a tourist trap, but even still - their pizza hasn't changed.  I haven't been here in a long time (i mean 5+ years) but from what i remember not much has changed. So what did we order?  A Pizza of course!  It came out - piping hot and crispy...after a nearly 40 minute wait after ordering at late lunch...so no line (something like 2:30 pm on a friday) The restaurant was moderately busy, but nothing like it's normal customers.  With empty tables a plenty and as much experience as the restaurant has, they should be able to pump out pizzas a little faster than 40 minutes or so.  Anyway - so what kind of pizza did we order?  A Pizza w/onions, peppers and sausage.  Nothing too crazy - but not plain.  So what did we get?  A brick oven pizza, cooked very well, a good amount of cheese, but sporadically placed so some sections had very little cheese.  The onions and peppers were tossed about in a good organization as well as the meat.  All the toppings were evenly placed except for the cheese.As for the flavor - the flavor of everything was good - although, the thing crust by the center was a little too thin as the sauce and everything in the middle sogged down and some toppings slipped off the pizza.  That had to be salvaged with fingers back onto the pizza. Overall - is it a good slice?  Very much so.  Best in New York - not so sure, but definitely a good slice.  Worth the money though?  I don't think so.  TL;DR - Tasty pizza, not worth the money though.",6/19/2012,847,734,14,fVcdur3u2KqV0JcA3-Lo6Q
1982,Robbie G.,0,3,Pizza is great if you get past the fact that there is no beer to drink especially because there is no air conditioning inside to cool off to. Loved going to this place before they moved. Also the service isn't very good.,2/22/2016,103,13,3,NEMoQ8Nxvnsvllu7qUb68Q

1984,Kaysee T.,0,4,"I'll admit, I have a soft spot for Lombardi's as the first true New York pizza I experienced when I moved to the city. That said, it truly is exceptional pizza, particularly the white pizza! I love it, and could seriously eat a whole pie of just that. But, I also recommend getting the pizza half-and-half (half white, half margarita), so you can have a bit of tomato flavor between slices of white.Just a note, despite their great pizza, their breadsticks are NOT worth it. Not that there's anything wrong with them, they're just some of the most boring bread products in the world. Definitely not worth it.Finally, expect to be a little crowded and to wait for a while, especially if you come on a weekend. It's a busy place!",2/13/2015,10,295,2,O4K9-shhPkfM8ck5lw7_Sw

So I come to be touristy for the Pizza and because Lombardi's Pizza is known as the first pizzeria in the US and is very well known. So expect to pay a premium.I came with two other friends and split a thing crust Margherita Pizza with sausage (extra for each topping). We sat downstairs, which was a lot more quiet and intimate. The pizza was good, but the price is high in comparison to something that you can get for a lot cheaper. They also accept CASH ONLY and have an ATM inside the restaurant.

To call it anything else but that would not do it justice.The restaurant itself is a maze and they sat us at the very end of the second hall so we were able to walk through the entire thing.I was recommended the Margherita pizza and white pizza by a friend. They were great. The pizzas aren't overly doused in toppings but the ingredients are very fresh. The service was about right for a full restaurant of corridors this length and the food was sure worth the wait.

If you get half and half they still charge you the same price. More for your money and you can try more toppings! The pepperoni is better than the ham, and it was crunchy and delicious.

So why not try the original pizzeria located in little Italy? Ladies and Gentlemen the hype is real. We had a half pepperoni half margherita pizza. So fucking delicious. We must have came before the rush because it took us less than 15 minutes to be seated. So if you're in New York and want some good ass pizza, stop by Lombardi's.*Updated 7/12/18 it's been about 4 years since we last came here and we couldn't wait to come back. Our first experience was mind blowing and the pizza was by far the best I've had. This time not so much. We brought our son to New York and he wanted to try some really good pizza. I mean what kid doesn't like pizza right?  We got our pizza and it wasn't as good as it was when we first came here 4 years ago. Not enough sauce, crust was meh, and the pizza wasn't even really hot. Strange because we came right at lunch time. It still tasted good but not the original 5  rating I gave it previously.

2003,Crystal C.,0,3,Not impressed. The quality is good but I find it hard to justify the price. Their small Margherita (6slices) is $21 and the white pizza is $23. The large pies are a little under $30. For each extra topping it's $4-6. Also their soda doesn't include refills and it's priced at almost $3. I think you are just paying for the name.

And the end of the day when its all said and done, a true foodie doesn't want some crazy concoction - they want something flavorful and fresh and done right. Lombardi's is that place. A twenty minute wait for a party of 9 on a Sunday for a slightly early dinner came out to more of a 10 minute wait. The staff  - accommodating. Seating - quaint and excellent as we were seated upstairs overlooking a cute little courtyard.Three items i would totally recommend when you get to Lombardi's: CLAM PIE, MARGHERITA  PIE, and their CAESAR SALAD. The CLAM PIE is just delish! So tasty and not an ounce of ocean in it. Their MARGHERITA is everything you would expect in a great margherita pizza. Thin, a little sweet, warm and crisp and crunchy. And their CAESAR SALAD: with non-fishy anchovies. Need you ask more of a Cesar salad prepped right?The only negative thing i have to say about pizza is that the crust can get really dry from the flour and coal oven.

The pizza is also thin, so you can eat a bunch of slices without feeling like a complete fatass.We also got the breadsticks, which I wasn't too fond of.

Seems as if it were overworked. Sauce goes on very very thin to the point that it dries out at the edges. Sauce itself seems right out of the can. No chunks, bitter and acidic with no seasoning.Cheese. Paper thin slices of low quality Mozz.

A small can feed 2 people so plan accordingly. Toppings cost $3 each so don't overdo it unless you want to break the bank.If you're looking to beat the long lines make sure to get in before rush hour.

It was fairly busy on a Friday night [however nowhere near as busy as Lou Malnati's in Chicago] but we were seated within 20 minutes. We were lead through the kitchen to a seating area that looked like it was an additional expansion. We ordered breadsticks and two margherita pizzas, one with spinach, the other with mushrooms. Our breadsticks came after about 15 minutes of wait. They were tough, dry and tasteless. The breadsticks were stiff - I've had better breadsticks from Domino's. Even dipped with olive oil and their dipping marinara, no one from our party enjoyed them. The pizzas were disappointing, given the hype. The crust was burnt and bitter, the cheese was very sparse, and our toppings tasted bland. After our $81 meal, we realized we had fallen for a tourist trap - don't waste your money here and go grab a $2 slice from a corner store, you'll be more satisfied and you'll save some money.",5/30/2015,0,14,8,iosZKkVQCT0lRQRjVcib0A

They do the Scott's Pizza Tour here, but save your money and just get a pizza here. I got half cheese, and half beef meatballs and had 4 slices out the small thin crust one to myself. Waitress is busy, so look at the menu before going and order fast. I enjoyed eating here solo. Many people here were tourists with either their partners, or a huge crowd.

2035,Marci A.,0,2,"Honestly this place is over-rated. We ordered a large pie half white and half margherita, two bottle beers and a caesar salad and spent $70! The beers were warm at best not cold so that was upsetting. Also, our waiter was all over the place bc they sat him 8 tables so he wasn't as attentive and we had to wait for him a lot. Worst of all the place is CASH ONLY, who does that? This is NYC in 2014 please upgrade! The margherita pizza was exceptional but even then it was too pricey, the white pizza was good but it has way too much garlic. All in all, I'm glad I came and I tried it but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, not when there's another 4 pizzerias around the block with better service, better pizza and cheaper prices. I feel like this is a tourist trap, they get you by saying it's the first pizzeria in America but they fall short. Skip it if you can, it's not worth it.",12/24/2014,63,419,244,Z0NsWHG8sTXbrIdCkOqE6Q

It was a little pricey for pizza, but still really good. The only thing that was strange about the location was that the set up was really weird.

After some window shopping in the area, we returned just in time and was led through the twists and turns of the place. We were definitely in the company of fellow visitors as cameras were flashing, utensils were utilized. I grew up on Lou Malnati's deep dish but this ain't no fork 'n knife affair! I know I'm in the same boat as some of them, but you don't roll up a slice and stab it with your fork (as I shockingly witnessed at the table next to me). A NY-friend once mentioned in a convo a while back... it's all about the fold! Respect. The margherita pizza harbored just the right tomato-sweet-tangyness. My only qualms were about the cheese-- I probably would've liked a little more mozzarella. The area in which we were seated seemed like a cozy hallway. Even though we weren't located right next to the exit, every time somebody left we'd get hit with a gust of 10-degree chilliness. We had to eat fast, 'cause we could see our pizza shivering.

When the pager finally buzzed we were escorted into the incredibly cramped space (part of the New York charm perhaps?). After the waitress took our order we waited 20 minutes without any sign of our pizza. When I asked one of the servers if he could help check up on our order he was very curt and told us that it was ""a busy day"" and that he could not make any promises. I had not even asked for an ETA, just a simple check! 10 to 15 minutes later the pizza finally came and thankfully it was absolutely delicious! The marinara sauce was fresh and tasty, lathered on a thin crust and topped with mozarella, garlic sauteed spinach (mm-mm!), and sweet italian sausages. Every slice was full of flavor but not the least bit greasy. My friend and I took on the large 8-slice pizza easily.

For my table, we ordered the white pizza and that was just so different from any other types of pizza that I can still remember how it tastes. It's super creamy and the pizzas are huge.

I myself am a business owner and understand that cash is king and not accepting credit card has its perks and flaws. That being said offering an in-house ATM  so you can bring in more customers is awesome, but charging them a fee of $3.25 so they can pay for YOUR service and restaurants food doesnt sit right with me.

The food here simply taste better and fresher than any other spot I have been to. The service and location are perfect a few blocks walking distance from the trains but worth the hike.

2061,Stephanie L.,0,5,"You know this place is legit when you see a group of four burly Italian men outside of the restaurant smoking cigars! The restaurant is definitely more spacious in comparison to other restaurants around the city and thank goodness it is because the wait would have been much longer than just 30 minutes especially for how good it was. The service was on point as was the food.We got a small (~$16 for 6 slices) between the two of us and it was more than enough. Got the Margherita and added fresh ricotta, wild mushrooms and Italian sausage. Of course the pizza here is thin crust (would haven't have it any other way in the Big Apple). It wasn't oily but, held the toppings well and the sauce was more tart then I was used to which, I found really enjoyable. It balanced out the heavier flavors in the toppings. The ricotta that came on this pizza was honestly to die for. I loved that they piped it onto the pizza..it's incredibly creamy and smooth but, still had a bit of grittiness to it. What's great is that the cheese is also all locally sourced from a cheese shop just around the corner!The wild mushrooms made the pizza a little watery but, I'll make the sacrifice since they used a great variety of mushrooms. Sausage was also a great addition to the subtle flavors of the pizza.Lombardi's represents the food culture of New York so well..and it's definitely a place you want to eat at if you're visiting. And if you're a local..I'm jealous! You haven't had good, authentic New York style pizza until you've tried this place.",11/17/2011,339,358,297,i-2Ih2Vd6FwQYK1b6dpAhg

2064,Steve W.,0,4,"I am not a New Yorker and I have never had a New York style pizza nor have I ever been to this great city. Like many I do my research on where to find good eats, and based on location and the time restriction I had for my 17 hour day in NY, I decided on this place, the ""original"" pizza pie. Upon our 3 o'clock arrival, we were happily greeted by the hostess and seated promptly, so far so good! Our server was alright, which is why I gave 4 stars. The service was below average in my opinion, no personality. Not bad, just, ok. We ordered a large half original margherita, and the other half was a white pizza. The problem I had was that I was not aware the pie didn't come with a meat choice, at least go my knowledge. Would have been nice to have pepperoni, but I was not about to complain, so we went without and it was still pretty amazing!!! We asked for extra cheesy on the margherita half just because based on some pictures it looked very lite on the cheese side. Bad choice. The cheese is thick and heavy, so that made the thin dough just to hard to handle, although was still fun to eat! The sauce was amazing, ""light and sweet,"" just the right consistency to keep it balanced and not overpowering whatsoever! The white pizza is a gem, it's absolutely incredible!! After taking my first bite, I stepped into what I can only describe as ""the pizza room of heaven."" Absolutely fabulous! Not to thick but just oh so right to satisfy my pizza obsession! I would go back just for the white pizza! The dough was ok, it had a basic flavor, didn't stand out to me at all. This was without a doubt the best pizza I had, from a buffalonians perspective. Best in NYC? I don't know. What I do know is this, if your looking for a great place to share a great piece of pizza, and sit back and enjoy some drinks and have a great time, this place is for you! Loved it! Would I go back, yes! Just without the extra cheese, maybe extra pepperoni to make up for what I missed out this time!",7/6/2017Previous review,22,50,85,ML4SkVxhmbIadm5cracKRQ
2065,Amir H.,0,4,"Went to Lombardi's on Scott's Walking Pizza Tour (a wonder-tour that I would recommend to all) and was so excited to try what should have, without a doubt, been the best pizza I would ever try. Verdict? Really tasty pizza, but regrettably not the best I ever sank my teeth into. The tour consisted of consuming a slice of a classic margherita pizza. Traditional tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and basil. The first thing I really liked was the crispy, thin crust. Very nice and perfectly cooked, it must be said. As for the sauce, it was very good! It was sweet and a little acidic, but delicious. The cheese was where I was disappointed. The mozzarella was good, but it wasn't as ""hot"" as I expected. Biting into the cheese it was a little warm and therefore not as tasty. The basil on top was good though, but anyone can add basil on top of pizza ;) Now, the fact that Lombardi's has historic origins is notable, and I rather enjoyed its location deep within Little Italy, but ultimately, I've been to enough pizza places inside and outside of New York where places know how to get a thin, crispy crust, and lay it on with good sauce and toppings. The margherita pizza is not hard to decipher, and many a pizza joint has offered an alternative that beats Lombardi's. That being said, being in New York and being a patron of a pizza trailblazer like Lombardi's is important to experience once, but you will pay a premium for it.",6/20/2014,393,117,8,_TFpha0Y3qqYstsElgSVag

We ordered the margherita pizza with crushed garlic and mushrooms.  The garlic was whole cloves so we just picked it off. The cheese was just okay but the sauce was pretty good.  I didn't like that they don't offer free refills. A bit overpriced for what it was. They only accept cash.

2068,Lissa G.,1,4,"3.75, but I'll round up for history.Being a first-time visitor to NYC, we had to try some pizza and debated between Grimaldi's and Lombardi's, as so many have done before us.  Lombardi's was closer and they were the first pizzeria, so we went with that.So thankful that we only waited about 10-15 minutes for a table. Very few things are worth waiting hours for, and this is no different. We were seated downstairs in their wine room and were surrounded by some seriously annoying tourists.  Now, of course, we're tourists too, but not the annoying kind.  We don't walk in to a NYC pizzeria and ask about deep dish pizza, or ask about toppings not on the menu, or about having a pizza toppings split 4 different ways. Just order already! It was our turn and we made it very easy for the waiter, Margherita Pizza (their speciality), side of meatballs, and chianti.  Meatballs were moist and flavorful, pizza was good, but needed a bit more salt and more flavor and crisp in the crust, and chianti was chianti. It was good!  Would I eat this pizza again? Yes, but only if the wait were 15 minutes or less.  It's a fine pizza, but nothing to rave about or to wait a long time for. I thought it would be better; perhaps I built it up too much.",8/3/2014,1081,997,100,-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw

I was in heaven when I took a bite of my slice. The sauce was so good! All of our toppings were nice and fresh. To top off the pizza we ordered a bottle of wine.

2076,Rebecca R.,0,3,"Okay so. I'm going to be one of those ""wanted to love it, but just couldn't"" people.  I like to read reviews before I visit places like this to manage my expectations.Ordered traditional Margarita pizza and judged on the 3 pillars of pizza...1. Crust. This was really good! Thin, but not too much.2. Sauce. Amazing. Order more of this on the side to dip your pizza crust in.3. Cheese. FAIL. For a $23 pizza you should really be getting more cheese. I understand this style of pizza is meant to lack cheese. But in this case it made me scream ""Where's the Mutz??""As someone discussed, yes the soda does taste weird.Also... As we were paying our server he suggested for us to try another amazing pizza place in Brooklyn. Never a good sign when your server is suggesting you go elsewhere?Anyway it would unfortunately appear as though this place is just a tourist trap.

I ordered a large 18"" half margherita (plain: cheese & tomato) and half pancetta (italian bacon) & spinach. The $23 price tag in my opinion is really expensive considering too it's $2 per topping on half of the pizza -OR- $3 per topping on the whole pizza. I heard from my local NY friend that Little Italy is overpriced because the shops know that a lot of tourists visit. Oh well, I had to try it and now I know. Don't get me wrong though, it's great pizza...yet greatly overpriced.

Where the loose the point?1) paper plates.  Really you are a sidewalk pizza by slice joint2) cash only.      We are in 2017. They are many ways to accept payments. If for any reason you still do not want to get to new technologies just to avoid charges from bank than you are not a business where I repeat as customers.     Note. The security and life of customers, persons, employees,cashier and any human has more value than 3-5% fee of a bank.    In this way they are kind of taking advantage of their name as first pizzeria.  In a regular basis i just do not eat on cash basis i places.      Just a last note all owners in little Italy should  get together and aligned in order to make a strategy to face EATALY.  In short words right now EATALY offer more variety, more genuine, better price in a 100%Italy environment",7/24/2017,0,34,0,ZOhz2NXA__4LFIJDEby4cw

Garlic roasted spinach and meatballs (beef and pork) as our toppings. The slices were the most thinnest pizza slices I have ever had in my life. I loved it. I had to fold them up so none of my toppings would fall off. The cheese was so soft. Not the rubbery kind we have in LA. We had juicy meatballs and the spinach was full of garlic flavor. It was heavenly! This place is bigger than you think. We sat in the front and I thought it was small as heck but one of their employees led us through this long maze through their kitchen and to the back. It was still a narrow long room, and the tables and chairs were totally cramped, but it wasn't too uncomfortable. This place was definitely a winner. Next stop.

Keep in mind: if you go after 4 PM, you will have to wait a minimum of half an hour for your pizza to arrive, as our waiter informed us. I kept having to repeat in my mind ""don't kill the messenger, don't kill the messenger"". None of us had eaten six hours prior...Finally our pizza arrived and the first bite was pure bliss. I don't know where my pizza slice disappeared to since I literally inhaled the pizza. All I kept thinking was ""this is the best pizza I have ever had"". I figured it was my hunger talking. When I moved on to my second slice, I think I may have shed a tear. The crust was delicious and salted perfectly. The sauce was so flavorful and poured on generously. The cheese tasted like goat mozzarella cheese, but I can't put my finger on it. What really took the pizza to a whole other level was the sautéed garlic spinach!All I can say is that everything was perfection on that pizza. You're going to come here and you will marvel in the deliciousness of this pizza. You will get the regular pizza with sautéed spinach. You will cry out of pure pleasure.

Lombardi's though doesn't need to make a great meatball because it's one of the best representations of NY pizza around and definitely a favorite.  In fact it was so good that my gf made us take the last few slices to go and she carried it around with her for 5 hours to try and find someone to give it to.  She couldn't bare the thought of this pizza going to waste.   Do yourself a favor and order one of these bad boys for yourself.

I've had the pepperoni which is delicious, but to my surprise the cheese is just as good. They use fresh mozzarella and are not stingy with it. But seriously, the history (opened in 1905) should afford it a spot on your NYC Bucket List. I mean it's acknowledged by the Pizza Hall of Fame as the first pizzeria in the US.

It is cash only, but they have an ATM onsite. Ordered the original pizza with half pepperoni and half sausage. Beer on tap was fresh and cold. The pizza was exactly as I remember it.

How ever there is an ATM inside the restaurant. The decor is just brilliant and apt for the pizza place. Coming to the did itself. It's just fresh fresh and fresh. The cheese is the killer. My favorite is the WHITE PIZZA. Simply order that and you will be happy you made the trip and a wine to go with it as well.",1/3/2015,24,127,221,hPTGJwxFYRxKuUxmttOX9A

This place is absolutely amazing all around from decent wait times, the bartender Ricky, the waitress (sorry forgot her name) and the food - A+ all around! I had the margherita and white pizza - both best I've EVER had. And my goodness DO NOT skip out on the wine. I had one bottle there and one to take home $35/bottle. Also if you're not a big fan of the more traditional pizzas you can order calzones and pick your own toppings. Two members of our part had the calzones: pepperoni & sausage and pepperoni & red pepper both finished it and they were huge. I went to a ton of places in NY and this is the only place that I am craving miserably :*(Oh FYI, margherita pizzas, well traditional italian pizzas in general are not supposed to be loaded with cheese so ask for extra if you really need it or go w/ the calzone ;]",3/18/2014,23,13,25,VS-_5pSJJvwLEn8QnoPYiw

2128,Christina Y.,0,2,Tourist trap. I came here 10 years ago and the pizza was amazing. Today the pizza is mediocre. We ordered one plain margarita pie and one with Breaded eggplant. The eggplant was bland. We were served with plastic cups and paper plates which was quite off putting for a sit down pizzeria.

2130,Kristen B.,0,2,"Oh, people... this place is so overrated!! I grew up in NY, I'm not a tourist here to try ""authentic"" pizza. I eat authentic pizza on a weekly basis. There are so many tastier options! I have a feeling the majority of the reviewers don't have much of a benchmark to compare it to.We ordered the margherita with fresh mushrooms. The amount of mushrooms they put on was great, considering it was $4 for the topping, I didn't feel like we got ripped off. My biggest issue was the fact that the dough has no flavor. None. The consistency was spot on, but I shouldn't feel like I'm eating a communion wafer. Second, the sauce was literally just fresh tomatoes, which is fantastic on one level, but it definitely needed garlic salt pepper and anything else they wanted to add- it's got no flavor aside from fresh acidic tomatoes. Again- this wouldn't be such an issue if the crust had flavor. Finally, the mozzarella was unsalted. Altogether, this amounted to me adding salt, pepper, garlic powder (which, in an italian restaurant in NYC shouldn't even be a consideration- where was the fresh garlic???), and red pepper flakes to make it taste like anything. Such a shame. I went once, but I will not go back. For a better NYC pizza taste, without the wait, go to Adrienne's Pizza Bar on Stone Street.

2137,Buggy Z.,0,5,"In my search for the best pizza in New York, I was recommended Lombardis by a few friends, their tagline being America's first Pizzeria.  So my second weekend in New York, I decided to give this place a try.  I was not disappointed: to this date, Lombardis is the best pizza I ever had.  Lombardis consists of five dining rooms, so it is quite big for a restaurant in Little Italy.  One of my friends arrived early, and they refused to seat us all until our entire party had arrived.  Makes sense, but a bit annoying.  However, as soon as the whole party arrived, we were promptly seated, and ordered two small pizzas: the regular pizza with tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and anchovies.  One thing nice about Lombardis is that you can put toppings on one side of the pizza for a dollar less, so everyone can get what they want without having to pick off toppings or order another pizza.  Well if you don't have too many people sharing that is...The pizza was amazing.  In a thin, thin, crust, the pizzas were served to us straight out of the oven and the fresh globs of mozzarella, tomato chunks, romano, fresh basil, and toppings melted in my mouth.  I just wanted the taste to stay, before it all went away.  Everything was perfect, and the ingredients were put together in just the right amount.  They just got along perfectly.  And the crust was thin but not super crispy, just the way I like it, and had obviously been hand tossed with care that was evident in the even texture throughout.  This pizza is just as delicious as leftovers the next day: just pop the slices into the oven for 5-10 minutes, and you almost have something as good as the original.By the way, this place only takes cash, so be sure to have some beforehand.  There's also an ATM machine in the restaurant in the case of forgetfulness...Parting Thought: LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOMBARDIS.  I guess its been my secret crush for a while, I just didn't realize it until now.",8/21/2011,242,307,748,KIsyd8vg5cYmedoc-dcz5A

2139,Chelle N.,0,5,"Definitely definitely lives up to the hype.  The way it works is that the pizzas start off as a basic Martguerita Pizza and you can add on whatever toppings you want for $3 each, $2 for half a pizza.  The toppings can add up pretty fast this way...luckily, the pizza and toppings are already so delicious that you can just keep it simple and still have one of the best pizzas you'll ever taste.  I ordered a Meatball and Mushroom and I was so happy with it.  It was my first time having meatballs on a pizza and it was so good that even after my friends and I got full, we were still picking off the meatballs on the leftover pizza slices because we couldn't bear the thought of wasting something that's so yummy!Two weeks later and I'm back in Los Angeles, still craving Lombardi's pizza.  Sigh til next time :(TIPS:-  Avoid rush hours.  This place is pretty much tourist central and you're likely to wait an hour or two for a table.  I got really lucky and got a table right away since I went at 2:30 PM.- Keep your pizzas simple.  - Order meatballs as a topping.",9/11/2011,60,46,145,r1RsgJt1R196r7zcOHkRAQ

2144,Randy M.,0,4,"I had forgotten that every time I go to Lombardi's I feel like a total loser New Yorker.  But the pizza is indeed good.For some context, I was a big fan and advocate of Lombardi's Pizza in the '90s, before Lombardi's Pizza expanded into the bar next door and became ""Lombardi's(TM) Original Napoletana Pizzeria, America's First Pizzeria"", adopted a huge bright obnoxious awning touting a Zagat rating and some quotes, and started printing and selling T-Shirts that say things like ""My parents ate at Lombardi's(TM) and all I got was this T Shirt"" and ""I ate at Lombardi's(TM)"".  I suppose I can't blame them for cashing in though...I'ts just sad that us New Yorkers who enjoyed ""that awesome hole-in-the-wall pizza place Lombardi's"" had to turn it over to the tourists.  But what can you do.Anyway, I found myself walking by Lombardi's today at lunchtime.  It wasn't crowded and so I said What the Hell and walked in.  It's been at least 5 years since I've had the pizza, and my tastes have changed a lot since then.  Particularly, my tastes for pizza have changed, as amazing brick oven pizza places have opened like Motorino, Keste, etc.  Ordered a small Margarita Pizza, half pepperoni.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed what came out of the oven.  The sauce was tangy, the crust was charred slightly, but still soft and a little chewy, and the cheese was well proportioned and tasty.  It was a solid pie, and well above the likes of your average corner pizza place.Service was adequate, if a little on the slow side and dry.  But they got the job done.I drank water.Overall, if you can stand the touristy scene, its a pretty good representation of NY style pizza.  I would question their claims of bringing the pizza to America, but whatever.",8/22/2013,25,29,0,o7RWzdlvM8xLLQ-1qxjRrQ

2148,Dan G.,1,5,"Lombardi's was NYC's first pizzeria and they have been cranking pizzas out of their coalfired oven for over a century. They have certainly perfected their craft. This pizza is as good as it gets. They can get pretty busy here and we were fortunate to get here early and seated directly. A pizza beatdown then ensued. We opted for the large pie with pancetta and sweet sausage on one half and kalamata olives and wild mushrooms on the other. In the blink of an eye our pizza arrived. Amazed, we were told that they are in the oven for only 3-4 minutes. Wow, incredibly tasty pizza with a perfectly charred crust. It attracts a lot of tourists as evidenced by the rubes next to us. No, pancetta is not a cheese. No, you can't get a sausage pie without a Margarita. Yes, ricotta is what is in raviolis. Whoa! I wanted to throw these idiots out of here myself. You don't deserve to eat this masterpiece. We however were on a mission. And like the pro athlete rising above the heckling of a hostile environment, there was no way we would be denied. My wife and I put away the entire large pie and a pitcher of brew. They have a good selection of draft beers and if you want a warm up, they have many apps for the choosing. Lombardi's dough recipe has been passed through generations. The San Marzano tomatoes create a tangy sauce that is perfectly complemented by the fresh mozzarella and basil. The oven is really the star here. It is huge and hot. They work your pizza with long pizza peels like pool skimmers. The result is a perfectly charred and slightly crisp crust. This is the original NYC pizza and fittingly sets the bar for all others.",7/22/2009,653,885,2149,brQ7OjB6f9nXWGk45A9A3g

2158,Amy H.,0,4,"I was soooo eggcited to see what this New York pizza was allll about. I know Chicago has deep dish and those New Yorkers fold their pizza in half. I was so suprised to see that at 6:30pm there was no crowd at all. I was still full from all the Chinatown food but since Little Italy is so close and there was no crowd, we just got dinner anyways. The pizza gets quite expensive, especiallly when you add all the toppings. The basic pizza is $20 or so and each topping is an additional $2. We got the pizza with pepperoni, meatballs, and spinach and I would say that is the best combo possible. Pepperoni was small and crispy and I much rather have the bigger pieces and the spinach just added texture to the pizza. I absolutely lovedd the meatballs though. It seemed very NY to order meatballs on a pizza and it was a great choice. The two of us had 2-3 slices each so the smallest pizza could easily feed three people. I guess what makes this a ""New York"" pizza is that it is baked in a coal oven so there were black ashy spots on the bottom. I still cant really taste a difference but oh well, I had NY pizza! The crust was thin and crispy which I dont really prefer and it reminded me of Cheeseboard. Supposedly this is the first pizzeria in the US? If that is correct, thats pretty legit :)**TIPS**1) The smallest sized pizza will cost around $30 with toppings and can be split among three girls or two guys.2) Get the meatballs on your pizza!!!3) Enjoy!",9/16/2013,1287,1345,2197,kK0QDyfeSwcZl4gGilnW7w

I believe it was the pepperoni sausage pie. Sausage is the answer to world's persnickety eaters. I'll drink to that. Fun fact: This is America's First Pizzeria circa 1905.

2166,Tory L.,0,4,"Had lunch here today and it was my first ever trip to what claims to be the first Pizzeria in the country. So basically its like one of those things you have to do once as a New Yorker,like watching the ball drop or seeing the tree lighting etc.  The place was crowded at noon on the Monday before Christmas with tourists in town for the holidays and most were of the European variety. The service was fine,I know lots of people complain about the service but it seemed fine to me.  The place has lots of old school trappings (no CCs and only 1 bathroom). We ordered the classic Margherita and it wasnt a bad pie at all. The sauce had lots of bite to it,spicier than I would expect a tourist spot to be. The Mozz was fresh as was the basil.  The crust was good with a nice char. Not the best pizza in NY, not worth the price tag but its an institution and deserves to be tried.",12/21/2015,299,365,906,sGJXg-dzsGSnstkDI5Nb1A
2167,Joshua Q.,0,2,"CASH ONLY. This place is completely for tourists. There's usually a pretty long wait, but you can occupy yourself by taking pictures with the Statue of Liberty out front that visitors seem to think is the real thing.The pizzas are big and the service is generally good. The pizzas are not bad, but not great. Watch out, because you WILL get charged for every little thing. And check your bill (particularly the tax) because it's been wrong the two times I've been there. The server will immediately correct it, so that makes me suspicious.Overall, if you're visiting NYC and HAVE to have pizza and don't have time to go anywhere else, this place is OK. Otherwise, find someplace better!",1/26/2014,0,19,0,du1mlmxqKNP8wJk-jr7GHg
2168,Joecool M.,0,4,"We ordered the original margherita with pepperoni and sweet roasted peppers. Delicious! If you're sharing a large pie with 3 hungry people, plan on getting 2 instead of 1.

2169,Caitlin W.,0,3,"Came here with friends this past weekend to cross it off the bucket list, it is the oldest pizzeria in America after all and being born and raised in NJ, I love pizza. We were a party of 5 and seated after about 20 minutes around 4 on a Saturday - so all in not too bad but when we left the wait seemed much longer. Being lead to our table we were brought through the kitchen and up a flight of stairs to an additional dining room was spacious and quiet which was a plus. After reviewing what is a pretty small menu we ordered the antipasto and bruschetta as appetizers. For the price I wouldn't recommend the antipasto but the bruschetta was pretty good (nothing spectacular). But on to what you really want to hear about - the pizza. We ordered one plain margherita and a margherita with Italian sausage. I would have liked to order the clam pie but no one else that I was with was interested, so I will probably be back with other seafood lovers. The pizzas arrived after 25 minutes or so and at first glance looked a little too saucy for my liking. Taking the first bite I enjoyed the thin crust but instantly knew this was not going to be the best pizza I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, it was very good - I enjoyed the thin crust which had a great crunch but I just felt like something was missing. In the end, if you're just visiting the area I think you can find a better slice that comes with a better price and less of a wait. But if you're from the city/jersey and are looking for something fun to do - it was an experience with some good pizza involved too!",2/17/2014,3,12,4,a3hu8neMK7a-z9amkDXJHQ
2170,Judy F.,1,3,"12 of us had dinner here.  We ordered 2 clam pies ($16 each, I think) and 2 large pies each ($18 each, I think) with 2 toppings ($3.25 per topping, I think).  And a pitcher of soda.  Split the bill, we each paid $13.  That's reasonably priced, IMO.  The pizza crust here is almost thin, just enough to savor the toppings & to hold the toppings & sauce & mozzarella chs.  The maitre d' was nice.  Heck, the staff were nice to all of us.",11/3/2011,157,387,267,tFMFlmqO6dI7O7CF1wyAtg
2171,Chris R.,1,5,"Don't you know that every pizza in NYC advertises as the best pizza in the city? Don't believe them. This is it! I come from an Italian family that owned a NY pizzeria. We are very discerning about our pie. And it's history proves it has what it takes to stand the test of time. I personally love the meatballs... basically because they taste almost the same as our generations old family recipe and I don't have to make them. :) I do not visit NYC without going to Lombardi's. Note that the wait time for a table can be long during prime dinner hours so if you have flexibility, go for lunch or an early or late dinner. This place is HEAVEN. My only regret i that I wasn't able to bring my grandfather here. He'd have loved this place...",4/18/2014,92,88,20,e72y-DWRyKX8-amOFpj4Mg
2172,Reynaldo P.,0,5,"No trip to NYC is complete without a trip to Little Italy to get my Lombardis fix. I have waited as much as an hour and it is worth every time. Lunch is usually faster than dinner and less crowded. Bar area is very small, and prices are different (i.e. More Expensive) than the restaurant. They claim to be first pizza in America. Same claim in Brooklyn's Grimaldi's. I don't argue with pizza royalty. But Lombardis is easier to get to, restaurant itself is a landmark and pizza is amazing. Consistently great is not something you can say of most pizza places. I discovered them in 1999 and have not been disappointed once. A word of advice for parents of young kids. They use real mozzarella here. Some kids find that different as they are used to the shredded kind. That is up to you if you think it will affect their judgment. My kids were past that barrier by the first bite. It is in their top 5 places to eat.",3/3/2015,56,13,21,U0n61Hgb_1ZGdOIeQZN8cg

It isn't so much that it's bad - it's good! Sure! Good pizza. Thank you for your pizza. What it isn't is great. It isn't amazing. It's better than one of the 42,000,000 Famous Ray's.

2187,Ryan R.,0,2,I hate restaurants that trade off their past success. Lombardis is just one of those places. I brought my sons to experience NYCs first pizzeria. What a disappointment. White pizza was inedible. Breadsticks only marginally better. Tomato sauce was very good but quickly got cold on sparsely cheesed Magherita. Crust was like a run of the mill brick oven. Good but not a show stopper.Place wasn't busy at all around 1pm on Saturday so service was good. Although waiter seemed nonplussed we ate only one slice of the White pizza and didn't want a box. I get the impression nothing has voluntarily been taken off a bill since the late 50s.50 years ago this might have been top of the line. Since then a lot of places run circles around this one. Stop in if you walk by but avoid the mess they call a white pizza. Please don't make a special trip. So many better places in NYC.PsWent to Peter Lugars the night before.

The whole pizza was very forgetful and unseasoned, on the verge of being bland and tasting like cardboard. I why the ratings for Lombardi's has not gone down. I'm sure at one point the pizza was amazing but it's time to either throw in some salt or throw in the mofo towel. I've crossed this place off my list and will not be back.

Nothing extraordinary.  Heard a great deal about Lombardi's Pizza, how it's so good and always packed with people outside waiting to get a slice, or pie for that matter. Just so happened I was around the area on a late Friday night with plenty of open tables in the front dining room.... but for whatever reasons, they wanted to put us in the back room and somewhere in the corner. Did not like that and definitely did not appreciate it. Had to ask to be re-seated.  For $20+ a pie, I don't see what the fuss was all about... i guess the thin crust with fresh tomato sauce wasn't enough to make this a good pizza experience.",11/24/2013,56,367,438,EW5Xf4NVT9lKfLDG88ysyg
2191,Tina C.,1,5,"Following Sunday morning service, who with a friend through our faith, we ventured to Lombardi's Pizza for an indulgence on the small fourteen inch Margharita pizza at $20.50. Price is reasonable for our bill totaled $25.75.  Lombardi's Pizza surely is no disappointment as per the numerous genre of reviews and critiques throughout their tenure in the pizza industry. Powered by coal oven as oppose to a conventional oven for the taste difference is embedded in the crust. My friend being a typical male yearned for a drink, an unusual nonalcoholic drink, the Italian soda at $3.00 which intrigue my sweetly senses. We customized our choice for toppings of half red onion and half extra Mozzarella.  Lombardi's is one of the good quality pizza that I've indulged for a long time.  The red onion made a difference in flavor as personally I prefer Vidalia onion.  The basil is small presence to inhance flavor which I like a bigger presence as I also need a stronger Italian presence of food and more.  Lombardi's is truly New York through and through from preparation to taste to Italian New York.Decor and atmosphere is very classic and has a vintage vineyard look for we sat on the lower level with a wine cellar backdrop.  The air conditioner works well on the lower level of less hustle and bustle from the upper level for patrons hanging around the bar.  Customer service is professional and attentive who they can hone their interpersonal skills of our waiter and bar tender to kindly produce change for a $20.00 bill.N.B.  Cash only as Lombardi's Pizza do not accept credit or debit cards in any form.",7/24/2011,2018,4229,10103,syvwUKQJ4OYfmL_ixVLMeQ

Watery sauce, soggy crust, one small piece of cheese for the entire pie. It was awful! Not only that, but the service was lost terrible. Took about 15 minutes to get greeted after I was seated.

The small had 6 pieces which was more than enough for two. The crust was thin and crispy but a little salty. I loved the tomato sauce and the meatball and they seem to have more extensive selection in their menu than Brimaldi's. I think there's pros and cons and its really personal preference.

2203,Melissa I.,0,3,"We came to NYC for the US Open and of course wanted to eat the best Pizza. Lombardis claims to not only be the first pizza place but the best pizza on the planet. Lots of hype and expectation. We went here right when they opened as that's really the only way to get in quickly and not wait to be seated over an hour. The servers remind me like Europe, they're a little slow to get drink orders and don't come around for at least 15 mins to take order and expect you to order everything at a time. While this works in Europe and doesn't really bother me that much but we are in NYC and everyone is in a hurry lol. We have had pizza from around the world and throughout the US. We started with the Meatballs, while we could tell they were made with a proprietary blend of ingredients and well cooked, I would argue that they were made fresh that morning as they came out on the cool side, barely room temperature, this should have been caught by the server or line chef. The pizza was good but far from the best on the planet. It was good quality and tasted good but the best?  Gotta do better than that sorry. That's the problem with claims like that, can't live up to expectation. It was a novelty place and would not go out of our way again. Nice try though. And did I forget to mention the prices are on the high side even for NYC standards lol and they only take cash which is actually cheaper for the restaurant, so makes me question why the price gauging??!!??",10/28/2015,1172,440,879,sPzrs5XTm8qXt4XnBZGeyA

However, this place is VERY expensive for pizza. Even though it has large slices a single regular topping is not worth the $4.00 they say it is.

2210,Megan C.,0,4,"Thank you, Yelp!, for once again helping me discover a wonderful spot to taste a local specialty while traveling! I was wandering around SoHo and Nolita with some friends on a lazy Sunday, and we decided that we needed some NY pizza, especially since one of my companions was a first-time New York visitor. Lombardi's seemed to be the perfect choice simply because it was in Nolita, was convenient to where we were, didn't have a wait, and was extremely well-rated and oft-reviewed.Cash-only!We were seated right away upstairs and had the bubbly Tiffany as our waitress. Service promptness and quality impressed us, especially given this places reputation for long lines and waits.We ordered two pies: a traditional Margherita-style pie and a pie with red sauce, mushroom, and pancetta. As expected, crust was just what you look for when you come to NY for a wood oven, NY-style pizza. Perfection. Tomato sauce tasted very fresh and a little sweeter than most red sauces, probably due to the Marzetti (spelling) brand they tout as their tomato sauce supplier. Truthfully, I've never met a NY-style pizza I haven't liked while actually in one of the NYC boroughs, but what Lombardi's has in addition to the great pizza is a wonderful tradition and story (apparently they're the ""first pizzeria in America""), a fantastic Nolita location, and their 'za is relatively inexpensive.Definitely a most solid choice for first-time NY-style pizza virgins and for established NY pizza aficionados alike.",10/4/2013,529,659,558,2BHVz9wWG2WCJ7neA3cn4w

The sauce, OH THE SAN MARZANO TOMATO SAUCE, with basil and the fresh mozzarella- it's a heavenly, (heavy for the soul) combination. It's definitely one of the best pizza places I've been to, and will come back for more in the near future since it's close to where I work. Plus, our server was really nice and the place has a homey feel to it.",12/21/2013,40,4,3,C_5G1VI0QdYvTwsqHuUpnQ
2212,Melissa P.,0,3,"Lombardi's Pizza is good. But to me, it's just that. Good. Not great. Not fantastic. But good.I know people who do backflips over this place, as well as people who say they'd pass. Also, the wait to get a seat here is usually long enough for your insides to start eating your insides if you show up hungry enough.This is just one of those ""go to say you went"" sort of places.",5/29/2014,106,72,16,Ozi4jzKG5GtVlVFLcqWpdw
2213,Carolyn V.,1,1,"NOT the best in the planet, Zagat or whoever the hell made that bold-as-balls claim.Quality toppings? Check. Cheese way too solidified and not gooey and melty enough? Check.Cold beers? Check.Crust that was soggy as socks worn with Birkenstocks during a typhoon in Southeast Asia? Check. Seriously. Gross. Couldn't even hold the slice up to eat it, had to support it on the bottom with both hands b/c it was so soggy wet. Blech. Yucky? Check.Saw our server three times: once to get our order, once to deliver our order, and once to give us the check (after we flagged him down)? Check.Tourist trap? Check?Highly overrated?

2214,Camille B.,1,3,"Before I even arrived in NY, some friends told me that Lombardi's wasn't the best pizza in the city but since my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to stop by while waiting for our table at Cafe Habana (we wanted to squeeze in as many restaurants on our visit as possible). There was a line at the entrance, and we asked the host if we could order take-out. He directed us to the back of the restaurant, where they had a separate kitchen in which you could place your order. Unfortunately, Lombardi's doesn't sell pizza by the slice, so we said thank you and made our way out. I would definitely give it a try again if we had the time to sit down for dinner, but pizza by the slice is always a good option to provide to customers.",1/15/2012,277,350,1760,opSbHEfHYfCZvfff7vKvYA
2215,Andy R.,1,5,"I went to NY on a 5 day pizza marathon. When I made it to Lombardi's my date and I were nauseated from a psychedelic cab ride and a hellacious hang-over. We sipped a sprite and waited in line outside for 30 minutes. The inside of the place was so loud and crowded that we would have thought we were at a concert- then again we were hung over. The hostess moved us through the sea of kids and families in the narrow room with the oven at the end. How lucky! This room was quieter and had mostly 2 seater tables. We ordered 1 Margherita pizza. 2 glasses of water. Absolutely fantastic! I would say it was The Best Pizza of my life, but 2 days later I ate the best pizza of my life. It was the 2nd best pizza I have ever eaten. The crust was bubbly, black&tan, and  gorgeous. The sauce was simple. Cheese was light and perfect. The Basil was elegant.",6/24/2007,146,285,287,w6UROR83lHGKhp3frbgn2A
2216,Eve M.,0,4,Went to Lombardis for the third time and it was better than I remembered. The sauce definitely makes this pizza taste amazing. Some of the best pizza I've had in a while.,2/25/2016,8,9,1,z2B4PD4OJNfjs7COYxHnNg
2217,Omar M.,0,2,Overrated. I'm guessing this is some NY staple but I wasn't impressed. The pizza crust was burnt and looking at other tables I guess that is their style. I have had much better pizza at many different pizza places in NYC.,3/24/2017,0,26,2,lUfQ4jJtlHJ4mC9MsbI35w

2220,Jose A.,0,4,"Went here for the first time this past Sunday around 2 pm. There was a small line in front of us at the restaurant so took about 15 minutes or so to get seated, which wasn't so bad... the restaurant has ample seating.Ordered a small (14"", six slices) original-style pizza half-pepperoni, half-cheese. Pizza came out fairly quickly (~10 minutes). The pizza was quite tasty (especially the pepperoni pizza) and was up there with some of the best pizza I've ever had. Just the right amount of basil favoring and a thin crust which was also delicious. Probably the best pizza I've had out of the handful of places I've tried in NYC. (Would rate as slightly better than Arturo's and Grimaldi's - both of which I also enjoyed and highly recommend - and definitely better than DiFara's.) Paid $21.50 for the pizza which was expensive, but well worth it.Some things I didn't like:-While the pizza ranks up there with some of the best I've ever had, there was a (very slight) sogginess to the pizza. A couple of the slices broke apart as I lifted them up to eat them. - Like many NYC pizza parlors, Lombardi's doesn't serve slices - only whole pies.- Lombardi's has a bar area, but you can't eat at the bar.But overall an outstanding pizza place. Wait staff was courteous and very speedy. Would highly recommend to anyone and will definitely go back the next time I'm in NYC!",12/8/2013,0,21,0,_vsMB3gQ2j9-1iQ-MlFEAg
2221,Robert L.,0,5,"Very good pizza. But keep in mind, it is pizza, eventually returns will diminish. I am a pizza-lover yet find 90%+ to be inedible. This place is good though and a definitely go-to when visiting Manhattan. I think it is cash-only. People complain about the price but it is a waitered restaurant in NYC; I think it is reasonable but I would not call it cheap and definitely not expensive.",3/22/2016,2,16,0,YktIdFUyxZCzJp3DkC5ahg
2222,Steph S.,0,4,"I probably would've bumped this up to a 5 if I had eaten this right away ... but my boyfriend and I were too full from lunch to eat it so we left it for awhile and it went cold.  Normally, I'm a cold pizza lover ... but this just isn't meant to be eaten with a wait. The pizza is HUGE and the flavors were good enough for me to know that it would've been 10x better if I ate it right away.  So, EAT THIS right away and SHARE.  It's not only HUGE, but it's a hefty price.  Each topping is an extra $2.50 :/",6/19/2013,1115,359,153,Wd43YdZtztC169e2K_7jog

2224,Robert M.,0,4,"I foot raced through the city to meet some co-workers here for a late dinner. I was running way behind and we were all starving. I was giving them a hard time because they both live in NYC but have never been to Lombardi's. Actually, they had never been to any of the restaurants I book marked for my weeks stay in the city. I had to travel all this way to pick restaurants and make reservations for our group. I will not let them hear the end of it.All that said, I absolutely loved my dining experience at Lombardi's as did my did my co-workers. We waited about 5 minutes and were seated in a corner nook near a window for some great passerby watching. Our server was not only delicious on the eyes, but was super speedy and complimentary. Wondered if we had met before, hmmm, must have been the big full beautiful moon or the fact I said, this was my very first time.I was given control rights to order the entire meal. We split a salad, a round of beers and a large Margherita with pancetta and mushrooms.  We tore through that pizza like a pack of wolves. No better way to do it and it gave us the fuel we needed to hit the streets. Although this is cash only, they do have an ATM on site.  No biggie for us. I was with money bags and he picked up the bill.",9/20/2013,184,214,11,jwfOpCgeob0itikBIfPi2Q
2225,Maki S.,0,5,"Went there for the first time over July 4th holiday weekend for dinner, the wait was about 25 minutes like they told us, we were sitting on a bench outside the restaurant so it wasn't bad.   Our table is in the back room which is more like a long hallway and we were freezing, the AC unit was near our table.We came here for one thing - clam pie, so that's what we ordered plus 2 iced tea, the pie has 6 slices, plenty for the 2 of us, we waited for about 10, 15 minutes, the waitress came back and told us the clam pie has sold out.  What happened was a few clam pie orders went to the kitchen at the same time and ours was the last one (darn it!) and they ran out of clams.   I was disappointed, the waitress took off the drinks from our check because we waited for so long.  We went ahead and ordered a small Margherita pie with 3 toppings - pancetta, meatballs and olives.  So more waiting....the waitress came back once again, this time saying a table has 2 slices of calm pie left and want us to have them for free because they've ""heard"" our clam pie story!  I was like ""Are you serious?!"".  I went to thank the nice lady at the other table.   When we got the 2 slices, they were already cold but the aroma from the clam was still fresh, the crust was really thin, super crispy, it was SO GOOD!  Worth every bite!   We chowed them down in seconds then our regular pie came...it was good but had a bit too much sauce so the crust was soggy, the olives were super salty, meatballs were fantastic and pancetta was good as well.   Our nice waitress deserves 5 stars and if I could give her 10 stars, I would!Clam pie:  5 stars, even when it's cold, will definitely go back for a whole pie and more! Margherita pie: 3 and a half stars.  Will give it another try with less toppings, no olives for sure.",7/11/2013,3,100,332,mi-2YfIj88R2VlDy0DAvxg

I think I had high expectations for Lombardi's, because I was slightly disappointed. I came here on a rainy weeknight and we ordered the caesar salad and a large pepperoni, sausage, garlic spinach, pizza for 3 people. Lombardi's still had enough customers, considering that it was pouring rain.The pizza took a while to come out, and I'm not sure if I would've waited any longer. Props for having a crispy thin crust and coal oven taste, but other than that I was not impressed. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff was accommodating, a great place for a group. Pictures of celebrities who have visited this historic pizzeria, newspaper articles, and awards serve as the wall decor around the restaurant. Something fun to look at while you're waiting for your pizza. At least I can say I've been to the first pizzeria in the U.S!",8/27/2013,29,75,1,p648b3cV_CJI5duOcaMOfg

My vanilla cream soda was bland, but i sucked it up (haha punny!). We tried the bruschetta which was excellent, shared a caeser salad that was superb, and the literally mouth watering pepperoni pizza.We werent checked up on very often but that was okay because we were too busy enjoying the food.

The sauce is absolutely fantastic, the crust is great, and the cheese and toppings are on point. It's in the 99th percentile of the pizza university world; it's Ivy League quality. But it's Cornell, and Cornell is not Harvard. From what I've seen, Joe's is at least Columbia, maybe even Harvard.Would I send my kid to Cornell? Of course.

Fortunately, we only waited to be seated in about 20 minutes. It feels like a traditional east-coast italian joint, with brick walls, red-checked table cloths, wine and sangria served in carafes, and black and white framed photos on the walls.They are famous for their pizza, and one bite later, you will see why. Delicious chewy crust, slightly thicker version of NY style, but not overly so. Cheesy, but not in excess. Well seasoned tomato sauce. Great balance of ingredients.

2241,Julie K.,0,4,"I knew Lombardi's was going to be a tourist trap, and quite possibly over-hyped, but overall it did not disappoint. The decor is very kitsch Italian, with checkerboard tablecloths and a Mona Lisa mural outside. It's not super upscale, and they do not do reservations for small groups. However, there was no line when we went (8pm on a weekday). Now, Lombardi's is known as ""the best pizza in NYC"" and also the first. I expected a greasy New York slice, but this wasn't the case (I like those greasy slice pizzas btw). Between 5 people, we got two large pizzas - one meat heavy and one more veggie heavy. Also, we opted for a fairly well priced pitcher of Sangria(it was good). The pizzas had great flavor and I especially liked the sausage topping. The problem with Lombardi's though was that the crust was TOO crispy. It was to the point where your jaw gets tired if you eat more than two slices. The flavor was spot on but the texture...not my favorite. In the end, I would say this was a solid place for a pizza, but not blow-me-out-of-this-world amazing. I quite enjoyed it, but I think once in my lifetime is enough for this place.",10/21/2013,260,438,102,Wez_YoTdzSxsBWPvx-leaA
2242,Cream Cheese C.,0,4,"Yes, it's a tourist trap and yes you should be eating something more interesting than pizza when in this neighborhood. But. Lombardi's pizza really is that good: uber thin crust, pop-in-your-mouth fresh tomato sauce, and generous high quality toppings. Friendly waitstaff deserve an award for maintaining composure in the midst of throngs of tourists.

We ordered the Margarita pizza with meatball and pepperonis. Crust, was perfection. Sauce was tasty and not over powering. Cheese was sliced and creamy.

It was still good, but since I actually compared it to the others, it gets a 3.

2257,Gwu3 ..,0,1,"The last time my friend and I came to Lombardi's about a year or two years ago, the food was great but this time the experience was pretty fucking terrible. I walked inside with my friend and I see the host talking to another coworker, I waited for a few moments because I understand that sometimes employees are busy doing something at the moment before they can help customers. But I see this host continue to chitchat with his coworker, he makes eye contact with me multiple times and just keeps talking, I had to interrupt him in order for him to actually pay attention to us, I just thought that was pretty rude. We asked for a table for two and we didn't wait long, our table was downstairs in this wine cellar that was basically a makeshift room to fit more customers. It was a small room that had a restroom which was kind of distracting because other diners would constantly come downstairs to use the restroom and by the end of the night we felt claustrophobic because it just felt like there was no air down there. We sat down and our server takes the order of the table next to us who sat down after we did. The service was meh, it felt like there was no service and I don't want to be constantly looking around for my server or anyone else to ask for tissue (they give you like one tissue and there isn't like a box on the table where you can grab more you have to ask for them like wtf) or anything else. We finally ordered and got our water which came with cheap mini clear plastic cups and paper plates with metal utensils. I just don't understand how Lombardi's which has the reputation as the first pizzeria in the United States and is obviously a successful establishment can not have regular silverware and dinnerware, only paid drinks like wine and beer came in actual glasses, it just felt like they're being cheap and lazy. We're not at a local pizzeria or a two bros, it is Lombardi's and I expected much more. We ordered the bruschetta and a small Margherita with pancetta and mushrooms which was nice and fresh but honestly I would not come back because the food is not good enough and is pretty expensive to justify everything else.",8/4/2016,0,4,0,uzdtXdcJ2L3k59OP_8i8gg

2260,Christian L.,0,5,Great place. Very Old fashioned with checkered tables and bar. The pizza is made in the original style so don't expect it to be like American pizza where it's all covered in cheese. They have many great toppings to choose from and every pie is made fresh everyday. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients whether it's the cheese and crust or the Basil and tomato sauce. Try to avoid going during lunch hours as its always full and the average waiting time is 30-45 minutes especially on holidays. CASH ONLY!!!,3/11/2016,0,2,2,bb-KpxJrra2FZCrYGa6lyA

The wait for this place is crazy if you come at prime dinner time! Because we were a smaller party, we were able to get seated in 10 minutes. Again, like rest of other restaurants, it was cramped but bigger in space.The small pizza is $17.99. Large is about $23.99. And you add Regular toppings for $3.00 each and Premium topping for $4.00... Talk about being cheap in NYC... I don't know what you can eat lol!We got 2 regular toppings and 1 premium topping.

2268,Travis W.,0,4,"At Lombardi you can taste the history in the pizza. One of the main reasons is because of their coal ovens that have been grandfathered in which would otherwise be illegal to use nowadays. Do not come expecting those dreaded Chicago style deep dish concoctions. The pizzas here are thin, crisp, and oh so delicious. Toppings are not necessary as their plain pizza can hold it's own just fine, but toppings do not hurt either. Their meatball topping is delicious and I am always a fan of pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions on my slices. Their house wines are pretty standard, but they do come in extremely small glasses. I've had the sangria here as well, and it was too sweet for my taste. The establishment is cash only and although pricier than your usual pizzerias, the pies you get here are worth the extra dollars.",12/27/2013,172,22,10,LTFD-9gCK7vKCQ4jpPPnaw

They could use a little more garlic and some crushed red pepper.  The bread sticks were also on the bland side.  The red sauce served with each was delicious though.  We then ordered a clam pizza and a pepperoni mushroom and olive pizza.  The clam pizza was a bit of a let down.  It is prepared without sauce and was too dry for my liking.  If I ordered it again I'd add  sauce (white sauce if Lombardi's has it).  Bacon would also be a good addition.  The other pizza was decent, but overall I think Lombardi's is a little over hyped.  Solid pizza?

2281,Daniel R.,1,4,"**THE BAD**My experience with the host staff was tumultuous. The place was busy, as I suspect it often is, and we were given a 15-20 minute wait. After 3-4 minutes, my friend decided to use the restroom. A minute later, our party was called. I went into the restaurant so we didn't lose our place, and suddenly felt like I was being thrown through a meat grinder.""Yes, I'm here for my part--""""Is your whole party here sir?""""Well yes but my friend is in the ba--""""This way please, and you as well!"" He pointed to a couple behind.Now I'm trying to explain my situation to this guy, but he is not giving me the time of day as we twist and turn through the restaurant--even through the kitchen itself--to my group's table in the back of the place.My head is spinning, I'm supposed to have two other people with me but don't, I have no idea how to get to my table, and I'm afraid if I get up to look for my friend we're going to lose our table.Needless to say it took about 10-15 minutes of phone tag for my friends to finally find me in the back , and I sat alone for about the same amount of time before our waiter greeted us.**THE GOOD**When the waiter DID finally come, he was extremely apologetic for the host staff's behavior. I was ready to order for our whole party when the waiter stopped me.  He said ""they treat people like it's the army up [at the host stand.] There's no rush, so take as long as you need to find what you really want.""After that, the experience improved. My friends arrived, we ordered, and everything was peachy. The waiter was attentive, and a young man came by 3-4 times to refill my water.Now, about the pizza itself: I am originally from Long Island, having left as a child. In all of my travels since, I have enjoyed the pining of New Yorkers for good pizza. While some exiled New Yorkers might find a place they think is pretty good, all will agree that no ""New York style""  is  as good as genuine New York pizza. It's a hopeless quest, really. The common reasoning is that ""the water is different."" Whatever that means.Lombardi's pizza was delicious. It wasn't greasy like a lot of pizza, nor was it flavorless. There was an excellent balance between cheese, sauce, toppings and crust. The pizza was tasty but also palatable, which is tough to find. I really liked the crust. You could taste the fire from the oven but also a hint of salt.Describing the food doesn't really do it justice. I would absolutely recommend trying it.**PRICING**16-17 bucks for a small pizza, 20-21 for a large. Three bucks for each topping, 2 for a topping on half the pizza. I thought this was pricey but it's New York, it's a touristy place to eat and it's great pizza.I felt it was actually worth the cost, which is not something you can always say.**OVERALL**The host staff made me feel how a cow must feel getting pushed around at a cattle ranch. Totally impersonal and a huge turn off.Our waiter was attentive, polite and apologetic for the procedures of the host staff. At the end of the meal, I said ""that guy's a champ.""The pizza was pricey but delicious.I would absolutely recommend Lombardi's with the caution that it is a busy restaurant and you should make sure your whole party is together before you are seated.-D",6/27/2011,150,202,47,xSTSdqDcc0xqpOXIwEd0fA

2292,DineoutGal A.,0,4,"We just wanted a slice of pizza to tie us over till dinner but no such luck as most of these famed NYC pizza joints do not sell by the slice. There was a massive crowd milling about outside waiting for their chance to eat this coal fired pizzas. We opted to do takeout which involves making your way through the hungry line of people waiting for a table where you have to go to the kitchen in the back. We opted for the calzone for $13 and could add any two items along with the ricotta cheese. We ordered the sautéed garlic spinach and meatballs. The wait is awkward because you don't want to remain in the kitchen where all the staff are frantically working. Nor do you want to stand outside of the kitchen in the narrow hallway as you're pretty much staring at diners and also being in the way of servers. But you don't want to be so far away that you don't hear your order being called! This is take out limbo if there ever was one. Anyways, our calzone was done in about 20 mins and we took the massive thing to the park next door. It was a nice day and obviously other Lombardi customers were there since the trash cans were overflowing with Lombardi pizza boxes. I'm sure the kiddies who play in that playground must love all the tourists who treat this play area as their dining room. Other than the annoying pigeons, it was nice to dine outside on a warm sunny day.The calzone did not disappoint even though I wanted the pizza. The calzone's  dough, which I imagine to be the same as the pizza dough is the right flavour and consistency without taking away from the other ingredients. The marinara dipping sauce tasted very simple but very delicious as it made the calzone even more yummy. The marinara is made with San Marzano tomatoes, which makes for a very balanced sauce. The meatballs and the spinach were both well seasoned and made for a very substantial late lunch for two. I'd love to go back and try their pizza!CASH ONLY!On a very side note...the washroom near the kitchen is super awkward. The wall in front of the toilet gives you no room to sit properly.

I only deduct a star because although the food it most important, convenience and overall experience also factors in.  It's not the easiest trip from Queens, and a long subway ride home with a food coma isn't fun.  It can be a touch hectic inside too.  Any way Lombardi's could make a NYC-only section, and have everyone else (upstate, LI, other states and countries) sit in a different area? ;)",7/17/2013,36,78,0,E1g7kZak9Gsuwp9Oa26EvQ

2305,Sherry T.,1,2,"Considering the excessively long wait for lunch, I expected out-of-this world pizza. The crust tasted like charcoal, the sauce was watered down and completely bland, and the cheese was nothing special. This was a huge disappointment for my New York style pizza debut.

2307,Ann L.,0,2,I used to LOVE coming to Lombardi's until this past Saturday.  The pizza tasted bland!  The sauce needs more flavor.  They were skimpy with toppings that are now $5 extra for each item. The prices increased and the flavor decreased.  Sorry Lombardi's you have lost your touch.,1/20/2016,0,38,6,yvqrYxlnV323IFiDrh_z0w
2308,Coco C.,0,2,"Before the last expansion about 10 years ago Lombardi's used to be the BEST and most authentic pizza! Now they use cheaper ingredients and simply ride the coat tales of the legacy. Its really sad, I used to go to Lombardi's once a week, and now it has become a sub-par tourist trap. The pizza dough is so soggy and yeasty now, and the cheese is so cheap it tastes like dominos and the sauce just isn't the same. They are banging out so many pies, I guarantee they are not using the original oven for every pie. Then that means you are going there and your food is a crap shoot, you could be getting anything. You are still paying high quality prices at second rate quality and service. I rather travel to Queens or Brooklyn for a old school slice for $10 a pie.New Yorkers beware.

2310,Rachel S.,0,4,"We couldn't wait 2 hours in line for this pizza, so we ordered take out and literally at it outside of the restaurant by the curb. Decent waiting time for it to come out, but not excessive. Plus, all is forgiven when the pizza tastes that good!We got it with just plain cheese, and it was amazing!! The crust was thin and crisp with a little bit of chew, and everything was still piping hot. I still dont know if i would wait in line for 2 hours, but I'd certainly get take out again!P.s. If you're bringing other people here as a stop for a touristy visit, be sure to visit Rice to Riches right after for dessert. It's dozens of different flavors of rice pudding with different toppings, it's a PERFECT end to dinner, and its just a block away!",9/5/2013,36,157,93,_4CdrjdNhxjj4SDtx0SZdA

Pizza in NY got to have it! Lombardi's did not disappoint .. A lot of tomato sauce very crispy is not flimsy hot from the oven oh man! And service was quick!

2313,Hyanna C.,0,5,I didn't want Lombardi's to be my favorite pizza because of the hype. But there is a reason this place has been acclaimed for so long.I believe the mozzarella was about equal with Grimaldi's but I found the crust at Lombardi's to be better. The best part about this place is the sauce. It has that tomato tang goin' on and I LOVE IT.Definitely go margherita and be prepared to wait. If you're smart you'll hit the ATM beforehand (there aren't any BofAs very near) and go at an awkward time.,9/23/2013,12,46,6,kxuYY6iPwbiaYfgLaCex6A
2314,Jane S.,0,4,"The pizza is different than in other places; the dough/crust is made like it was made in the old days. Plus, it's supposed to be the oldest pizzeria in America.

2317,Alice L.,0,3,"This was one of the first meals we had in NY, and surprisingly, there wasn't a wait when we went. We decided to get the white pizza with sausage and spinach on top. The pizza itself was a bit pricey, but my gosh, adding the toppings made it ridiculously expensive! Nevertheless, I was excited to try THE Lombardi's! The pizza looked really nice with the cheese sorta piped onto the pizza rather than sprinkled. The pizza was very good with the first couple of bites, but then the cheese got so overwhelming since there's so much! And I LOVE cheese too. My boyfriend and I had to scrape off the cheese midway through the pizza. It was a still a good and very unique take on a white pizza, but this place will probably be one of those restaurants I'm glad I experienced but probably won't care too much to visit again.",6/9/2015,519,338,27,sd8Z7wHmsXG657cZf6S9zg

But with that, the ingredients taste fresh and I liked the fact that there wasn't rivers of oil dripping off my pizza.  Two friends and I got a small (14"") margherita pizza with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers.  Yummy- they didn't bog down the pizza with the toppings, but you got a good mix in each bite.  A small for three of us was plenty enough, and it leaves room for dessert. :)Service is friendly- again, tourists, so everyone is smiling.",5/20/2013,320,363,167,ytQqW4xFMAYu7i8bAR1zzA

2321,Emmy M.,0,5,"There are already thousands of reviews for this place on here, so I won't clutter up the wall too much:RICOTTA.You simply must get the ricotta as one of your toppings.It is unlike any other ricotta I've ever eaten (anywhere-- let alone on a pizza). At Lombardi's, it takes the form of impossibly soft and rich little pillows of delicate cheesy heaven that, when slightly melted into the tomato sauce, are simply divine.",1/20/2012,17,182,208,wk-a8ISC1lDblQ0Y-U8o_Q
2322,Natalie K.,1,2,"I  was excited to go there since it's, ""the first pizzeria in America"" but do NOT see myself coming back. I agree with the reviews describing Lombardi's Pizza as overpriced. The bread sticks are just that, bread sticks! There is no Parmesan on top, no butter, just a bowl of marinara on the side and they're $8.95! SO not worth it! The basket of bread should be free! The Pizza is alright, the cheese is not fully spread over the pizza, it's more of slices of mozzarella placed sparsely around so if you are still convinced you want to experience the pizza, make sure you get extra cheese.As far as the establishment itself, the staff is rude. Very dry and unaccommodating.  My boyfriend has some color to his skin and found the waiters being racist. The waiter would not look at him when at our table and only made eye contact with me. When he was bringing the check ( I was in the bathroom ), he put the check on my side of the table and did not hand it to my boyfriend. There was no good bye, no thank you for coming when we were leaving. I thanked the host when exiting and he just ignored me. So if you are anything besides white, I would not suggest coming here if you are expecting good service.",5/14/2013,423,315,1860,uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg

Long line by 6:30pm, but luckily for us, they had a table for 5 right away so we got to skip the line. Amazing service (way better than Grimaldi's).

That's all I have to say, SO FRESH!!! The sauce was unlike anything I've ever tried. Fresh, not too runny, very tomato-y, perfect. With the basil's freshness, one could not ask for more!!! We got pepperoni and sausage on our pizza. So yummy, especially the sausage. My fiance really liked the cheese too, not too chewy or gooey, but perfectly melted on the crispy crust!The last night in NY we came here again!! And our waiter remembered us too!!!

I had the Famous clam pie that cost as 30$ (6 slices). It was pretty tasty, thin crust pizza, and there's a clam on it (lol). I just find it mediocre, maybe if I tried the margherita pizza that I saw on the other table; I think I would have a better experience as it seems to be bigger and looks more appetizing.I have to remind you that this restaurant has no dessert and mode of payment should be in cash only",7/1/2014,30,8,3,CFALXVgksIreJlVFqt6BkQ

The crust is ultra thin, crispy and charred on the bottom ( charred and bubbly on top). The coal oven is essential in making the pizza a master piece. Don't overdo it with the toppings and your pizza will come out crispy and chewy. Too many add ons will leave your pizza soggy and salty. I usually just go with the sauce, mozzarella and basil( their base pizza). I always go here when we come back to NY.

Their thin crust is actually a lot thicker than I had anticipated.. (if you want REAL thin crust, go to luzzo's!). They say that put some pecorino in their original pie, but all i saw of that were about two small, dot-sized shavings. Nothing about this pie particularly stood out to me. I mean, it's not a bad pizza... it's just very.. standard tasting. Nothing special, and way way WAY too overhyped.",1/21/2012,822,279,1444,h5UrFxN1bejk5oiRL3LWsw

They were recommended to me by a co-worker several years ago and it was one of the greatest suggestions I've ever gotten. The pizza melts in your mouth. The crust and bread of the pizza is that perfect level of doughy, buttery & just crispy enough to get a light crunch when you bite in. The mozzarella is always fresh & melted to perfection.

But I've had more than Pizza Hut, and Lombardi's was good but not 5-star worthy.One thing I will give it credit to is the consistency of the crust. At other thin crust pizza places I've been to, the crust tends to get thicker in some spots--especially the edges--and thinner around some. Lombardi's pizza crust was quite even.I really liked the pepperoni topping; it was sliced very thin, and it curled up into little crispy bits that reminded me of bacon strips. The sausage, however, was not my favorite; I had really excellent and fresh-tasting meat sausage at John's and this one was a little sub-par.Otherwise, service was speedy, and my party of two was seated right away at 6 on a Monday night.Also: pizzas are pretty cheap dinners.",6/6/2011,36,1123,346,9G8EyOAEv5mfSOdsbrIF7A
2346,Melanie T.,0,3,"Although Lombardi's is rated pretty high on the pizza restaurant scene in NYC, it does not make it on my top ten - granted I prefer the Neapolitan style over everything else (I do NOT even consider ""deep dish"" to be pizza... don't get me started). In the world of NY Style I would say that it would come up on my top five for their nice crispy crust and a really delicious sauce. Go if you live here and want to cross it off of your list - if you have limited time in the city, and are not on a Pizza Tour head a little north-west to Keste, for true Neapolitan style.  If you prefer NY over Neapolitan head a little north-west again for Bleecker street pizza which is my favorite.

2353,Steve R.,0,2,We had the  plain and  cake boss pizza and three drinks for $75 plus tip. Service was good but pizza crust was hard and tough. Not thin and crisp. Very disappointing. Lots of better choices available.  I would not go back.,7/12/2016,0,2,0,CuN52C09r9Eq23TMZ6QOwA
2354,Tracy S.,0,3,"The pizza is fine.  It is a very good example of NY style pizza.  So, 4 stars for the pizza.  The rest of the place leaves a lot to be desired.Like some of the other reviewers, I found the service rude and impersonal.  When I come here it is only because I have out of state family or friends in town and they've heard of it and want to go.  You would think that maybe the staff would try to crack a tiny smile - even a rude joke - some sort of personality to appeal to their obviously tourist-dominated crowd, but they don't.  You're lucky if they'll make eye contact with you as they scribble down your order.  And even though you may wait for a good 30-45 minutes for a table, and another 30 for your food to come out, don't be surprised if you see them slap the bill down just a few minutes after your pizza arrives.",12/31/2013,46,163,3,ehR5ieUf_2M4V51rroT5ag

Anyway the white pizza was better than expected. but the service was so slow that even took 10 mins wait for someone came to order and not even called a service cz she only showed up twice throughout the dinner.",6/7/2014,11,2,5,3Usd7g7ycdP2g_Zm4XNIEw

2359,Christopher B.,0,4,"Meatballs $10.95House Salad $9Large Margherita Pizza $22.50My wife and I came here after walking around Herald Square. We took the Subway (N or Q) train to Canal Street to Chinatown and walked over to Little Italy to find Lombardi's. I've seen this place on the travel channel and since it was our last day in NYC, we had to try America's oldest pizzeria. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the ambience. The walls are decorated with pics of its 100 plus year history and the space is just enough to squeeze in to. We passed by the owner who talking to someone right as we were being led to our table. The food was pretty good. The meatballs were quite tender and seasoned well. The pizza was HUGE! It could easily feed 4 people. It was pretty saucy and chewy. One thing though is that I wish the crust were a little bit more crispy. The prices are a little on the high side too. Overall, I would come back here again. Lombardi's is worth going to for its history, good customer service, and huge portions.",1/27/2016,79,117,0,xlynctesxBjMACgpoYqEmg

2361,Tim G.,1,4,"I was searching for good pizza in NYC and found it! We came here as a party of 3 for lunch right around 11:30am on a Sunday. There was already a line even before the restaurant opened up. Your entire party needs to be present or else they won't seat you. Make sure you get everyone there or else you'll end up waiting... The place filled up pretty quickly and it looks small on the outside but once you go in you'll notice there is additional seating inside. We didn't have to wait and were seated in a large booth by the window in the back of the restaurant which had a good view of the street.We ordered two pizzas because we were hungry. One large with homemade meatballs, sausage and pepperoni and a small with mushrooms, tomatoes and onions. The meatballs were really large and meaty. The toppings are really expensive but they do give you a lot though. I really do like the pizza because it's cooked just right and the  mozzarella is very stringy and cooked to perfection. The fresh basil also adds flavor to the taste of the pizza. Two pizzas for three people was a little too much but we still did manage to finish it all up. Their pizza is not greasy at all and the ingredients are fresh. I assure you the pizza is as good as everyone else has praised it to be. Service was good here and we left very satisfied and full for the rest of the afternoon.Will I be back? Absolutely, when I'm NYC again!",4/30/2011,483,500,266,MVQCzaDxDr0JFefXrE38qw

Excellent atmosphere, good service and interestingly, we got to walk through the white-walled kitchen on the way to our table. My husband and I ordered two large margheritas between us, and we killed 'em both. No doggie bags. For toppings, we ordered pancetta and sausage on one pizza, which was wonderful, because the sausage was sliced paper-thin to suit the thin crust pizza. Anchovies, roasted red peppers and mushrooms on the other - terrific, but might have made it a wee bit too much for the delicate crust: I'd recommend choosing no more than two toppings. Of course, you can fold the pizza slice to trap everything, which is the whole idea! They carry local Brooklyn beer, and five different house reds by the glass: I enjoyed a merlot.",5/16/2013,7,32,8,V95F7B6p52-Qyuz4hkxc7A
2366,Tae K.,1,3,"In terms of restaurant pizza, it is quite appetizing, but as a NY style pizza, it just didn't have that particular NY slice that I have come to love and crave.  As my wife put it, it is more like a regular thin crust brick oven pizza that you could get anywhere.",11/3/2013,180,960,27,hR8LdFd3hskR0eZbuMT31Q

Not at all ! The crust had no flavor.. and no great Italian taste.. and the price was Crazy for 2 medium pies ... 3 sodas and a glass of wine .. and hey no free refills what gives..

Though, their pie doesn't tear me from my undying loyalty to Chicago Style deep dish pizza. Nothing beats that.

I have nothing against NYC pizza, I just wanted to see what the fuss was about given this was open in 1905, making it the first pizzeria in America.I had a small pizza, 14 in, bacon and onion. the bacon was fairly bland and I was forced to load a lot of crushed pepper to get some salt/spice flavoring. the tomato sauce was somewhat runny, indicating that the timing or temperature of the cook was imperfect. the crust was average too. the benefit is that the pizza doesn't have anything that wrong with it, it doesn't sit heavy in your stomach, no serious problems, allowing you to eat many slices before you get full. however I think this place is average at best (30$ Paid including tax and tip for 2 ppl).",1/12/2014,332,485,184,WIFb-G9x9Z7uTF7hi-qQJw
2373,Carolina D.,0,2,"Honestly, for this being the first pizzeria in the country... it's just meh. The white pizza was bland. Now, this comes with saying that I am not much of a condiment lover, and still, it was as flavorless as eating milk foam. I had to load it with salt and some crushed peppers to taste anything. The margherita was much better, the sauce was good, the crust was thin and crispy enough. I did like that one, however, for the rep of being the oldest pizzeria around, not much to write home about.

Fast enough, the three of us were seated downstairs after waiting only a bit. We had breadsticks... they tasted like plain dough, and even with the dipping sauce, they were hard and dry. I was not impressed.The peach iced tea was good, though, not too sweet.The pepperoni and mushroom pizza was okay - the base toppings were of very good quality (fresh mozz, and a good tomato sauce), but the pepperoni needed to be a bit more spicy or salty, and the mushrooms were okay. The crust was the same as the breadsticks... none too appetizing after the breadsticks, really. And the crust under the toppings was thin, but not crisp, just soggy, like Chi N. noted.A mozz + mozz pizza should be pretty good here, I think.Pretty touristy. Overall not a bad place to try out, but I think I still like Patsy's better.At least parking's free outside after 6p or 7p on the street.",1/6/2011,1747,2860,1391,nnwBdqGHIAJQ5QX9lHOtrQ

My boyfriend & I had to try this place to see what all the hype was about; and we saw why!The menu is simple; just basically pizzas and house salads. The only reason pizza here is such a kick from any other place is the way they bake their thin crust pizza & their delicious toppings! Toppings you will never find anywhere else. That day, we decided on a small pizza, (was huge! comes in large also) homemade meatballs, sauteed garlic spinach, fresh mushrooms and my favorite-- the sweet Italian sausage! Omgsh. Pizza on a whole 'nother level. Loved it! Negative things about this place was the wait. It was crazy! Dining for two, our wait was a good 35 minutes. It was all worth it in the end though. Also, Lombardi's only accepts cash. That was a bummer--but there was an ATM machine on the first floor of the restaurant. :)  Lombardi's definitely lives up to their title and shows why the wait for seating was so long.

Wife and I got a large pizza with 2 drinks, the total was like $60. And they don't accept credit cards, you have to pay cash. It is overpriced and I am sure it attracts lots of tourists because of their good reviews on Yelp and PR.

Gave us a little surprise to share :) All of a sudden, a tall glass with whipped cream, 3 cherries, and 3 straws descends onto the table before my eyes-- how pleasant is that! Sure made the wait for the pizza feel a little shorter.The neighborhood in which this business is located is quaint too. Lots of little boutiques, love those!Food was fresh, all the staff members for good, and we had a great time here.I must say, the pizza felt like a bit of a wait to arrive, but I did go there starving... lol.

I don't claim to know anything about NY pizza, but I can tell you what I thought of Lombardi's. And I...LOVED it. Seriously this is a great little pizza spot in Little Italy, one of the most famous locations in Manhattan. The pizza is just unbelievable. The cheese, sauce and crust are all spectacular. It's just the perfect combination of crunchy, sweet, salty, meaty, cheesy, and warmth.  Be ready to spend about 45 minutes to over an hour waiting for a table. It's cash only so make sure you carry at least $60 for a dinner for two w/ drinks. The setting is historical and perfect for a simple, NY pizza dinner, even romantic in a way. I have nothing but great memories going here, and I guarantee you'll have a similar experience. It's cheap, quick, quality, and the service is fantastic. Organized chaos, but it works.

2390,Lily A.,0,5,"Most of the times I've visited NY I've been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn for pizza and finally decided to try Lombardi's as a comparison. And I love them both just as equally. Lombardi's dough was a tad thicker which definitely holds all the toppings you lay on it (at Grimaldi's sometime I had to fork and knife it). And I loved the extra mozzarella at Lombardi's, whereas at Grimaldi's I loved the extra ricotta. And definitely add the sausage if you're at either venue. Here's a full list of topping availabilityfirstpizza.com/images/Lo…A small pizza here (14"", 6 slices) is perfect for 2 hungry people--you leave very satisfied but not to stuffed so that you can go for drinks right after.

2391,Antoine P.,0,4,"I gave Lombardi's a try because I would always see a line outside this establishment whenever I'm in the Soho/Little Italy/Chinatown area. After doing a little research, I realized that Lombardi's is a New York City icon and establishment that claims to be the first pizzeria in America. Thereupon, I decided to give this joint a try. The first time I ate here, there was a line and we probably waited for 15 minutes. The place was packed but they seem to have several rooms and hidden spaces within the restaurant to fit the constant demand. It a typical pizzeria ambiance with red checkered table cloths on the table. Exposed brick and pictures of the owner and celebs was the decor in some walls of the restaurant. Generally, the ambiance was decent and nothing to fuss about. I was looking forward to trying the food.The service was average at best as each server had a lot on their plates considering the restaurant was packed the entire time. We ordered their Original Pizza made with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce topped with romano and basil. We added fresh mushrooms for toppings. We also decided to try their white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta, romano cheese, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic and infused oil. What can I say? I love both pizzas and wouldn't change a thing! They are both thin crust pizzas and its ingredients were so fresh. Its price is definitely higher than your typical Pappa Johns but hey, it tasted home cooked and gourmet!

2397,Sean C.,0,4,"Lombardi's is one of those tourist hotspots that cannot rightly be called a trap.Yes, it does take itself a bit too seriously as the oldest pizzeria in New York with over a century of experience and history.Yes, it is overpriced for $20+ for a pizza with a couple of toppings and no preset discounted varieties.Yes, despite a huge amount of dining space spread out across multiple rooms at anything resembling a mealtime the wait will be out the door (as there's very little room to hang out inside.)Yes, it is cash only despite revenues and reputation that make refusal to accept credit absurd.Yes, the menu is quite limited outside of pizza.But... yes, Lombardi's has honed its pizza to an art with a coal-fired medium thickness smoky crust, excellent toppings (wild mushrooms!) and a balance that doesn't require on an overabundance of oil and grease for taste.Is it the best pizza in the Tri-State Area? ... Maybe. It would be mistake not to visit at least once to draw one's own conclusion.",1/7/2013,160,383,1,m_ZofG4UObEMBND2vdyiwg

2399,Phung L.,1,5,"Supposedly one of the first pizzeria to open in the states or so they claim. All I know is that this is probably the best pizza I've had ever! Fresh ingredients and a crispy thin crust nothing taste processed.

2400,Scotty F.,0,2,"Dissapointed. Ate here for the first time 8 years ago and it was absolutely amazing. But now the taste of the sauce is bland, the pizza crust had a taste of being burnt.

2401,James K.,0,5,"Now being from California and not having experienced a lot of pizza from NY, you're probably wondering, what do I have this to compare to, to give a 5 star review?Well, i'm from the bay area and I am no stranger to good pizza. There are tons of good pizza establishments in SF so I know good pizza and this one makes the list.I know it's a tourist destination but I hate it when people almost talk down upon ""touristy"" locations. I mean i'm not from NY and am visiting and am a tourist so of course i'd go to at least a few ""toursity"" locations. Why wouldn't I?Anyways, my honey and I split a a 14 inch pie with pepporoni, mushrooms and olives. The crust was crispy, ingredients were very fresh and I loved the touch of I believe it was basil on top. Service was efficient. I skimmed through a recent review (didn't get his name) about how he felt rushed. I will say this. I'd rather be at a very efficient place that knows what they're doing than sit around waiting 10 min to get a refill on water. That's just me though. I'd rather have a waiter not smile but bring my food out quick and refill my drink than have a jolly ass waiter mess up my order and spend more time socializing with his/her coworkers than concentrate on the task at hand.Overall, I enjoyed our experience there. The side salad was pretty damn big too so just know to bring your appetite!",5/13/2011,42,568,7,baD0m5hJdUYEqmJaV3uMdQ

2404,Kristin U.,0,2,"Pretty disappointed!  Not terrible, but if we're going with ""I've experienced better,"" than I definitely have.The waiter barely spoke to us or made eye contact with us, and the pizza definitely looked/tasted like it had been sitting out.  It was barely warm (the table next to ours got a piping hot pizza, with cheese that got all stringy when they picked the pieces off the tray).  The flavors were great, don't get me wrong - nice, sweet San Marzano tomato sauce - but the crust was basically naked.  Super thin layer of sauce and sporadic little blobs of mozzarella.  It was like I had ordered diet pizza an hour before I arrived.If you get a fresh pie, I'm sure it's much better, and double bonus if you get more cheese and sauce.  There's just so much great pizza closer by to me, that I can't see myself making the effort to go back to Lombardi's, unless I'm already in the neighborhood.",5/30/2013,277,229,11,PZYvnNQqE4fXemg63XK76w

Who cares that new yorkers say that it's a tourist place so long as it's good? We always make our own, so I never really have a regular, but I can confidently say I've never been disappointed. Their ingredients are fresh, generous in size, and it's indulgent but not greasy or heavy. Definitely expect a wait  though! We went between 3:30-4 in the afternoon and still had to wait 20-30 minutes. Always going to be on my list of places to hit when in the Big Apple.",4/14/2011,79,585,1149,8fKU-TNTEy9c7orkCuu0Cw

As expected tons of different toppings available to create whatever you want - although it does start to add up as you keep adding.  Beers are reasonable (~5-6 dollars for  draft, pitchers a little less).Worth doing for the experience and great pizza - definitely a NYC tradition.The 1/2 star off is honestly just for the crazy crowd / wait - quality is superb and wait staff are great, just expect hour + wait.P.S. - Don't pull a Trump and mention Famiglia pizza in here, lest you get a thousand lashings!",4/24/2013,105,174,10,mlmDx6pIH8-MkHzY6PV-_w

Be prepared....There will be a wait, there will be crowds.... We started with the antipasto which was perfect to share. Then on to a crazy combination of pizza and toppings I can't even recall. It was all a blur! I do remember my favorite being the ricotta and meatball pizza which we ordered based on our waiter's recommendation. In my opinion, it's hard to mess up a combination of bread, cheese and tomatoes. But some people say this is the best pizza in the world... It was good, and we were full for hours to come. Best?

2408,Nancy L.,0,5,"I've died and gone to pizza heaven. If heaven were as great as they say and I have to work hard to be a ""good"" person to be admitted, then I should be rewarded with Lombardi's New York style pizza. Because once I enter heaven, I will be laying back on a puffy cloud, feet up, mouth wide open with a huge slice of Lombardi's margherita pizza topped with mushrooms and pepperoni. Kill me already.My bf was very eager to eat here considering it is the first pizzeria in the United States. I didn't want to spoil it for him, but I was skeptical. I mean, how good can pizza really be? I was also hesitant to come here because we had just finished eating a pastrami sandwich at Katz's and a lox and bagel from Russ & Daughters. Ahhh life as a tourist, can't complain.When the pizza came out, I spotted it from afar and it was as though we locked eyes. I've never seen such a beauty. The vibrant colors of pepperoni, basil, and mushrooms were painted on a canvas of extra white mozzarella cheese. Bordering this masterpiece was the outer crust with char bubbles from being baked in the hot coal oven.But let's not be shallow, it's what's inside that counts right? At first bite I knew in a heartbeat that Lombardi's pizza was beautiful inside and out. The dough was crispy but chewy yet tender and soft. The cheese was oozing from my mouth as I struggled to detach it from the pizza. The flavors were robust and every ingredient contributed to the pizza as a whole.After writing this review, I'm nearly salivating. Pizza anyone?",1/6/2011,224,56,95,hB8faQt61zh-54dVmXOoiA

2412,Pia V.,1,4,"I must say that this pizza was pretty good.  The neighborhood was very quiet for new york at night.  First walking in, there was quite the line and our quote was a bit long ... so we went to PinkBerry down the street while we waited.  But while we were gone our name was called, so be prepared to be called sooner than your quote time.We came back and they had a table ready for us.  So as we were walking to our table we had to walk through their kitchen area.  We were then brought to a small little two top in their extra side room.  While walking through the kitchen though I noticed that they had a booth table in there, and that a family was eating there.  We were informed that we could reserve that table on any night so that we could be ""in the action"" and see all the foods coming through.  I thought this was very interesting, and probably would've tried it if my flight was not leaving the following day.The place is very clean and the decor was very tasteful.  Our server was for knowledgeable and attentive.  Our food came out very quickly, and I recommend that no matter what it is that you get to ask for the fresh garlic -- it is absolutely amazing with anything there.  We got a pizza and just added as much as we wanted on our own individual slices.  This pizza tasted great, but not the best pizza I had during my visit to New York.  Something that I didn't care for as well was that the water I was served was a bit warm, even with the ice =\.When I make another trip to New York I'll probably try to reserve the kitchen room and order a drink other than water =).",2/27/2009,1924,896,1664,CSvgpDZt8i_JvThh7E9Otw

There are not as many seats as expected to be considering the number of people are always standing outside this place around dinner time. There's two sides to the restaurant and a downstairs as well. There is a bathroom in each section, but even so there is still a wait for the bathroom since the line is so long for seats.We ordered a large 18 inch Margherita Pizza with half pepperoni and half meatballs. Both toppings were pretty good and amazing actually. We also ordered a pitcher of Sprite, which is listed to be equaled to 4 glasses, but I think we got more like 6 glasses worth.The check came out to be about $40 for a large pizza and two toppings and a pitcher of soda.

I found it to be OK. Now that ""ok"" is relative to other pizzas of this variety -- old-fashioned NYC pies with thin crispy crusts and San Marzano sauce, etc. I don't mean it's ""ok"" compared to a random slice. But the experience was not my favorite -- not Lombardi's fault, entirely -- but this neighborhood is so touristy at this point. I'd much rather be getting barked at by Cookie in Coney Island. It's cute and it's decent and it's the real deal, but you definitely feel like you're being sold a tourist experience. I wouldn't go there by choice.",9/24/2015,316,69,2,kqfxYdLzCWFbgGB10QXLUw

And the decor was true NY/Italian restaurant style. It felt like a cozy hole in the wall.We ordered their original margharita pizza, which is their normal pizza, with pepperoni and mushroom toppings. To say it was incredible is an understatement. The key to their flavor is the fresh mozzarella that it compliments your taste buds! Only problem was that it tends to slide right off the slice, so you have to maneuver the way you hold it up.Despite our fantastic experience, we were a little taken aback that for a large two topping, and two sodas totaled 43 dollars!

2434,Lauren P.,0,3,"Lombardi's, Lombardi's, Lombardi's. Where do I start? Do I revel in the narcissistic decor of Mr. Lombardi himself plastered on every inch of the restaurant? No, because despite the weird homage to the man himself, I'm here to talk pizza. My little sister and her friend were up from Miami and they wanted pizza. Now, I thought about taking them to to some local pizza joint where they could get the REAL New Yorker pizza experience, but opted for the tourist trap instead. So here's my beef with Lombardi's:  There was so much hype around this place having the best pizza in the city. Let's be real, I've had way better pizza that was tucked on the corner of some sketchy avenue in Brooklyn. The pizza was tasty, don't get me wrong. But my expectations were way higher than what was delivered. We ordered the margherita pizza. There was 4 of us and we were each able to have 2 slices each. I was desperately searching for the moment where I'd get out of my seat and sing the pizza good praises..it never came. The service was iffy as well. I felt like we were rushed. I mean, why not let us indulge in the savory flavors of Mr. Lombardi's ingenius pizza creation. ::side eye:: The ""legendary"" pizza shop definitely plays up it's story rather than the flavor of their pizza. But that's ok because different strokes for different folks. My pizza profile may not be complimentary to yours.

But of course lets be real, most any pizza is good with a bunch of toppings.Quite overrated but still good. Can't say I fell in love though.

They hand calculate it, and they charged us an extra $10. When we told our server, he didn't seem too unapologetic, didn't even make eye contact when he provided us the amended bill.

This has got to be one of the most authentic pizza's I have had. We shared a small classic pizza with roasted red bell peppers. 6 slices for $15.50 and an extra $3.00 for the roasted bell peppers. It came with 6 slices but these slices were pretty large. Crust: flaky yet not oily at all. I love how they crust is a little charred from the wood oven.Sauce:  Sweet homemade marinara sauce tops the crust. Not too salty and you can tell that it is homemade everyday. Cheese: no fake processed shredded cheese here. They use fresh mozzarella cut into large slices. Fresh basil: Gives the pizza just that extra little bit of fresh flavor. Wait was around 20 minutes and I have heard that people are willing to wait up to an hour in the cold for this pizza. Very homey feel. The tables are pretty much packed in every space and I felt like I could hear the whole conversation of the family next to us. Service: so so considering that this place is way understaffed and way too many customers in their small little building. Come back again?

Because there are better establishments that aren't overrun by tourist and  I can name 3 other pizza places within the same area that I'd rather go to for pizza. Now don't get me wrong...I've been known to be a tourist on many occasions but this one I give to them.

2456,Richard S.,0,4,"This is a cool spot to come to if you plan on coming with a small group because you can get a decent sized table, with actual space. I came with my dad to see what the ""original pizzeria"" was all about and we were seated at a very small, two seater table. The table was so small that our large margarita pizza took up the entire table, leaving virtually no room for our plates. Pizza was pretty good. It was basically what I expected, definitely nothing special though, but not everything needs to be the best. Atmosphere is nice, pretty lively. Crowd seems to be a mix of tourists and frequent customers. My only real complaint is the service. Our waitress was very kind when she first came to introduce herself but that quickly changed. She started by asking if we wanted to get started with drinks, to which we decided that we would order water just to start while we think about the actual order. I guess she got the five that we might be ""cheap"" (assuming we were going to stick with free water?) because she basically stone walled us after that. It's funny, we actually wanted to order drinks with our pizza order but because of her rude assumption we decided against it. After we received our pizza, she was basically non existent. I still give this restaurant 4stars because I believe my situation was circumstantial. The pizza was good, the ambiance is nice and if you get a big table then you should have a good experience...

2461,Harvey C.,0,5,"So my cousins were in town last weekend from Canada and i had to show them around. Of course I had to take them to eat some NYC coal oven pizza, eh? Let it be Lombardi's as that's what it's all aboot~! (""about"" in Canadian lingo).... NYC is known for its pizza and this is the one that I prefer. We ordered the following: 1) pie with pepperoni: the pie was great. However, the topping was just OK. In hindsight, the sparse pepperoni had no chance because how much better could it have been compared to the pepperoni of a local pizzeria with a conventional oven? yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm…2) pie with spinach and garlic: this was awesome and very TASTY. The garlic takes your pie to the next level and i suggest you get it on your pie any way possible. yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm…Random thoughts and tips: 1) wait time: we requested a table for 7 and waited aboot 25 minutes on a Sunday at 4PMish. 2) service: it was super fast and rushed. But if it wasn't that way, your wait time would be ridiculous; ya win some....ya lose some... 3) table request: let them know you don't want a table upstairs. It's very hot and kinda ghetto in there. Also, try not to go with as many people as I did because upstairs is where most of the large tables are 4) clam pizza: not a fan as it's too chewy and i rather eat clams with a nice pasta. Summary: If you want great pizza, this is the place to be as the pizza is very TASTY and it's a straight up PIZZA PARTY~!!! But if you want to have a romantic pizza dinner while whispering sweet nothings in your date's ear, this ain't the place. I suggest you look on Yelp to find a new place or Match.com for a new date...bwahahahaha =o/",7/2/2011,84,273,2328,ZXj26FqdOGR24p65c_KIrg
2462,David E.,0,4,"This antipasto at Lombardi's (firstpizza.com) was perfectly in my wheelhouse with prosciutto, provolone cheese, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, green olives, kalamata olives, artichoke and garlic bread.Unfortunately they were sold out of their ""clam pie"".  This wasn't quite New Haven (Frank Pepe's Pizza) good but it had a nice thin crust and the pizza wasn't overly salted.  The big clumps of creamy ricotta cheese were a nice change from mozzarella or provolone.Bella and I laughed as some neophyte jackhole and his girl sent back their pie due to slightly burnt crust edges.  Sorry to break it to you numb-nutters, but these coal-fueled ovens reach temperatures of 900-plus degrees Fahrenheit and as a result slightly burned crust edges are -- ""perfectly normal, perfectly healthy"".  Next time, head to Pizza Hut if you want a buttery, light beige colored, spongy textured crust.",1/16/2014,49,959,0,oHQYlPQ2wjK46vfjqTa9rA
2463,Aeramis F.,0,4,"Had this for my last dinner in NY. I didn't really know what NY pizza is all about (like how Chicago pizza is to deep dish), but I guess it's their thin crust? Anyway, we were seated promptly as soon as everyone in our party arrived. There were seven of us, so we got two large pizzas: one customized with sweet Italian sausage, sauteed garlic spinach, and mushrooms, and the white pizza that had a variety of cheeses but no red . Food came out fairly quickly, about ten to fifteen minutes after ordering.The sausage pizza was pretty darn good! I don't know if it was cause I was starving at the time but that pizza tasted amazing. I usually don't eat crust, but I devoured the whole slice! (Maybe I was hungry...) The only problem with that pizza was that it was a bit watery from the spinach and mushrooms, I assume they didn't drain out the water from washing it. Still good nonetheless, esp with lots of crushed red pepper. I wish I had some ranch handy..The white pizza, on the other hand, didn't really do it for me. Ricotta cheese was one of the many cheese toppings, which made my teeth feel sticky and gross afterwards. I wanted to brush my teeth immediately. After a couple of bites, I gave it to my sister and opted for the last slice of sausage pizza.Bill came out to be only $52, and we were all super stuffed!

I've had New York-style pizza before but I had never been to Lombardi's and wanted to try the first pizzeria in the US.We show up for lunch on a weekday and there is a wait but only 10-15 minutes. We look at the menu and see that you only get a margherita pizza to order and you can add additional toppings to that pizza. The small pizza ($15.50) with 2 extra toppings ($5) of fresh wild mushrooms and pepperoni was our decision. The pizza came out a short time later and it was beautiful. The colors, the warmth radiating, and the smell. Just a sight to behold. Once I got a slice, I immediately chomped down and could feel the crunch of the outer crust and the tenderness of the dough was evident as well. There was a taste of the char of the pizza from the crackling, hot oven and the toppings did not overwhelm, rather enhanced the overall experience of this Italian delight.You want to be able to have this pizza so remember to bring cash because plastic isn't allowed.

There are much better Italian restaurants in the neighborhood that have better pizza and are more reasonably priced. There is always a wait too, just for its namesake. If you're in Little Italy, I would recommend trying out some of the other restaurants before coming here.",11/30/2015,3,35,12,6xK6_AVzYPwRiR-7VvVqSg
2493,Katie W.,0,4,"I love this place! We make a point to come here when we're in the city. Beware, they only accept cash so come prepared. We usually sit in one of the smaller dining rooms (the one where the host leads you through the kitchen on the way to your table). It's quiet enough to carry on a conversation, and the exposed brick walls give the space character. Overall, the pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is great.

2494,Steven B.,0,1,"Ate here a while ago. Pizza was ""ok"". Nothing worth the long lines.Not clear what all the HYPE is about this pizza. Tourists LOVE it. Stand in line ALL day for it.No clue what they find so elusive about it. It is just a mediocre pizza",9/8/2014,146,48,11,vqm0x9P4rHg8Uj71cKRKrg
2495,Lisa T.,1,3,"Pizza here is pretty good. It's one of the must try pizza places when you visit NYC. Make sure your pizza has pepperoni. Only problem I had here was the slow service. My server kept coming to ask my friend and I if we knew what we wanted when we weren't ready. Then when we were, he was no where to be found. In fact, no server was around, so we had to wait for a while before we could even order.",7/15/2013,60,1412,6,AOFDB60pjiXby08lx5HHYQ
2496,Michael B.,0,1,"Not sure how to put this, they have no way of knowing how to cook a thinn crust pizza. The crust was raw if you want soggy wet raw pizza dough this is the place. Even after a refute the daw was colder, but they added more cheese on top of double cheese. The only reason why lombardis is remotely famous was because of your actual tradition of making a real New York Pizza. Now this is just a show. Stop never again",5/31/2014,9,16,4,9-jz7kgFh9JwGFUkUcGoyg
2497,Christina C.,0,5,"If I could live inside Lombardi's I would. The pizza is so tasty it makes me want to eat until blow up a la Violet in Willy Wonka. Thin, perfect pizza with just the right cheese on top. I have honestly never strayed from the original it is so good. I have heard that pepperoni is also delightful. As one of the oldest pizza establishments in NYC it is a great place to go if you are in the city on vacation. I highly, highly recommend it. I take my father here every time we are in town. Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Eat all of it.",12/18/2013,13,24,3,VAd2KMLsPIwIB8kp1meYmg
2498,Yuna D.,0,4,"Come here with ample time to wait--came here with the mister and we waited 20 minutes to be seated on a Friday at 1:30pm. I don't blame Lombardi's; it's lunchtime and this is definitely the place to have lunch at.Service is quick and attentive. We were seated at the lower level, which I definitely like more than the rowdy, loud atmosphere of the upper seating level. It was really quiet down there, and the ambiance was a lot nicer to munch away with your loved ones. We had sausage and pepperoni I think. The cheese is super gooey and stringy--I love good cheese. Wish there was more, but the tomato sauce, which I normally don't like, was very fresh and flavorful. A small pie is good to share between two people (we had a slice left over). The crust is definitely think. I kind of like fluffy crusts, so I don't know how I felt about that. One star off for lack of credit card use, and having an ATM that charges 3 dollars. Absolutely ridiculous in 2013. Make sure you have enough cash before you come here.",3/18/2013,446,355,16,0vgje_Rk-iGizQiNbsAyHA
2499,Lisa L.,1,4,"Love love love the pizza. Thin crusted. The mozzarella on their margharita pie is absolutely amazing, you can actually taste the freshness. Don't be shy to add some toppings, I found their pepperoni to be better than other selections. Wild mushroom comes runner up. And you have to try their clam pie at least once, it's a white pie with garlic and loads of clam that you wont be able to get anywhere else. Sometimes it runs out, so if that's what you have your mind on, be sure to call and check first. I'm a regular fan of the place, but what I feel like they can do better is seating and service. It's nice to sit upstairs but they don't have much room. Most of the time you end up cramped on a small table in the basement. And it's definitely not a place to go to if you want to have a nice comfortable and relaxing dinner where you can take time to socialize. This is one of those places where you eat then go before your food digests. Cash only is also a big con. But hey, not everything can be as perfect as pizza right?",7/14/2015,26,191,475,Pke4g6w4hSCuHr0KW6rHxw
2500,Daniel L.,0,2,"Whoever works for Zagat is an idiot. Sorry, you have NOT tried the best pizza in NYC. Yea, Lombardi's is known to be one of the first, if not the first pizzeria in NYC, but it does not mean it's the best. Think of Delmonico's Steak House. WHACK WHACK WHACK. Tradition runs the place over quality of the food.Yea, it's brick oven, but the place has its shares of slight inconveniences. It's cash only. There's always a long wait. You are charged full price for the toppings even though you'd like it only on one half of the pie (I'm okay being charged full, except I don't like the idea of having the increments be half or full). And it's not that good especially for the money you pay for it.The only good thing about this place is that it's right next to SoHo/Nolita, the shopping mecca of America. Convenient? Hell to the yes, especially after a long day shopping (yes even for me, a guy).Pitcher of beer = $20.Large Pizza with sausage, olives and mushroom = $30.The crust is a bit gummy, which I like. But it ends there. The sauce is okay, a bit sweet, but the mozzarella is mehhhhhhhhh. In addition, the pizza wasn't even cooked right. It just felt a little ""off.""If I were you, I would suggest you go elsewhere for better pizza. Yelp can lead the way for you, but Lombardi's are those who want the touristy touristy thing. Or those who want to sink in the aura of eating at NYC's supposedly first pizzeria. Even a $1 slice seemed tempting today in hindsight, but all is well with me and my soul. Hopefully my belly will follow suit too.",10/6/2012,455,223,72,w3l5rya0nSRX7ePixnnSRA
2501,M K.,0,4,"As tourists visiting New York for the first time, of course we had to make a stop at Lombardi's. No wait and we strolled right inside.We ordered two large pizzas, which were enough to feed 5 people (3 of which were hungry fellas). One margarita (did I spell this correctly?) and one white pizza. The margarita pizza was a fast favorite: crispy, delicious thin crust with savory pepperoni. I wish they put more cheese on the pizza, however, because some parts of the crust were bare. The white pizza (no tomato sauce) was okay. It was delicious, but not as delicious as the margarita pizza. It also was more expensive than the margarita pizza. They also skimped on the cheese for this pizza.2 large pizzas + 5 people = $13 a person including tax a tip. Not too shabby for what we were expecting for New York! I would definitely come back.",11/15/2012,599,423,0,ePUDFy1Ho0AqLPVLhhTSvw

Well, I had the chance to visit two renowned pizza places while visiting NYC (John's and Lombardi's), and I have to say that I was a little disappointed with Lombardi's for these reasons:1) The crust is too overdone (i.e., burnt) for my taste.2) The pizzas don't have enough cheese.  Although, they get credit for using sliced mozzarella.3) Their pizzas are loaded with sauce (I don't like a lot of sauce on my pie). Also, my hubby (the sauce lover) was charged $5 for two small cups of extra sauce!4) There are no free drink refills.5) You will wait a long time for a table.To their credit, service was fast once we were seated, and the server gave us advance warning about the above noted surcharges. They also cook their pies in a coal oven, which gives the crust a great flavor.  While I preferred John's Pizzeria, my hubby said that Lombardi's was the best pizza he had ever had.

2516,Ashwin T.,0,4,"We all like good surprises. What was surprisingly good about Lombardi's was the wait time. I live 2 blocks from this place and I've never seen it without a line around the block. Hence why I've never been tempted to go.But when my college roommate came to town and wanted to both check out my place and grab some authentic New York pizza, how could I not? I bit the bullet, and showed up there with a party of 4 at around 9PM on a Wednesday. Line around the block - no surprises. What was a HUGE surprise was just how quickly that line moved. I was seated at my table for 4 no less than ten minutes after getting there. What is deceptive about Lombardi's is just how large it is with its side room, back room and basement. Oh yeah, the food. The food was pretty great (as can be expected I guess for a restaurant with the renown of Lombardi's). Its hard to really impress me with Pizza, but it was probably just about as good a pie as I've had in the city. Coupled with a pitcher of cold beer, a lively and fun atmosphere and some great conversation, it made for a great night.

I do  have one piece of advice though, I'd recommend getting the pizza half white and half margharita so you can have the best of both worlds.I got half white pizza, half margarhita pizza with roasted red peppers. The white pizza was absolutely incredible--I was definitely more of a fan of this one over the margarhita pizza. The roasted red peppers were very yummy too, it was a great addition. I'm usually the type of person that takes full advantage of fancy add-ons on toppings and at any other place I probably would have put five toppings on top of it, but honestly, the pizza is so good in itself I'm glad I didn't ""taint"" it with toppings. I would just order it straight up so you can fully enjoy the taste of the pizza.The thin crust was also very yummy and kept me from feeling totally disgusting.

Definitely delicious. (To be fair, I'm from So Cal, so any real pizza blows my brain anyways.)There's a news article hanging near the bar that claims that Lombardi's was the first official pizzeria in the US. That's a pretty crazy claim, but then again, Lombardi's opened their first doors way back in 1905. And at that time, pizzas were only 5 cents. Darn that inflation! I'm thinking they need to start a recession deal. Who's with me?! The space is a lot larger than what you see on the first floor - there is a wine cellar with additional seating downstairs, so don't be too discouraged by the crowd of people waiting outside.The pizza? It's perfect. Crispy and gooey dough at the same time, and flavor flowing throughout; you can select your choice of toppings in whatever and whichever combination you prefer. It's cooked in a brick oven here, which I've been informed is one of those better-as-it-ages things.

You can really taste the basil, cheese and the tomato sauce. The cheese was cheesy and was melted to its perfect state, where it was chewy and soft enough to eat.

The kitchen is attached, but otherwise it's a completely different space.

I'm not a huge pizza lover but suggested I needed the best pizza in town. Upon our arrival our group felt excited to try new place when someone in our group asked for a sangria server the informed us manager asked not to serve us. We then proceeded to speak with manager than when asked how it was determined when not to serve alcohol. He answer it's determine by association and proceed to walk away. This is before getting our pizza after lack of service pizza taste as if I was eating dominos couldn't tell the difference really. You could say my pizza experience was ruin my this extablishment. No service no consideration for service or best of all respect for customers!!! All of our party included our local friends were shocken by the experience.,5/30/2016,34,5,2,JB6h2BxMjc11AeiK5K_hVw
2543,Ellen P.,0,1,"I was disappointed by the pizza here. I dragged my friend with me across town because I heard it was amazing and we were craving some pizza but lombardi's disappointed me...FOOD: We ordered a small with garlic spinach and roasted red peppers with half mushrooms and half sausage. The crust tasted like cardboard and was burnt. The pizza was soaked from the tomato sauce so the last few pieces we ate were very soggy. The pizza wasn't too flavorful and the italian sausage didn't have any taste to it. The only part I enjoyed about this pizza was the garlic spinach which was the only thing that provided flavor to this pizza. SERVICE: Service was horrible. Our waiter was not attentive or helpful at all. He was slow and did not seem to be eager to help us at all. He was also very unfriendly. Also, we had to wait 10 minutes just to get ice waters and they kept forgetting about the drinks we ordered so we had to remind them 4 times and wait 20 minutes before getting 2 cups of sprite...not a fan of the service here.Overall, very overhyped and doesn't taste great at all.",8/21/2013,60,145,196,ITPU0B9Cu8PqPib4hEbp1g

2547,Alissar T.,0,5,"Lombardi's is quintessential New York. It is my favorite NY pizza, the first NY pizza, and! America's first pizzeria. Founded in 1905, Lombardi's is located in Soho on Spring Street and is still making the same pies in the same coal oven. I've been to many NY pizzeria's (My Top 5 Favorites post coming soon) but nothing compares to the authentic Italian taste of Lombardi's.My favorite is their pepperoni pie. The best pepperoni I've ever had, cooked to perfection, with crispy edges and spicy bite. Extra cheese and their homemade meatballs are also great. Be sure to try the house salad with mesclun greens, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and their house vinaigrette. A simple and flavorful salad to go with your slice of NY heaven.

Only waited like 10 minutes which is much shorter than the 30 minutes we waited at grimaldi's. Besides that... i can definitely see why this is one of the best pizza places in the city! DELICIOUS. got the original pizza with garlic spinach, sausage, and mushrooms. enjoyed it very much. its that WET, SOGGY, WHITE MOZZARELLA CHEESE, THIN CRUSTED NEW YORK STYLE pizza for ya! We had the sangria and it was pretty good. They made it in the restaurant which is nice. but i wish they had fruits in it. menghhh. the best part is...

2550,Lina F.,1,5,"Nothing says New York City like PIZZA!  I like most New Yorkers have pizza sauce coursing through our veins and are super critical of pizza joints.  But I have to say Lombardi's was pizza heaven.  The wait for 2 was only 5-10 minutes on a weekday and as you follow your waiter through the maze of different corridors to your table, the fresh baked pizza crust smell just hits you!  Once you have sat, our eyes widen and your mouth waters as you take stock of what other patrons have ordered.  Your eyes linger and follow the pies of pizza as they march pass your table.  You eventually surrender to Lombardi's and get the original margarita pie with your favorite topping(s).The crust was just the right texture and thickness.  The cheese was googy and melty - perfect state for mozzarella to be on top of my pizza.  The sauce was so good, I wished I ordered a side to dip my crispy crust in.  We got sausages as a topping and it was delicious.  This is my first 5 star review - so please take stock!  This is a great pizza joint!",6/3/2011,159,340,637,8302qBEmZeTJZQY72xD4Sg

I tend to stop by prior to closing times and make quick work of the pizza / take it with us - the service has always been extremely quick; food is always out in minutes (10-15).Good atmosphere and good selection. The appetizers really need some work, but the pizza is really the main reason for coming here. My choice is always the same - large pepperoni pie w/ a pitcher of root beer or Italian vanilla soda.Key notes - they only take cash, toppings sure do tend to add up($3 each) and the wait tends to get ridiculous depending on the time you came, if you're arriving peak activity time on Friday/Saturday you're in for a bit of a haul.All in all, I've never been disappointed with Lombardis :-)",6/24/2011,296,299,202,UrRjWCqmAekPu0ifIVj8Yw

2557,Joe C.,0,3,"It's not as good as Pepe's pizza.  It's good, but not great.  The sauce was too sweet and had a thick paste-like consistency.  To me, a good tomato sauce retains its moisture and slides off your pizza when you tilt it.  Plus, I wasn't a fan of the solid islands of mozzarella cheese.  I understand that's the artisan style but I like my cheese shredded.  Oh and the pull test....Lombardi's cheese failed the pull test by not forming any strings when the slices were pulled apart.  Not one.Regarding the crust, yea, it was OK.  But I've had better crusts from coal ovens.  In fact, I've had better crusts from gas-fired and wood-fired ovens.",9/24/2011,27,1061,1821,iYwvHpgiLqBX2dFJhx7zBQ

Unfortunately, it's been a few years since I had Grimaldi's so I can't directly compare the two. The pepperoni was nice and crispy and the cheese didn't overwhelm the pizza. The caesar salad probably suffered from a little too much dressing but it was still good.SERVICE: n/a.

While waiting for our waiter, I asked a host for waters which were never delivered. Oh, and they still weren't delivered even asking the server.What was worse was the timing of the food distribution. Our pizza was brought out a full ten minutes before our other party's order, so we waiting and watched our food get cold until they could bring out the remainder of our meal.I would only recommend this place to someone truly passionate about seeing this ""establishment.""

But the center was completely soggy! It seems that due to the slow service there, the liquid from the mushrooms had soaked through much of the crust. The portion of the pizza closer to the crush tasted just fine.Next time I come, I'm probably getting 2 drier toppings.

I think it is completely overrated just because it is the first pizzeria in US. With all the history behind it and the fact that they use coal oven to bake their pies, I had really high expectations when I walked in here with my husband and two of our friends. First of all it is a huge tourist spot so it gets super crowded and of course pricey. We were already late for lunch and had to wait for an hour and a half to get in. That's not all once we got in the server told us that we will have to wait another 30mins to get our pizza. With all the wait involved we were still patient thinking at least all this wait will be worth it. But sadly that was not the case. The pizza was below average. I didn't like anything about it. Not the base, not the toppings and not even the cheese. We had also ordered bruschetta which was ok nothing much to say.

Excellent pizza.  Crispy, thin crust. Alot of sauce but it's not a spicy sauce, the fresh basil gives it all the flavor you need. Fresh fresh fresh mozzarella is the key. We got half meatball half pepperoni. The roni is crisped up a bit on the edges and the meatballs aren't over powering. Prefect. We didn't have appetizers bc we planned to hit up Eileens Cheesecake just around the block after. Between two of us we finished the small 14"" but were full.Price was average for the pizza but the toppings are a but high priced @ $ 3. Definitely the best we had in NYC. I would come back here.

You can only order a whole pizza.  However the pizza comes in different sizes.  My friend and I were able to comfortably eat a whole small pizza.   No soda refills  Normally these restrictions would bug me but they serve a great pizza so worth it!",5/19/2011,58,35,1,4f7fnDiid9bu1aHNUBp69g

I have only had the pizza here because the appetizers seem weak and Rice to Riches is across the street for desert.

I actually don't know what toppings they put on it. :S We took the box outside and just ate it outside the restaurant. I thought the pizza would taste much better since we haven't eaten since lunch.

The place is a tourist goldmine with a family style Italian feel. The mozzarella appetizer was good and fresh but nothing special. We ordered a regular margarita pie and a white pie. Both were delicious and the sauce is great. The freshness of the ricotta in the white pie makes this a good pizza. However I felt something was missing. The crust was a little bland and could use some air and crunch. Overall okay...

The decor and feel of the place was delightful. It felt super cozy but it wasn't stuffy. And it was a welcome sight after walking through the rain with no umbrella for 20 minutes. Even though there was a wait, they were quick and efficient. The service was excellent as the waitress always stopped by our table. I got the Italian soda which was whatever but the proschiutto, mushroom, super cheesy pizza was obviously to die for. There was cheesy goodness in every bite, the toppings were fresh, and I loved the fact that there was just enough sauce to give you the taste and flavor of it but not overwhelm you. It was a sort of a thin crust pie but it still had a solid consistency and I got full of 2 slices from the medium pizza.

2583,Alec G.,0,4,"They definitely have this thing down to a science.  Service was just fine, despite some canned conversations and stereotypical ""hey, you're here with a girl/friend/girlfriend/group/whatever so here are some pertinent one-liners"".  They've nailed the Italian kitsch, in fact it feels a bit like a museum in here.  Just good marketing, maybe, but you can't blame a super-popular place like this for trying to keep their brand consistent.  What am I even talking about?  Let's get to pizza.Fresh mozz is important, crust thickness and all that is way too subjective, so what's left really: the sauce.  Sweet, tangy, savory, not overpowering.  Maybe they got lucky or maybe someone a long time ago had a really sensitive palette.  Either way, Lombardi's has got the sauce:other ratio down pat.  This isn't the most original recipe, or creative, or challenging, or... cheap... but definitely satisfying.  It's pizza, whatever, just eat it.Come here for tradition, not craft, and you'll be happy camper.",10/10/2013,202,32,0,J68A7HyZcOXIonNEjuHzOA

What's not to like? Yes it's a bit touristy but sometimes you've gotta just grin and bear it. The decorations and whatnot are cool in my book. I've had the white pies here and they're great, but I think the original margherita is the best.This time we got it with pepperoni and mushrooms. Killer choice! The pepperoni is small but spread generously over the whole area of the pizza, and each one is perfectly crisp. The mushrooms add an earthy flavor that actually complements the rest of the ingredients quite nicely. A large fed three people very, very nicely.It's cash only so bring some greenbacks.",8/7/2012,107,433,221,Wqi04NdRUq4TvTVwIJ6q_g
2585,Steph C.,1,4,"If you think about it, the first pizza joint in America is unlikely to also be the best.  Other places are bound to tweak the original concept, while the first is bound to stay the same in the name of tradition.  Case in point - I live right by Louis' Lunch, the birthplace of the hamburger, and I can tell you that you've had a better burger, and probably several.Lombardi's is an excellent pizzeria, and its landmark status makes it a must-visit in New York.  To make things better, the experience is as hassle-free as you can hope for from a Manhattan institution.  I've been twice now, and while there does tend to be a wait, the staff knows how to run things.  You put your name down and wait outside, and before long, you get called via a loudspeaker.  Don't be intimidated when you walk up and find a crowded street corner - based on my experience, the wait is no more than around 20 minutes.  The service is refreshingly paced - not too fast, but not slow.  The space is nice as well, with homey old-school decor and plenty of comfortable seating.  The feel is cozy and traditional, just as you'd expect of an established Italian restaurant.You can't sit down at Lombardi's and not order the iconic Margherita.  This is a superb pizza, with delicious, tangy tomato and nice melted mozzarella, topped with plenty of good basil.  The crust is great, salty and chewy and very thin.  When you bite into this pizza, you get hit by the gorgeous balanced combination of these simple classic flavors.  Is it the best pizza you'll ever eat?  Probably not, but it's a delicious slice of history worth going out of your way for.I would also recommend the clam, though with a couple of caveats.  First, don't order just the clam - you want red pie at Lombardi's.  Second, if you're in New York, you're a mere hour and a half away from Pepe's in New Haven, and if you want clam pie to blow your mind, you're much better off there.  Third, at $26 for a small, Lombardi's clam is overpriced.  Still, it's worth trying.  The crust is a bit tougher and chewier than the crust on the Margherita, but in a good way.  It's topped with plenty of firm chewy clams and plenty of lemon and garlic, as well as a liberal dose of oil.Don't go to Lombardi's expecting to get knocked out of your chair, but do go.  The pizza is safely in the top tier in terms of taste and quality, and if you add to that its historical value, you have a required stop for any food enthusiast.",7/17/2010,3907,3618,96,WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ

2593,Jon Y.,0,5,"Lombardi's is the place to go for a very fresh pie (no by-the-slice options to my knowledge).  It's a little on the expensive side with a regular cheese pie of decent size running you about $19-21.  Their delivery range is great; they will go all the way down to FDR & Grand st. based on my experience and with the large amount of orders they are receiving, offer a fair delivery time of about 30-45min.  It's a great place to bring some out-of-towners or go yourself if you are sightseeing.  Keep in mind the price is a little on the higher end but you're paying for quality and ambiance/nostalgia.  Their pie: Is extremely fresh, always. A little bit on the thin side. Expect a ""splotches"" style pie, with intermittent generous amounts of fresh mozzarella and a great sauce underneath.  If you are dining in, be prepared to wait... especially on weekends, lunch-time, and nights.  Lombardi's is my favorite place to go for the type of pie they offer -- light, a little on the sweet side, and with fresh mozzarella.",6/16/2014,18,1,0,EnUD9CpZ6sOmJSngyC2cLQ

As a mushroom fiend, when wild mushrooms are offered I get excited. I'm not sure what was wild about the ordinary white button mushrooms that laid limp on my pizza. The other toppings weren't much better. And perhaps it was busy, but service was terrible.It was fun to sit in the restaurant that obviously is part of NYC history as evidenced by the ambiance and photos on the walls.

I'm sad that we couldn't add roasted garlic to it though.. I'm not sure if I like this place more than Grimaldi's pizza.. bc we didn't order the garlic white pizza that i LOVE from Grimaldi's. But it was still good pizza.It took awhile to get our food, but I imagine being on the second floor probably doesn't help either.

So to go to a place, not only sharing the same name as one of the best coaches/inspirators of all time, but also with a legendary rating, they had to impress.

I feel it was a bit over-hyped, but what isn't in New York that has been around as long as they have?!?   With a well done thin crust and a not too sweet sauce, this place had me very interested. However, if you don't get the pizza, I'm not sure the rest of the menu is worth. My wife had the antipasto, which turned out to be some salami and roasted peppers. Stick with the pizza and you should be all set. Not too sure about the toppings because they seem to be out of place on the pizza. I had the simple half cheese and half mushroom. The mushrooms stayed on, but if there was any other topping I imagine they would slide off. Even though I love the pizza style, the price and quality of the antipasto makes me think twice about trying anything else.

Maybe this is how they do it in Manhattan!I went with their famous Margherita pizza and it was DELICIOUS. The ingredients tasted so FRESH. The ratio of crust to toppings to tomato sauce is perfect.  The crust was thin and perfectly cooked in the coal brick oven. I swear I am going to invest in a coal brick oven for my place.

After that, we were quickly seated in their new back room. We ordered a couple of salads to start, and while otherwise a fairly ordinary salad, the creamy garlicky vinaigrette was flavorful and delicious. The pizza was also really tasty. The crust was on the thin side, and both crispy and chewy. We chose meatballs as our topping, and they were juicy and not too large that they overwhelmed the pizza.

They are not directly but regardless the food looked good.We ordered a small, perfect for 2 people, and added 1/2 meatballs, 1/2 pepperoni and all roasted red peppers.  While waiting for our food I had a couple pints of some Brooklyn lagers from the tap while Abby had the equivalent of a pitcher of their house sangria.

Drinks did the trick and our pizza was out pretty quickly after we ordered.The pizza was amazing!  I would say top 2-3 I've ever had and I consider myself somewhat of a pizza conisoiour.  The sauce was sweet and flavorful, the meatballs inspired us to replicate this at home, the cheese added the perfect amount of flavor and the roasted red peppers were a great addition.  The crust was nice and thin just like a NY pizza should be and it tasted very fresh.  Everything tasted like they used the best ingredients.There is no reason why you shouldn't try this place. It's in a great neighborhood too so there are plently of great little shops and stores to check out afterwards. Your also about 2 blocks from Chinatown, so if you want to experience that you can make an evening of it (which I would also recommend).",12/13/2012,184,136,125,OAN4FPoDiP2xgy6_9X5bbw

However, it should be noted that it's a major tourist trap. I came here during my first weekend living in New York and am glad I did. Lombardi's should definitely be experienced simply because it claims to be the first pizza establishment in the US. However, if you're looking for truly the ""best"" pizza in New York - try heading over to Luzzo's or Rubirosa.",7/27/2015,307,70,0,jApbB25vk8TOahdXVX87Rg

2630,Kiki I.,0,4,"This is how pizza should taste, when visiting New York this past weekend my friends and I had decided to give Lombardi's a try. The pizzeria itself isn't very big so seating can be a little cramped, but after a few sips of beer from the bar, were seated pretty quickly. We ordered a large half classic Margarita and the other panchetta, garlic spinach and mushrooms. The freshness of the sauce and cheese with the garlic spinach was great! The crust was tender and soft, best of all you don't feel greasy and bloated as you might with other places. The price is a little on the expensive side and they don't sell by the slice but what can you do.I'm not a New York pizza expert but I know what I like and this place is worth a visit.",5/24/2011,7,36,19,1xgOoQxczEEsYuH1YFMZog

The crust was dry thin and crispy, maybe that was the best thing about it, but it lacked any taste and character. I think the pie was precooked and that's a sin in pizza world.Tried to salvage the meal and ordered the Margarita but were only slightly less displeased by the offering.  The bland sauce and mediocrity of the cheese was matched in this case by a wetter crust.The staff was made up of I don't give a ship, Latino girls that were bothered by us and you know when the hostess is wearing the headset, leave. This is strictly a tourist trap.It's too bad, because we were walking towards Eldgidge St for dumpling and I was responsible for changing the course and trying Lombardi's for the first time.You can have my $90 for 3 salads and two small pizzas this time but never again.",9/9/2013,51,79,46,7VbQ9UKvM0cKQ2rylU-fSw

We were told this was excellent NY style pizza, not being connoisseurs of pizzas and pies, we just simply enjoyed it.

I came back last week and was so disappointed with what was a totally average pizza, boring even. There are so many places in NYC that do a better pizza, like Luzzo to name one.

Crispy, chewy with a soft doughy center that you can fold and bite into. The Buffalo cheese, I didn't really care for. It seemed dry and wasn't soft or stringy.  They say it's because of the water. Possibly if it's pH or the heavy mineral content. Not too sure, but I definitely havnt been able to fine a place in Los Angeles that compares to the dough of Lombardi of NY. Price was on the high side around $30 for 3 item toppings.  Next time I'm in NY I'll stick to my buddies recommendation of just a straight up slice!

2644,Kathleen N.,0,3,"Food ======$23.00 - White Clam Pie$24.00 - Half Ricotta & Meatball, Half Onions and MushroomsWhite Clam PieMy friend told me about this pie three years ago, so Lombardi's been on my hit list, but when it came out, I was summarily unimpressed. There were a lot of clams on the pie, but that's pretty much it. There was no flavor, besides when you squeezed on the lemon, and when you did it pretty much drowned out any possible subtle flavor (but since it's difficult to taste it anyways, it doesn't matter). Admittedly, they do it better than High Line Pizza, whom has an odd obsession with tossing on burnt garlic, but better than bad is still bad. For an impressive white pizza, I suggest Alexander's in San Fran. Regular Pie Sauce (Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil) + ToppingsI've had better meatballs. The ricotta was a nice touch together with the meatballs and recommended. The veggie side was per the norm. But honestly, the meatballs aren't as magical as it was made out to be in some of these posts.  Decor=======Really playing on the classic pizza diner, with red checkerboard tablecloths and wooden gilt frame chairs. Pictures of famous celebrities and the owner on one wall, good ol' coal oven on another, and of course lots of branding with ""the first pizzeria in New York"" and ""since 1905, coal ovens;"" that kinda thingService======It was between moderate and difficult to flag down a waiter, just cause they weren't about or they would congregate in the front. But once you got their attention, it was speedy and friendly.Where they were freakishly fast was the clean-up of dishes and the pizza platters on the table. Not even 30 seconds after it's finished, they swoop in. Guess they're used to waiting on busy nights, but it was not a busy night when we were there, so it was strange and a bit... rushed.

It's the oldest pizzeria in the country, has a coal oven and serves authentic margarita pies.

You may even see TV stars like Adam Richman, Guy Fieri or Tony Soprano eating right next to you. Word has it that it's cash only because that's how they did it ""back in the day"". You'll tell all your friends to make it the first stop after you check in at the Sheraton.Everyone else: Stay away. The pizza is serviceable but you could do better going to a Ray's. Sugar is not a spice. The service was terrible and the wait staff are a motley crew.

We didn't have to wait for a table because it wasn't as crowded. The first thing i noticed about the pie was that it was piled with toppings..unlike grimaldi's where you only get a few pieces scattered around unevenly. The crust was perfect, not too thin (grimaldi's=paper thin) and not too thick. AND it wasn't burnt either like...you know. I was able to taste every topping and it was delicious. The sausage slices were big and overall they are very generous on the toppings. If you were to eat at Grimaldi's you'd have to eat at least 4 slices to be full because it's THAT thin...again..paper thin. At Lombardi's all you need is 2? and maybe a 3rd to fill your tank..and it's good stuff.And even on a busy night..the lines will never be as long as Grim's because Lombardi's is 4-5 times bigger.

2670,Chris C.,0,5,"As a loyal Grimaldi's pizza eater for a number of years now, after trying Lombardi's I'd have to say that it tops Grimaldi's by quite a bit for their white pizza and makes slightly better margherita pizza as well. I think the main difference boils down to the crust, which I found to be much more flavorful at Lombardi's even though they both use coal-fired ovens.  Service was decent, not spectacular, but better than Grimaldi's as well. Lombardi's crust is a tad bit crispier and generally tends to capture the smoky flavors from the coal oven. Lombardi's white pizza also already comes with ricotta cheese on it, which you have to order as an additional topping at Grimaldi's. I've always known white pizza to come with ricotta cheese on it already, which is why I'm always surprised that I have to order it extra. It's like ordering a cheeseburger but then having to ask for cheese on it. If you're visiting New York and know you'll probably only ever get to eat here once, try a half white, half margherita pizza. I promise you won't be disappointed. Try both Grimaldi's and Lombardi's if you have a chance, but in general if you'd have to pick one I'd go here since it's in Manhattan and is located in a more vibrant part of the city. Wait times will probably be comparable at either place, though when we came on a Thursday night in early April we only had to wait about 15 minutes.",4/25/2013,634,474,262,m8ie5HQWIgQA1yD7FbiWAw

I've had Lombardi's and Grimaldi's during my visit, and my official vote is Lombardi's. Lombardi's pizza was still good after the first slice. The mozarella cheese is the best, it's nice and creamy and stringy. I like the tomato sauce that they use, and the pizza is nice and saucy. There are plenty of toppings, they don't skimp unlike Grimaldi's. Although you are paying about $5 more at Lombardi's, just splurge for excellent pizza. On the dough, Lombardi's is perfect. It's soft and crunchy. My jaw was hurting after awhile at Grimaldi's because it was too chewy. Go to LOMBARDI'S. Done.",11/3/2010,157,1126,594,JC99U5y-KAchZIjBhf_DiQ
2672,Tim M.,0,4,"Yippee!  Pizza!  That is what I would always say whenever I would have pizza when I was a kid growing up in southern California.  In southern Cali, Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesars rule the pizza world.  Having lived in NYC for the past 2+ years I have been shown the light.  Truly amazing pizza does not come in a pre-packaged, frozen box...it is made from scratch from the best varieties of flour, NYC water, a touch of sugar, some EEEE VEE double OH, and the love that a pair of pizza making kneading hands injects into a round (or square pie if you are Sicilian) tasty masterpiece.  It is cooked in an old school brick oven that is heated with coals.  And ohhhh boy does it turn out wayyyyyy good bra!!  Lombardi's is definitely top notch when it comes to pizza.  This establishment has proven through numerous generations that NYC pizza is the absolute best in the US.  Topped with your choice of fix-ins, the Lombardi pie comes with the standard tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, a sprinkle of Parmesan reggiano, and basil.  The smoky, lucious, gooey dough is absolutely delicious and is something I will crave for the rest of my days.  What makes this place even more spectacular is that even during the lunch and dinner rush, you will never have to wait longer than an hour (baring your party is greater than 6) which gives it an upper hand on those other brick oven guys in BK.  NOTE:  Dunno if they still do this, but if you order take out, they let you wait in the kitchen for it!",8/11/2010,109,59,9,JHF8AifYhRCG4uw2kVM7Qg

I had a whole mental list :) This is worth going to.  We had the brushetta appetizer and the original margarita pizza.  Both were excellent!! whenever I am back in NY I will return :) If I had to rate NY Pizza in order.... It would be Difara's, Lombardi's, My little Pizzeria, Originals on Avenue L and then L&B Spumoni :) The service here was top notch, the waitor did not forget about us and was really nice.",9/28/2013,197,53,12,ANzR73RKDqk4w5jTCDWyug

The only slight disappointment was that we were seated downstairs in ""the basement"" but no complaints, we were just happy to be seated in less than an hour!We ordered a classic small pizza with onions, mushrooms, and red peppers (each $3 per topping). Fresh chunks of mozzarella and basil leaves generously topped the pizza and it was immediately clear that everything was prepared fresh on-site. And the crust...so delicious!

We finally found a parking space (got a $95 parking ticket, gonna fight it, there were no signs posted anywhere.)We got to the restaurant about 1pm and were seated immediately. The place is very small, not much room to move. We ordered the Bruscetta, Italian soda and two pies (margherita and supreme).The food was awesome, best pizza ever. Although the Italian soda was good just not to my liking. It was a bit pricy for pizze, $60 for three, but it is New York and this is the first American pizzeria. I would definitely go back.One note of caution, they do no accept credit cards although they do have an ATM in he restaurant.",5/16/2013,49,75,23,eHrtrd8JHtWhVlVQC4u6Rw

I had their bruschetta which was okay, and I loved the salad, but the pizza was just amazing. I really enjoyed their pepperoni, its smaller and thicker than what I'm used to on the west coast.

The small size was perfect for two - the large (18"") looked enormous and would feed 3-4 easily. The pizza was terrific: thin crispy crust and fresh toppings and seasonings, with a super flavorful tomato sauce!

We ordered a margherita pizza and polished it off between the two of us. This is pizza that is supremely flavourful, is not greasy in the least, and tastes fresh, fresh, FRESH! The mozzarella is FRESH from a local place just around the corner, the sauce is zesty, and the crust is thin, flavourful, crunchy and TO DIE FOR. You'd think we'd have serious 'ITUS after consuming a huge pizza like this. But nope. We felt great, not gross and overly stuffed to the gills.Best pizza EVER, hands down!

I blame it on the gigantic party of 20 people that took up half the tables in the place, as I proceeded to stare them down from the outside, trying to will them to eat faster (just kidding, sort of).  Be prepared to wait for your pizza as we had to wait a good 20 minutes for our pizza after we ordered, all during which we were subjected to the delicious smells wafting over from the pizzas at other tables...ahh it was torturous. We ordered the margherita pizza half w/ no toppings and half w/ sausage. The sausage is DELICIOUS...so flavorful.

2721,David G.,0,3,"Not bad.  Maybe it would have been better had I not had it delivered.Everything tasted fresh, but I think my problem was with the crust.  It was a bit to chewy and floppy.  It wasn't as bad as the crust at Ben's, which is so tough to chew it's practically inedible, but still, rather chewy.I did like the home made meatballs they used as a topping.Overall, not bad, but not my favorite.  For the price, there are other pies in the area that I like much more (Prince Street Pizza nearby is great).Still, that being said, Lombardi's is a slice of history, so it's kind of a must try.  I'll give it another shot, too, and see if I like it better the second time around.  I'm really thinking the delivery might have killed it . . .",5/18/2013,1,114,4,UDEsNcES3AxzfKyRFLvt6Q

I have visited NYC and Lombardi's twice in the past year and the quality has dropped significantly. They have become cheap with the toppings, the service is lackluster, and the quality of the pizza/experience is so much less than it once was. They don't even cover the pizza with cheese anymore...the Zagat reviews reflect this as the pizza used to score 28 and now is a 24. Not worth the wait. Go to Grimaldi's or john's instead.

They were awesome. Meaty in the center but thin on the outside so it crusted up during the bake. They're sort of like mini-pizzas themselves on a pizza haha!Then with sauteed garlic spinach. This was clutch. This added that great burst of flavor that really made the pizza. To die for, seriously.The only flaw I can say about this place was that they totally skimped out on the sauce. But otherwise, the cheese, crust, and all the toppings were brilliant. I definitely wanna come back and see how all the other toppings fare but I have to recommend that any pizza ordered gets extra sauce. That's that key factor that would bump this score up to 5 stars!

This is great, brick oven style pizza, so don't expect it to be your typical NYC slice that you can buy on the corner. The cheese and sauce melt together pretty well with the toppings, the crust is crispy (some parts are burnt, but then again, it's brick oven). The service is pretty fast, and they are all friendly enough. I recommend this place if you're going on a pizza tour, if you're with a group of friends, or if you're out on a date.

Unreasonably small mouth opening girl      B.) Too much tongue guyYes, both are absolutely the worst super power to have, but that is besides the point.  I like to equate a kiss from these ""super"" heroes to be what Lombardi's is like.  Lombardi's is insanely overrated for the wait time.  As with all things that become famous in New York City, you're going to have to wait an obscene amount of time for food.  Not only is the wait long, the tag is pricey.  It's going to be close to 30 bucks for two of you.  And the pizza, while delicious, is pretty soggy.  And if you're a follower of my yelping, I HATE SOGGY STUFF!  But all in all, pizza is pizza.  And mozzarella on anything is going to make it delicious.So look, if it's your very first kiss, no matter how soggy it is, you're going to think it's pretty awesome.  And as unreasonably long the wait, or no matter how unreasonably high the price, a kiss is still going to be a kiss (so it'll be nice).  But once you pucker up with someone that knows what they're doing like Grimaldi's, or Patsy's, or Joe's, or Difaras.... You're going to quickly notice how incorrectly they were doing it all along.  And thus born-eth the ""super"" villains unreasonably small mouth opening girl, and too much tongue guy.",4/10/2012,131,81,14,vDH0-cP_N7j7KCuXjN4Z7g

I'm from LA and this was my third visit to NYC. The inside of the restaurant is neat, I liked the set up. The pizza on the other hand was terrible. I know NYC has some great pizza joints but after eating here I was so let down. I've had way better pizza at downtown Los Angeles. First of all, the pizza was black on the bottom it was obviously burnt and that definitely came through in the taste. They were packed so we did not want to cause a delay by letting them know but the fact that they would so causally serve that was alarming. The pizza barely, and I mean barely, had any cheese on it. There was more Arugula on my pizza than cheese! No thank you. Also, it definitely was not cheap. We ended paying a little over $50 for a crappy pizza and an appetizer. Also, the toilet was clogged. Nice server though.

Lombardi's is definitely a well known NYC pizzeria, which is why it was on my bucket list of places to go. The service is incredibly fast. We got seated right away, ordered, and our food was out to us in minutes. I was so grateful for that because I was incredibly hungry. My brother and I split an order of bruschetta, which was served on a ciabatta type of bread. I really enjoyed it because they loaded it with tomatoes. Not your typical bruschetta, but no complaints here. Now the pizza. NOMS. You can customize it any way that you want. My brother and I ordered a large margherita pizza for base, which was way more pizza than we needed (yay leftovers), and we got pancetta on half of the pizza. The pancetta was amazing. The mozzarella was some of the freshest and cheesiest that I have ever had. Overall great pizza. I would definitely come by to pick up some to go or have a huge group of people.

They have small and large sizes of pies and then you can choose your own toppings.We ordered the large pie with 3 toppings, pepperoni, meatball and garlic spinach. It came about 20 minutes after we ordered but it was worth waiting for!The pie crust is crunchy and chewy at the same time.

We walked over from Avenue A and 2nd Street bundled up in our East Coast winter gear while our Californian mild-weather accustomed bodies wanted to go back to the warm apartment and order in from the pizza place a block away. But it was our last night in the city so we braved the frigid weather to try the pizza from the ""first pizzeria in America"" and ""best pizza"" per a Zagat survey. Service was quick despite the full house and our pizza arrived in no time at all. After all the hype and talk about pizza from Lombardis I was excited to taste their pizza. Alas, after the initial bite I was a bit underwhelmed. I've had better in other parts of the city and heck even in (gasp!) California. I'm not sure I buy into all that ""it's in the water"" talk that I hear about the NY bagels and pizza. But I know that this is a never ending debate that NY pizza purists won't ever let down.

I wasn't even hungry having had Rice to Riches right before Lombardi's but I still put down one of their amazingly large pizzas. I'm not even a pizza person but this pie doesn't discriminate when it comes to wowing your taste buds and satiating your stomach. We ordered a large sausage and mushroom pizza and that behemoth was just the right amount for two people...about three slices per person. However, the pizza is so good, you might order several like the three dudes sitting across from us that ordered three pies. The cheese was exquisite. The meat...succulent. The sauce...supreme. Plus, the crust had a nice crispness to it that makes for a fantastic pizza both in texture and taste.

2766,Tiffany C.,0,4,"I love, love, love pizza.  Lombardi's is one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  I don't want to say it's THE best because I've eaten a lot of good pizza, and after a while they do start to run together.  If you're looking for the typical ""New York slice,"" you won't find it at Lombardi's though.  I would say it combines the best of the flavors, toppings, and textures of pizza by slice with the best of a coal-fired pie.  Slightly greasy, quality toppings, great flavor, and awesome crispy, light crust.  I don't know how to explain it better.  It's good, just try it.With that being said, I cannot and will not give a restaurant 5 stars if they do not take cash.  No matter how good your food is (and the pizza is bomb), I know I'm not going to deal with the hassle of visiting when there are places that are comparably good that take cards.",10/22/2013,1,10,0,LE1P9vG8EdqfKFSPRtAkgw
2767,Jason Y.,0,4,"Actually ordered this as delivery (which saved the wait in the monster line!) This is definitely an interesting pizza. I don't know if they do it on purpose to show how it is the 'ancestor' to modern NYC pizza, but I was intrigued by the slight imperfections in the crust making it really feel hand-made. So yeah, we made our own, mushrooms and sausage. Loved the crispy coal oven crust. In the end though it wasn't as awe-inspiring as I had hoped it to be. Also for $20+ it is a tad expensive... But hey, if you have visitors from out of town, maybe take them there. They are the 'first pizza' after all.",5/11/2013,290,42,0,uxrUxi4usdXXgR8Oahe52w
2768,Margaret W.,0,5,"Personally, I LOVEEEEDD Lombardi's. I usually don't really indulge in pizza THAT much, but there was something about the CRUST and the CHEESE (OOOH the cheese ... was AMAZING). We had two large pizzas (one with spinach and mushroom and another half sausage/half anchovies). WOW. We had to order another small because we loved it so much (We got the original marguerite pizza). All of them were AMAZING (except I'm not a big fan of Anchovies)... I STRONGLY recommend the marguerite pizza because the basil combined with the cheese creates an amazing experience of subtle tastes!!!It was definitely a fun experience. Little Italy is always a place to go for a lively lunch. We were definitely full, but it wasn't even that costly. I got to eat close to 4 slices (as did everybody else) and we only paid around $14 each. Just be careful: They only accept cash!",7/16/2012,690,18,4,a5JMp-uPm-xWAWJ_fnCHDw

The crust was over done, the sauce and mozzerella didn't seem as fresh.It was very very busy, as I'm sure it always is being so famous.

The service was quick and the busboy kept mentioning manny pacquiao to us which I liked.

The history behind Lombardi's is also pretty interesting being that it is the 1st ever pizzreria in the US. Pretty impressive and evident in the pizzas they make.  I'm not even a big fan of pizza, but I suppose that's due to not having had quality pizza.  I love you, Lombardi's and cant wait to visit you again!",2/13/2011,290,268,180,klHHSCnS585M05uACWK5nw

It is cash only. Old fashioned but! The pizza is delicious. We came in on a friday night around 7:00PM. Surprisingly there was only a 10 minute wait, so we sat by the bar and ordered ourselves a fancy glass of Zinfindel. It was kinda pricy,  7 bucks that bottle can be bought at TraderJoes for 5.99. Bleh!The service was extremely nice. They all seemed like they were all family and carrying their ancestors tradition. I don't exactly remember the specific kind of pizza we ordered. But it was a 25in with sausages, mushrooms, onions and peppers. The classic staple to make a delicious pizza. The crust was light crispy but still had a dough-y bite, the tomato sauce was perfect-- not too tart or sweet, the sausages taste like the season it on their own, and the veggies were cooked but had a crunch. A pizza lover like me can not pass up on a touristy area where the first pizzeria opened. A group of 3 were able to finish the whole pizza. I can only eat at most 2 slices, but that night I had 2.5.

You can tell the pizza is made with all fresh ingredients. The crust is smoky and thin, the sauce light and the fresh sliced mozzarella is the perfect topping.

There are three basic pizzas that you choose from. The toppings are separate. We got the margherita pizza, which comes with red sauce, cheese, and basil, with sausage, olives, and mushrooms as our additional toppings.

Topped with the wild mushrooms of different textures, fresh olives that didn't taste rubbery at all, and tangy pepperoni, these alone would have made for a flavorful combo- but it's all about the sauce. I have no idea what the secret recipe is, but the tomato sauce is to die for! Seasoned just right with the proper proportions of salty, herby, and sweet, I fell head over heels for this pizza. The only drawback was when I looked over at my friend who was sharing my pizza and noticed he had black charcoal- like marks all over his face and I realized it was from the pizza crust straight out of the oven. Just had me wondering if my face had the same camo- look :) but just added to the flavor, in my opinion.",4/29/2015,122,96,13,8iboMve0kaB1tunZkYENKg

It *might* have impaired my judgment. But I am not sorry about it!What I loved:- the crust. Pretty close to perfection if you ask me. And that's no small task.What I disliked:- the tomato sauce, bland and seriously under-seasoned. If you have to constantly reach for the salt shaker while eating, it's a fail in my book;- the $3 price tag per ingredient added on a margharita - that's steep but hey, that's NYC I guess...still:- the atmosphere, too ""chain-like"" in my opinion and highly reminiscent for that Chicago gal of Pizzeria Uno. Do take a stroll by the kitchen though to have a look at the 1905 oven. You won't see that every day.No wait on a Wednesday at 5:30 pm. Yes, I am on a grandma schedule but it comes with its pros, and you are working quite an appetite when you walk 26 miles in three days.

2790,Peter M.,0,5,A friend of mine who has lived in NYC his whole said I have to eat pizza at Lombardi's.  I am a food snob and my wife is a pizza snob so it is hard to impress us...  This place was AWESOME!!!  When we walked up to it there were people waiting all over the place and all around the place so we were very worried.  We only waited about 30 minutes so we thought that was impressive.  It is hard to decide what you want as you walk through the place and see all kinds of interesting pizza's.  I read one review on Yelp before we came and the person said order extra mozzarella and this person could not be more right.  Order extra mozzarella!!!   We got one large pizza and half was pepperoni and the other was meatball with basil and mushrooms.  A large is easy to split as the crust is thin and amazing.  We also had great and friendly service!!!Many people around us had the clam and seafood pizza and they were eating it like crazy.  Next time we go we are going to try that pizza for sure.Get off your couch and go see the world!!!  Go to NYC and get a real slice of New York Pie!!!Enjoy what you eat and enjoy your life!!!,1/30/2012,4,88,11,ctJ2cfrNL-0uB01FQwj1Mg

I'm not saying it's not good but it's just okay. Good thing we came on Friday with 5-10mins of waiting otherwise would be so not worth it. And not to mention peeps, it's overprice for pizza. But I tell ya, I'm a sucker! My husband's quote: ""I grew up here; I eat pizza all the time, I don't give a damn for $35 pizza!!! That's for tourist"" there you go, I said it! But I didn't try the clam one tho, even though I really want it! But 1 pie of clam on pizza, who would take the risk if they don't come with 10party, on top of that its $35. I did ask if I can but one slice since my 3 other party not a fan of clam. But they said: sorry! If anybody interested to share me a slice of clam pizza! I'd rewrite my review.

That kind of euphoria when you eat something that is good for you-- if for no other reason than it is made with fresh ingredients.  My father, boyfriend, and I split a large pizza with wild mushrooms on half. My boyfriend declared he could eat a whole one himself, but after three pieces was just right--Not too full to walk around SoHo for the rest of the afternoon. After two pieces, I felt great. I watched a husband and wife kill a whole large themselves--with toppings. It's just that good. The crust really is thin. Snappably so. The cheese is fresh and the sauce is slightly sweet. I loved it. My friend from France said Americans don't know pizza after seeing the picture I put up on Facebook. This may be true, but I think it's safe to say a 60 year old italian guy from NYC knows where to eat and said this is where we should go.

2809,Jillian K.,0,2,This place is so so. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. It's annoying if you are trying to go with a large group. They don't take reservations. We had a group of about 12 tonight. Not everyone was there right at 7. A few cane later.  They told my friend they wouldn't give us a table until everyone was there. That sat us separately as 2 tables in the upstairs room above the kitchen. Room was spacious compared to the regular dining room. Our tables weren't near each other so we waited until a nearby table left. Then they let us move closer to our friends. Star for that. Pizza in my opinion was just ok. Good crust...that's partly because NYC has good water. Sauce was kinda meh...like they opened a can and poured it out. No spices or flavor. Cheese and toppings were fine. Our group ordered tomato and mushrooms on one and sausage and peppers on the others. 3.00 for every topping seemed a bit steep.,1/27/2013,18,133,38,aaOGTynb4rCoY6fPwHSzgg

The crust was soggy by the time it got to our table and extra chewy after finishing the first slice. Not bad pizza per say but doesn't taste good cold.

We got a regular small with sausage and shared it between the two of us. The bottom was a bit soggy when I expected some crisp. The ingredients were good, but I don't think it's very hard to just put fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce on a pizza. If the price was a little cheaper I would have given it 4 stars, but it's going to stand at a 3 for now.

I'd rather go to my $1 pizza slice place and stay full, rather than come here, eat a $5 slice (dividing the pizza by how much we paid) and then getting hungry an hour later.

2830,Edward E.,0,4,"(More like a 3.5 but there isn't an option to do so.  It did well enough to deserve the 4 though)I went here with two friends from out of town for some lunch.  It was about 4 to 4:15 PM on a Wednesday and there was no line to be had.  We asked for a table of 4 because we originally were going to wait for one more person, but they were unable to attend.  SEATING:[Please note that all members of your party should be in attendance.  They will not seat you if there are missing members of your party.  We asked for a table for 4 and were asked to wait so they could seat the other customers that had their full party in already.]  Luckily after we informed the greeter that we would only be a party of 3 not 4 and were promptly seated.  From what I can tell small parties get whisked away to the back, where you will get a glimpse of the kitchen en route to your table, while larger parties are seated in the front or in a middle room where larger tables are found.ORDERING:  After we were seated, we were handed menus and left to look over them while the waiter went back to get us some water and straws.  Being new to Lombardi's we asked if we could have a few minutes to look over our options (which aren't too many, which is good since they can concentrate on making what they do serve better), which the waiter patiently abided by and asked if we wished for anything else to drink in the meanwhile.  They have a few beers on tap as well some fairly common bottled beer (Sam Adams, Sierra Nevada, etc.) about 10 beers in total at $6-7 bucks a pop.  They have wine, but I know nothing of wine and just stuck to beer.  We eventually settled on one large pizza, half meatball and the other half, sauteed spinach.  Toppings are $3 each with ""half side"" toppings being $2 each.  If you'd like you could also order toppings on the side for about $4-5 bucks.  After what seemed to be about 12-15 minutes, the pizza arrived which is pretty quick but not as quick as I had seen Lombardi's proclaim on various television programs (5-8 minutes) but that could have been due to not wanting use to throw napalm into our mouths.  It was still hot when it got to us.  TASTE:  Probably some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had.  Even the outer crust was quite a bit lighter and crispier than I've been used to from majority of other NY pizzerias, probably due in part to their dough as well as the coal fired brick oven.  Just a slight bit of chew but it was crisp and tender.  The sauce is good, the cheese doesn't slide off, but I had an issue with the toppings, not so much for flavor, although I would probably not go for the meatballs again, but the lack of toppings.  I had a look at some other pizzas coming out and they seem to have more.  Bad luck I guess?  The sauteed spinach though was good, slightly garlicky which I enjoy.CONCLUSION:  If there was a "".5"" star system on yelp this place would rate about 3.5 out of 5.  And don't let that deter you from actually going to Lombardi's, because they have great thin crust pizza.",5/29/2013,0,20,3,9B771ubO_mAn5vYzfU8Wcw

Maybe they were good from the very beginning, but somewhere along the hundred years that they have been open, they have sorely tanked in terms of quality.  Think I give a flying f*** when they opened?!  Think again.  Keep up with the standards.....

2836,Amy S.,0,3,"When discussing the ""best pizza in NYC"" Lombardi's is name that is bound to come up. After all, it's an institution - not just NYC's first pizzeria but the first pizzeria of the US. The first time I went to Lombardi's was when I moved to NYC years ago. I went again this past weekend with friends who were visiting NYC for new year's. Since Lombardi's doesn't take reservations we resigned ourselves to the wait. Our group of six waited for about an hour to be seated on the covered rootop that we had to walk through the kitchen to get to. It's good that they're making the most of their property especially considering the crowds that are clamoring for their pizza, but there are definitely good and bad seats at Lombardi's. A drafty rooftop in the middle of a New York winter ain't one of the good ones. Oh well, great company makes up for most things.Our group of six shared the...HOUSE SALAD (mesclun greens, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, house vinaigrette) yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm… and CAESAR SALAD (romaine, rustic croutons, shaved parmesan) yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm… - Both salads were basic but good, with fresh ingredients and just enough dressing.BREAD STICKS (six, served with sauce) yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm… - The first thing I said after a bite of my bread stick was ""Oh. These really are just bread.. sticks."" Indeed, Lombardi's breadsticks are just bread in stick form. No garlic. No oregano. No parmesan. No dusting of seasoning. No nothing. Olive Garden's bread sticks beat Lombardi's bread sticks.  MARGHERITA PIE (large) yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm… - We decided to stick to the basic margherita without any extra toppings since the menu announced it as their original pizza. The mozzarella was fresh and creamy and really made the pizza. Unfortunately they were as stingy with the basil as they were generous with the fresh mozzarella. There were only a few sad chopped basil leaves on the entire pizza. When I order margherita pizza I expect beautiful green basil leaves dotting my pizza and Lombardi's didn't deliver. They also didn't deliver in the crust department which I thought was dry and not at all what I expected from a coal-oven pie. Either go thinner and crispier or doughier and chewier please!CLAM PIE (small) yelp.com/biz_photos/WIhm… - This was my favorite thing from dinner. Though the crust was also a little dry like the margherita's the clams provided a flavorful mouthful. And with more than two dozen fresh-shucked clams baked on top of the pie, you're guaranteed clam in each bite. It was delicious with a fresh squeeze of lemon.All in all, it was a good meal but it was far from a great one. Despite what the constant crowds waiting to eat at Lombardi's would have you assume, I think Lombardi's is past it's prime. That said, it's worth trying just once for it's historical significance.*Cash only?!",1/3/2012,271,308,2495,M5wSKr2IZhQlyzh4dJKF6g

The waitress was not that great. Who brings soda before the waters? And another waiter spilled water on the floor, on my foot and my flipflops. And he just left it there. We said thank you to our waitress as we left, and she didn't even have the courtesy to nod her head or smile or anything. She ignored us and went to the next guest.

2842,Oanh N.,0,3,"I was so excited to come here and try the pizza.  It was my last stop before heading back to LA and I actually waited at a cafe nearby to be here right when it opened.  When I got here the restaurant had all these plaques and banners saying it was ""the best pizza on the planet"" by Zagat, it's a historical landmark plaque, and etc.  So seeing that my expectations kept climbing up higher and higher.Luckily I didn't have to wait in any like some of the Yelpers so coming right when they open at 11:30am is the best bet.  I only ordered the classic Margherita pizza in a small pie since that was their famous pizza.First bite: why is this not knocking my socks off?  I was getting disappointed because I was expecting it to taste better than the 99 cent fresh pizza I had the night before.  The cheese fell off very easily so every bite I had to be careful to not pull all the cheese off.  I also didn't like how the pizza was floppy.  The pizza overall did taste good but it didn't taste like the best I've ever had.  I did like that it wasn't greasy, the cheese tasted good, the tomato sauce complemented the cheese well, and it didn't feel heavy eating it.  I guess the only thing I see where the hype is that it's the very first pizza parlor in the US but in regards to taste... I know I've had better in New Jersey and I compare all of my pizzas to that one place.  I can't remember what the place is called but it was the shit.  Well at least I can say that is that I've eaten at Lombardi's before.Cost: 1 small pizza pie: about $20 total.",1/11/2010,1585,244,450,1Edd8rwruLx-_m6LVRc0Yg

2846,Jennifer L.,0,4,"Looking for the first pizza in NYC?  As well as a complete tourist trap? Then look no further!! Was brought here originally last summer on a pizza tour that my out of town friends wanted to go on.  Lombardi's was surprisingly the best stop of the bunch.  The pizza was delicious, crust was crispy throughout the whole slice, nice fresh ingredients, etc.Came here again to bring our friend who had never been and it wasn't as good unfortunately!  We walked in on a Saturday (maybe it was a Sunday??) night and were seated immediately at their seating area next door to the main restaurant.  We had to walk down the street to get to it.  We ordered a regular fresh mozz pie and it was tasty, but not as crispy as I remember the first experience.  We also ordered a salad, which was ok.  The vinegar overpowered the entire thing.  And a side of meatballs, which were yummy but nothing compared to my grandmothers.  So even though this place screams tourist, I secretly enjoy it.  :)  It's definitely a contender whenever I'm in the area and craving some decent pizza. And yes...no credit cards sucks.",3/12/2012,296,354,269,6Q-gKLKATA0IIlOnUoQx8w
2847,Dave K.,1,2,"I had Grimaldis and I absolutely loved it. With all the cheese that's oozing and the grease overflowing, I can't get enough of it. Well worth the wait. Then I hear Lombardi's is just as good. So the foodie I am, I decide to go and try it out. Went to the restaurant and waited for about 20-30 minutes on a Monday night. Expected a wait and got it. Shorter than I thought it would be. Got seated, friendly waiters, great service. Decided to get a sausage pie.  Pretty much a plain margarita pizza with sausage. Simple right?Let me tell you, this place is SO OVERRATED.  I've never had such plain lame pizza in my life. There was barely any cheese. Just felt like the person who prepared this pizza wanted to just go home and sleep. Why do people love pizza? It's because of the cheese. Put some care into the pizza, PLEASE! I will never come here again. It's not worth the wait and I can definitely find pizza just as good around the corner of my apartment.

2848,Kayla S.,0,2,"Pizza was... Ehhhh. I had so many expectations for this place because of its name but really the pizza was good, but not that great. I had the classic margarita pizza and the sauce and cheese were good but not exceptional. Honestly I much rather prefer Grimaldis in DUMBO or John's Pizzeria in the Times Square/Hells Kitchen Area. This place just didn't have the fresh basil and crunchy soft crust in comparison to those two. Would I come back here? Probably not.",5/18/2015,0,23,12,imGzTQVc85p0ojB7WUuReQ
2849,Alon X.,0,2,Pizza was just like any other pizza I've had nothing great way overpriced a margarita pizza was okay $26 I believe for a large Meatballs we got on the side for seven dollars but it was just as good if you would've added it to the pizza I don't think I'll be back there much better places in New York City for much cheaper prices in Brooklyn or even on Bleecker StreetNot worth it.,5/18/2015,5,316,7,Vpl6RhBPJIkGUaCKmLqgaw
2850,Nick P.,0,3,"This place is overrated and overpriced. Don't get me wrong the pizza was decent, but certainly not worth the reputation/markup it receives.

2852,Stephanie S.,0,5,"Must try for locals and tourists.This was the first licensed pizzeria in America and the BEST pizza I've ever had! Go close to opening (around 11:30-noon) to avoid crowds and order a classic margherita pizza - thin crust, sweet sauce, fresh mozzarella, sprinkle of fresh basil. I usually leave the crust on my plate but I absolutely loved this flavorful, salty, crispy but still soft crust.The pizza takes no time at all to cook in their coal oven (seriously - about 3 minutes), so if you beat the rush you won't be here much time at all. Definitely worth it to squeeze between other NYC attractions.If you want to visit the kitchen and see how their oven works, get a guaranteed seat in the pizzeria, and learn more about pizza in general, take Scott's Pizza Tour.

2853,Cosmo Z.,0,1,"My wife and I were in the neighborhood and decided to stop in ""America's First Pizzeria."" (They make that abundantly clear) The San Gennaro Festival was in full swing, so the mobs of tourists were also out and about. But Lombardi's seemed fairly welcoming, and the line was only 10 minutes. The host at the door seemed far more interested in texting whoever he was texting. But we shrugged it off. We were then taken downstairs to our table, in the corner, in the basement. We both laughed at how the setting was certainly not what we had expected, and a far cry from the nicer tables upstairs, with windows open and looking out to Spring Street. Downstairs, we may as well have been at the corner pizza joint you hit at 3am after a big night out. Old laminate floors, wobbly chairs, etc.TIP: Do NOT sit downstairs in the basement. It's depressing.We ordered a salad, the meatballs and a small pizza.I'm convinced the salad was made at 10am and had been sitting under clingwrap in the fridge for the past 10 hours. It was fine, but I could have made a better one with little effort at home.The meatballs were again, fine. Hardly out of this world. I've had better from the takeaway spot at Fairway.The pizza was decent. My wife and I both agreed that we preferred Patsy's or John's on Bleecker. One or two pieces of the pie lacked any cheese.Then came the shocker. Maybe we were zoned out a bit after a long day, or maybe we were thinking, 'It's a pizza joint - how expensive could it be?' ... But then the check arrived.I was stunned. 2 beers, a mediocre salad, 2 meatballs and a SMALL pizza with two toppings. $80. So after tip, more than $90! (And CASH ONLY? Either they're living in 1945, or there's a nice little tax avoidance going on here - just saying)I've lived in New York for a decade, and also lived in Tokyo and Hong Kong, so I'm used to big city prices, but this was HIGHWAY ROBBERY.Next time we're in the area, we'll find a Famous Original Ray's - get the same setting - for about $60 less.

2861,T K.,0,5,"Lombardi's has the best real brick oven pizza in NYC! The crust is thin and crisp, with a little bit of char from the coal oven. The pizza cooks in less than 2 minutes and it hot and fresh when brought to the table. They use fresh mozzarella and basil with San Marzano tomato sauce. That combination alone is worth ordering the plain Margherita. The sauce does not taste ""raw"" like at other places. The crust is also cooked through and has never been uncooked in the middle. Some favorite toppings include: olives, meatballs, roasted peppers, and the pepperoni. I'm not a huge fan of pepperoni pizza, but the pepperoni they use is small and not at all greasy, thus you don't end up with an oily mess. Order the bruschetta as an appetizer if you like tomatoes. The tomatoes have always been ripe when we've ordered this. The tomatoes are diced and tossed with olive oil and garlic; the mixture is placed on top of lightly toasted ciabatta bread. It's served as 4 pieces, so it's perfect for 2-4 people.The service has always been good, but try to avoid going during the peak lunch or dinner rush to get the best service and best cooked pizzas. There is almost always a wait, but no matter how long it is, it's definitely worth it!",10/28/2013,0,7,0,3b0o5BJQhB3G6RHI0GuWtA

(Just beware if you are vegan to deal with confused waiters/waitresses in disbelief you do not want cheese).For me, there is more reasonably priced pizza in NY and I'm happy enough with a slice from Prince Street Pizza, hitting up a less mainstream brick oven place, or making my own.

Let me also state that when we came here it was literally a few days after Hurricane Sandy so the whole place wasn't completely up and running. It was actually pitch black in that whole area and Lombardi's was surprisingly still serving pizza. There were several things not available since there was no electricity and it was freezing, but I stuck it out.We ordered a white pie and a cheese pie.The white pie was amazing! I had to stop myself from eating too much. (which didn't happen) I was a fan of how light the pizza was and of the thinner crust.I will definitely be going back to Lombardi's for the pizza and to try some other items off their menu.",3/20/2013,74,54,27,mIka47MFh6Uq6k7S0R-H8Q

Simply sauce and fresh mozzarella. Cooked in a coal oven (rare) at 900 plus degrees its thin and crispy. Very yum. Also was told to have the clam pizza.This was first on the stop of four for a pizza tour I went on. I enjoyed it but to be honest, don't think it's worth waiting forever for when there are plenty of other pizza places in New York that are just as tasty with no wait.",5/20/2012,175,770,0,uU-Rk1sj478gPh6Kug1wSw

I want an authentic thin crust and Lombardi's gives me just that. That slightly blackened, crisp, light crust   is one of the many things that make Lombardi's so good. You can only get that from a coal oven and Lombardi's has that coal oven.  Expect some crowds depending on the time you come here. Service flows pretty good and it's more roomy inside than it seems to be. This is one place everyone should try. Any time is a good time for Lombardi's!",12/8/2011,61,484,659,jEH7AHVRGE6ymr97aXmTgg

My husband and I arrived there very excited to try the pizza. We had the margherita pizza, and it was just okay. Very rarely do I have to add anything to my pizza, but I thought that the flavor was a bit lacking and felt the need to add pepper and parmesan.  They also seemed to be very skimpy on the fresh mozzarella cheese compared to other places in the city.Our bill ended up being ~$42 (before gratuity) for a large pizza and two draft beers. Overall, the service was not great. We felt as though we were inconveniencing the waitstaff by being there (and trust me, our order was about as simple as it comes).  While the service was very fast, no one was friendly or seemed to really care about our experience. We felt as though we were at a fast food pizza place and the main goal was to get our table turned over as quickly as possible (we went at an off time, so they weren't extremely busy).

It was around $19 per pizza, but to add toppings would be an extra $3 (2 toppings), or $6 (3 toppings) and the price would go on and on depending on how many toppings you order. The sausage, meatball, bacon, and pepperoni was so flavorful and so fresh. Of course, the best part is the DOUGH of the pizza. It was perfectly baked and in perfect alliance with the rest of the meats. We tried Ray's Pizza yesterday and this place was 10x better. Ray's is good for fast, drunk food pizza.

However there is better pizza in the area in my opinion.We were seated right away just a few minutes before the lunch rush arrived. It didn't take long for a small line to gather on the street.  The building is rather neat and rustic. My wife and I order a small pepperoni which is like 6 slices, enough for two people. They cook their pizzas in a coal oven if you didn't already know. This adds a little character to the pizza. The crust was thin and crispy. The sauce was good and I like the way they used sliced mozzarella. At least that's what it looked like judging by the melting pattern. Why didn't I rate this place 4 or 5? The crust was just a bit over cooked in areas given it a little too much character. The crust was also a little too crispy with some chewiness (?) where thickness was. Enough my jaw muscles got a good workout and hurt a little bit.Good pizza. Good service. A little overrated. Touristy. There is better pizza in the city. In fact there are two places very close.

Make out the invitations and call the florist, because I've found the ONE.For my NYC pizza experience, I settled on Lombardi's after reading all of the conflicting advice on which pizza is best (we invented this feud in Chicago, btw). Trip planner sent me to a super sketch subway stop, but I braved my way through the sketch to a nicer area and Lombardi's front door. The white pizza was calling my name. It is a sauce-less pizza on a thin crust with mozzarella, oregano, basil, garlic, olive oil, and pillowy dollops of ricotta on top. The pizza came out quick and the small was still huge. The ricotta -makes- this pizza. Its amazing. I made it about halfway through the pizza, and I was stuffed. However, it was so good, I abandoned my other plans for the evening and took the rest of the pizza back to my hotel with a bottle of wine. It was just too good to waste!Service was friendly and nice.

2895,Marko P.,0,1,"Once upon a time, Lombardi's earned the attention that turned it into an L.E.S. icon. Thin, crispy crusts, excellent service and acceptably over-size portions made up for the inflated prices and the cheap kitschy experience. The small menu and 'eh' table wines were forgivable.Now, it is a waste: salty, canned, cheap tomato sauce (the kind that tastes of diluted ketchup), soggy crusts, family-size salads reduced to sad single portions of chopped iceberg, absurd over-charges for added toppings and dismissive service befitting a TGIF or worse. A true tourist trap. The kitsch is getting ratty, too.Points in their favor: the prices haven't grown exponentially, and a group will still enjoy a decently inexpensive and festive meal out on the roof on a cool night. But they'll basically be eating the pizza from the place on the corner marked up about 200%.Recently, I've have much better pizza at ISA in Williamsburg and Gran Morsi in Tribeca",7/29/2015,0,2,0,nj5ol4AxmdAovBLUWNas_Q

I don't think there was anything particularly exotic or over the top about this pizza, but I can confidently say it easily beats many other pizzas I've eaten in my life.

I am not a cheap person but 77 dollars on a tab that had only one pie, one salad and five drinks?! C'mon.... Seriously ??? If the pie was awesome I would agree on that price, but it wasn't.

The wait wasn't too long thankfully the second time around. I do remember the first time coming here, although the visit was brief, I did enjoy the Margherita pizza so on a return visit, I opted to try it again. We also ended up ordering two other pies - one with mushroom, the other with pepperoni. I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I remember the first time I went, the tomato sauce did taste a little raw / had a tarty flavor, but only after going through the other three pies did I realize that the rawness / tartness was consistent, and not just a fluke from my first visit. Needless to say, I wasn't a fan of it. All the other parts of the pizza - the crust, the cheese and the toppings - were fresh and savory, so I had no complaints there. However, the sauce was just something I couldn't get over. Although this place is a decent tourist destination (first pizzeria in NYC), and they do use brick ovens, the pizza is far from the best in the city.",10/10/2012,133,137,0,wgFHsV6YPrXFaP6_Xea7tg

The place was actually bigger than I expected (I thought it would just be a basica pizzeria) and had a bit of nostalgia to it which I thought was really cool. The hostess seated us right beside a ton of NY Yankees memoribilia and autograph pictures....a HUGE PLUS for me :-) We started off with an order of bruschetta which was excellent and extremely fresh, then moved into a 14"" margherita pie to share which was more than enough. The crust was cooked to perfection and the sauce was absolutely to die for. One quick tip is to be ready to see alot of tourists at this place snapping alot of pictures.

Their toppings always taste fresh, and it kind of saddens me that I can't partake of their deliciousness anymore since I've moved back to the Bay Area.Their White Pizza is a must for fans of ricotta cheese like myself, but I'd recommend the red sauce if you prefer something that's more moist and not as outrageously cheesy. I've never really had a pizza go wrong here and I must have come here more than 15 times in the course of some two years. There will always be a wait of some sort, so anticipate that, but they do have a lot of hidden seating for what looks like a small establishment.",8/27/2010,85,376,2,bb8zWroORnHJI9SfPF0qIQ

We ordered a large with mushrooms, panchetta, and sweet Italian sausages. The first slice was good. There was a great crunch on the crust and the bottom of the pizza had this nice char from the coal ovens giving it this smokey flavor to the pizza!The second slice though, was mediocre at best. The slice was soggy!!! I blame it on the mushrooms with all that juice seeping into the crust. Such a shame.If I had a choice, I would definitely have gone with the Margherita pizza with just mozarella cheese and basil. Truely authentic Italian style pizza. Next time! I also LOVE how they use San Marzano tomatoes for their pizza sauce, which is definitely the Italian thing to do.I will of course come back to try their Margherita pizza so I can change my review :) But soggy pizza = no bueno!",3/21/2010,241,603,203,ubF5zarbyXJVMTOZrSUFyQ

Yea, it was good pizza but was it mind-blowing? Nope. I don't really know what else to say but yea they serve pizza and it was good but nothing special. As a frequent visitor to NY, I think there a lot of more interesting and delicious things to try in NY if you were visiting as a tourist.

They love the fact that it is thin-crust (while Grimaldi's isn't). I personally think it's aiite as I'm not too big of a fan of thin-crust. You can taste the burnt part of the pizza more bluntly.  The wait to get seated is typically really long (sometimes waiting for as long as an hour and half). The seating arrangement is kind of cramped as with a lot of New York places. The place is also more on the pricier side for pizza. Generally, I think this place is overrated.Tip: Bring cash as it is cash-only. There is an ATM inside however though.RatingsService - 0.5Food - 0.5Environment - 0.5Price - 0Experience - 1Overall = 2.5",11/24/2012,340,29,21,TzEBvA7Ed2Y9zV_BrMZMSA
2956,A N.,0,4,"The fiancee was dying to take me to Lombardi's since we skipped out on it during our last NYC trip.  I'm actually not the biggest fan of pizza, but I have to say - I now know what the Lombardi's hype is about.First, we were escorted through the dining area, then the kitchen, and then to a small, narrow dining area (it was really cool, I felt like we were being taken to some secret VIP area).  The atmosphere was really cozy and relaxed; people were simply there to eat pizza and have good conversation.  The part about pizza I dislike the most is the sauce.  I'm just not a tomato sauce kind of girl.  So... I ordered the ""white pizza"".  The fiancee and I split a small pizza and picked the fresh wild mushrooms and pancetta as toppings - his half was regular and my half was white (meaning no sauce).  The ""white pizza"" is a combination of mozzarella, ricotta, pecorino romano, garlic infused oil, oregano, black pepper, and basil.  Even though six slices sounds small, trust me - these are big slices.The pizza came and my half had little piles that looked like meringues - it was ricotta.  First off, I LOVE ricotta cheese, so win for me.  The pillows of ricotta combined with the saltiness of the pancetta and freshness of the mushrooms and basil was amazing and completely satisfying.While the crust is thin, I expected it to be thinner (almost paper thin).  However, I think the crust to pizza portion works okay in this case.  If the crust had been thinner, it would have been reminiscent of my times in Italy.I tried to eat all three of my slices, but could only get through two (and I forced myself through two - I was full after my first slice).  The service was okay - we asked for our check and the person never returned, so we had to ask another worker to bring us our check.  Also, no one ever came to check up on us and see how we were doing, but maybe that's the ambiance of the restaurant.I took away a star for the prices they charge.  Granted I'm not a huge pizza eater, but I think $33 for a small (14"") pizza with two toppings and a pitcher of soda before tax and tip is a little steep.I would return here if I were ever in the mood for pizza.Also - just an FYI - this place is cash only.",4/21/2013,7,10,0,-semJYHnOZfPSuWZGP0Q1A

We ordered the clam pie, which was loaded with 2 dozen clams!  Loved it!  The pizza dough was thin and crisp.  When you beat into the pie, you get a hint of seafood without it tasting fishy.  A mouthful of clams with every bite, literally!  The pie was a bit on the expensive side, but it was definitely worth it. ***TIP: Your ENTIRE group has to be present to be seated!***",10/24/2011,378,164,64,DEPMQyR48EZt_UagYjUdAQ

First, there were two hosts (male&female), at the podium, which is good...EXCEPT, they weren't welcoming or friendly. Although, I do give kudos the person who was friendly and fun was the women who walked us to our seats. Pizza was pricey, $16.50 for a margarita pizza and then $3 per additional topping. We bought two pizzas for the four of us. Fresh wild mushrooms weren't very tasty and the crust was soggy especially in the middle. The sausage and meatball were just okay tasting. I've had tastier. Given that the pizza was soggy, podium host staff were off-putting, and it is cash only, I wouldn't return nor would I really recommend it.",9/6/2012,87,176,300,11R2R4nyRpF6nqlXH-JeGQ

Lombardi's is one of those establishments that if you are walking by, you just have to pop your head in to see what all the fuss is about.

How could you not enter this pizzeria for a pie?Considering my mates and I just ate brunch we all just wanted to sample a slice, so, we ordered a large 'zah' with Rosa Grande Pepperoni and I opted for a side of anchovies. From the first bite it was hard to assess if this really was the best Pizza in NYC and possibly the best I'd ever had. As the pie cooled down, it soon became clear that this was indeed an exceptional pizza. It was seasoned perfectly, blistered crusts, scattered toppings and thin as ever. Truly a remarkable pizza...Best I'd ever had? I'd have to eat there a few more times to determine that, but definitely way up there. This is a must if you go to NYC, it's affordable, filling and in the beautiful district of Soho. A must.",10/25/2011,213,150,110,HdUpeg9oYzvzHIgeJuM2uQ

2984,Jim G.,1,4,"As so many tourists have done throughout the years I also wanted to join the great NY pizza debate.Our choice was Lombardi's since it was the first pizzeria and it had solid reviews. The wait for a table was modest considering some of the lengthy waits people have had. After a quick 15 minutes we were seated downstairs in their pseudo wine cellar. As i tried to block out the ridiculous touristy comments, ""isn't this place famous for deep dish?"" - ""can we have our pizza toppings split four ways on the pizza?"" - i made it easy for our waiter ordering a simple margherita pizza, some meatballs on the side, and a nice bottle of Chianti to wash it down with. Our waiter was pleasant and the food came out pretty quickly. The smell of the pizza with the essence of basil pushing through was promising. As I waited for it to cool a bit, so I wouldn't lose the layer of gum between my two front teeth, I dug into the meatballs. They had a nice layer of sauce on them and they were surprisingly good. Finally it was time for the pizza. The freshness of the sauce was evident with the simple yet tasty basil tomato blend. The cheese was good quality and the stiffness of the pizza held up. The disappointing part was the crust which was not impressive and the flavor just wasn't there for me. The overall experience is worth it, even with all the typical tourist trap annoyances. I really expected more from the crust and  I wanted more in the way of flavor, however this is a place I probably built up too much.

This time I tell them I write for Yelp! and I'm told they have a table ready for us. For real.. they walk us back, and back... thru the kitchen, around the corner and to our table. Our waiter. Honestly, I think he was a good waiter. I think he was a good waiter who was in over his head. We got very little attention from him. He seemed to be behind the 8 ball even with his other tables. That being said we got what we ordered in a timely fashion and if you want to put a spin on it... with very little server interruptions.Pizza... not my taste. It was good. But not the type of pizza I like. Maybe as a tourist I've gotten used to mass produced food and can't enjoy the fresh home made stuff?

2989,David L.,1,4,"The crust is crumbly and chewy, and it never gets soggy. There are definitely more delicate crusts out there, but you have to eat those immediately, otherwise they will be disgusting as leftovers, whereas Lombardi's is absolutely amazing as left overs. Not just that, they deliver -- between 14th Street and Wall Street -- and fast, never longer than 30 to 45 minutes! So if you're not in the mood for the long lines, if it's too hot out, if it's too cold out, or you just want to stay inside, you can enjoy Lombardi's without much effort. It's not cheap, but to be perfectly honest, good pizza isn't cheap, and this is good pizza. It may not be the best pizza in the city, but it's pretty damn good overall. And it's definitely better than any delivery place near me, and since they deliver to me, well, I'm a huge fan. My regular order is the Original Large Margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil) with Sautéed Garlic Spinach & Panceta -- it's fantastic every time -- and when I'm in the mood for something different, I get a Large White Pizza (mozzarella, ricotta, romano cheese) with Meatballs & Mushrooms -- it's extremely satisfying.

2991,Philip C.,0,4,"I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge with my wife to Grimaldi's for my first New York City pie. We went on a Sunday evening and waited in line for a table for at least 30 minutes. We ordered a pie with italian sausage. It had just enough sauce, which means very little, fresh mozzarella, crumbled sausage meat and fresh basil that was baked with the pie until it turned black. It was absolutely delicious. It truly lived up to the hype.On Sunday evening three weeks later, we went to Lombardi's Pizza in Little Italy for my second New York City pie. There was only one party of three ahead of us and we waited only one minute for a table. On a Lombardi's pie, compared to a Grimaldi's pie, the crust is thicker, there's more sauce, the italian sausage is cut from links, rather than crumbled sausage meat, and the basil is put on fresh at the end, rather than baked with the pie. Both crusts have plenty of salt in them.Although I prefer the fresh basil on a Lombardi's pie, I prefer everything else about a Grimaldi's pie. It's not greasy or oily. My wife blotted a slice at Lombardi's, but not at Grimaldi's. A Grimaldi's pie has the perfect amount of ingredients. You can fold a slice in half and eat it without any mess.

This isn't a by-the-slice place, after all.

2997,Karen C.,0,5,"As a kid, I despised places like Pizza Hut or Dominos and always went to local pizzerias to get a slice for $2.50 or less. Then I go to Lombardi's and I have to pay $25 for a small pie with two toppings?! I guess they kind of have a right to charge higher prices, given they're NYC's first pizzeria and all. On a Saturday night after 9pm, I had to wait about 20 minutes to get a seat for two. My boyfriend wanted italian sausage with red peppers, while I wanted meatballs with mushrooms, so we compromised and said we'd get the pizza with meatballs and peppers. Turned out they ran out of meatballs so we had to choose italian sausage in the spur of the moment (notice how he basically got his desired combination while neither of my choices made it in the pizza). I was no longer upset after receiving the pie because the roasted red peppers and sausage were so juicy and yummy with the marinara sauce. The mozzarella was fresh and the crust had that smoky, charred flavor that I love. A small pie is perfect for two people; our server said a small might be okay but if we're hungry we should get a large (so sneaky). Honestly, I probably would have still finished my portion of a large pie because the pizza was that good. The next day on the bus back to my college in middle of nowhere Maine, I kept thinking about all the wonderful food in NYC that I'll be missing out on. Lombardi's came to mind and I remembered the taste of that pizza in my mouth, and then realized that I'll be stuck with dining hall pizza or Papa John's for the next few months :(BTW, remember to bring cash.",1/5/2014,6,17,0,GdrcyXTJkkRvq_JXDMZV1Q
2998,Jana S.,0,5,"My favorite pizza of all time, really, peep my profile, it would be my last meal on earth.  I love the consistency of this pizza - always tastes the same, crispy yet doughy thin crust, fabulous sauce, delicious fresh mozzarella and basil bites.  I usually order extra basil and mozzarella because i'm cool like that.Lombardi's just started delivering, just in time for football (wooooo wee for both my bf and me as I'm more interested in the eating than the football).  CASH ONLY kids.",9/13/2012,147,185,21,RySDpRT0wC1xTkq5worldA

3000,Jess C.,0,1,"Date/Time:  Monday - 1:30pmOccasion:  LunchParty of:  TwoLocation:  Pizzeria-style.  A lot bigger than it seemsOrdered:  Margherita pizza with pancetta, pepperoni, and mushroomTotal incl gratuity: $40I hate to say it but Lombardi's was my worst NY restaurant experience during my week of culinary delight.  Definitely was not the wonderful pizza experience like many have boasted about.  Perhaps mine was an isolated incident?? But c'mon... soggy pizza and a 50 minute wait for our food wait was absolutely unacceptable!When we first perused the menu , I was a little taken aback by the prices.  You start with a standard large plain pizza of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil for $20.50 and from there can add your toppings.  Each topping was $3.00.  At three toppings, we were already at a $30.00 pizza.  My initial reaction was that I wasn't so keen on spending so much on pizza especially when there are so few toppings but was eager to try this famous Lombardis.  To my dismay, it took a whopping 50 minutes for a our food to arrive.  Fifty minutes is a substantial time to wait especially  1. when it's not like the restaurant was packed and 2. the waitress did not acknowledge us or the delay.  When our food finally arrived, the crust was soggy.  I was so disappointed.  The toppings was good however they sprinkled them on ever so sparingly.  I definitely do not recommend Lombardis.  Go elsewhere...anywhere!  Our visit to Saluggis far trumped our visit to Lombardi's in both the food and service.",10/29/2011,277,429,22,gm0V0GmBBlUlTqoZHsjWqw
3001,Eri S.,0,3,"It's probably not even worth it to review a place that has over 2000 reviews. But I'm bored so here it goes...My family came to visit and where else to take them but the first pizzeria in America? Tourists love this stuff! We came at around 1PM on Saturday. I was expecting a long wait time but surprisingly, we were seated right away in the downstairs area. There was no phone reception so...I guess we'll just have to stare at each other until our food comes. Or make conversation. Whichever.We ordered a pizza with sweet italian sausage, sauteed garlic spinach, and ricotta. It was alright. I liked the sausage and the spinach but the ricotta was overkill. But I guess we have no one else to blame but ourselves for that one. Also, I don't understand why the two tables next to us ordered a bread basket. Now, that's a lot of carbs. This place is definitely overhyped and overpriced. I'd prefer my pizza joint around the corner from my apt that I always stumble in after a night out. They feed my cookies.",7/29/2012,297,154,21,sQx0srKCXbAHnqhGhpZgvQ
3002,Alex F.,0,5,"My brother wanted to try ""real"" New York pizza so after reading that Lombardi's was America's first pizzeria, we had to try it. We happened to go on St. Paddy's but were still seated pretty quickly. Our waiter was named Paul and he was absolutely wonderful. We ordered a large original margherita pizza with pepperoni and man oh man was it incredible! The crust was soft but perfectly chewy and the big blobs of mozzarella were delicious. We managed to demolish almost the entire pizza (I had two and a half slices and my 19 year old brother scarfed four and a half, haha) and I'm sure we're going to be fighting over the leftover slice we brought home! Granted, they only accept cash and $25+ for a pizza may sound a little steep, especially when they don't sell by the slice, but it was definitely worth it; I studied abroad in Rome but Lombardi's probably still falls in my top three best pizzas!",3/18/2015,119,8,0,PZfIFEn5Pup-wgPJ-JSrFQ

First off: they gotta take off that banner that reads outside: ""Zagat* rated Best Pizza in the Universe!"" Or World. Or Planet. Or whatever the hell the gargantuan claim reads. I mean, OBVI you KNOW going in that nothing can be THAT good. But still. It gets your expectations waaaay up. And what's inside is... well... truthfully, deserving of 2 Stars, but I""m going hard on them due to that stupid braggart brandishing bla bla sign outside. So there! *Does anyone read Zagat anymore anyways? Isn't that sooo 1993? I'm confused.Walking through the kitchen - if you are seated in the back area, is cool. I'm like: Wassup with that Brother machine right there? Is that a PRINTER!? Next to the coal oven from which my mediocre pizza roasts!? Got home and there was black dusk all over my face... and no, I wasn't tripping. It was just a basic margarita pizza. Not enough cheese, not enough - ok, not really ANY basil (it was shriveled and so tiny that it's best described as a DEARTH) and the sauce was... sorta on the thin, sour side. Think Ragu sauce - not Prego! Not that it's either, but flavor profilewise. Yikes! Still... it's a family joint... and I imagine, you could get some good pizza. If you got creative with your toppings. And, after all, this is Little Italy! There's TONS of shitty restaurants posing around all this pseudo glamour. It's a veritable tourist trap amongst these parts and any NYer would be hard pressed to find a good bang for his buck and something worth writing yelp about. Used to order this pizza all the time after long coke benders while living in my ex-boyfriend Paul's loft on Broome and Broadway. Paul? Are you there? Miss you, buddy. (I dumped him.) (FOR my nutty professor!) We'd wake up all hung over sneezing at like 3:30 and the sun would be going down and I'd just pack a bowl and pop a beer and turn on the TV, (the PLASMA - back when no one owned them and everyone spied into each others lofts using TELESCOPES)  something cool would be on as always, like Blade Runner or the Fifth Element. It's fun to cuddle with your boyfriend on a Saturday! 19 and not a care in the world. Except, that, you know what he knows which is you both know it's totally temporary - that, with him going around introducing your age as part of your identity (""She's NINEteen""). Traders. Ugh. So Jersey! Meatheads. Do you know that the country's richest fuckers are also sorta the trashiest? But not you Paul: you were the best. I regret leaving you for my nutty professor and any day now I'd consider - briefly - taking you back. But only if you have all new friends! Except Mohammad, he was the bomb. What up, Mohammad! We're still friends on Facebook. So last night coming back from a very thought provoking dialogue at IDP on Bowery on Tibet's Time Machine: The Science of Civilized Happiness / Kalachakra Tantra - I wanted to take Melissa to Lovely Day but somehow, blame it on the rain, we both got side-tracked by PIZZA. MMMMM PIZZA, we thought. Then I reminisced. I thought of great Paul: White Mountain, Full of Money (Up our Noses) and how we'd just roll out of bed and order this pizza before rolling back into bed and passing out again around 7pm. See, THAT was when I had no sense of smell, or taste. The crust of these pies is ok  - so dusty it'll get all over your face though. And if you're not getting paid for it, then..... nevermind. OH!!! NOW I REMEMBER!!! POMODOROS! Thats where we liked the GOOD pizza. THAT'S where the GOOD pizza came from. Still, I'd hit up Lombardi's again - but only if someone else was paying for it! And this time, load on the toppings. And invite my big extended family. It's that kinda joint. Oh and ... one more thing... please don't punish us by giving us WARM tap water :( :(:( :( :( :( I mean really. C'mon.",8/20/2007Previous review,303,311,43,tSKGejZuR8E7OGLckX4-8Q

Thanks a lot Lombardi's for completely ruining pizza for me for the rest of my life. No I wouldn't expect to be totally full and yes, the pizzas are expensive but you won't get a better quality pizza anywhere else in the world. You can't convince me otherwise.My recommendation is to get a pizza half red/half white (if you like Ricotta - they put a ton). You don't need all the other toppings and they can get a little expensive (although they are great). If you need to do anything, get a side of their awesome meatballs.If anything, I'd deduct them a star since I've been calling for 4 years ordering the same pizza, with the same name/apartment/phone # and they still don't recognize me.

That's all fine and dandy, how does it taste?We had a family BBQ on Sunday in Westchester and I knew I was going to swing thru the city Sunday night to little Italy. Lombardi's menu is very simple, pizza with toppings, beer and wine and about (5) appetizer choices. That's it, no dessert. (I had that covered a few blocks away)We ordered the brushetta that was kind of soggy from the tomatoes. I ordered a cream beer which was pretty good and a 1/2 sausage large pizza. The pizza was cooked perfect, not too much charr along with their signature sweet sauce.

Shouldn't have had time to learn to make the pizza a bit better?

Anyways after the long ass wait the pizza comes reasonably fast and their meatballs are super legit. If you go I'd ask for 3 toppings but have them all be meatball so you get more. Trust me it'll be worth it.On an annoying note the whole damn place has a hot two bathrooms and one was being occupied by a waitress who had just gotten to work and was changing for a whole damn 15 minutes.

The restaurant is a lot larger than it seems from outside and once seated, you don't feel cramped, though there are frazzled waitstaff and busboys running up and down while you eat.We ordered a large pizza ($23 and $3 for each topping) with tomatoes, mushrooms and onions. They have a few drinks on tap and regular varieties of soda. So there wasn't anything unusual or trendy on the menu, and the ambiance is very family-oriented. The service was very efficient and warm from the hosts to the waiter to the busboys. Everyone seemed content in their job and the feeling resonated throughout our experience.

You can say you don't like the style, but if you like moderately thin but not crispy crust traditional pizza Lombardi's is topnotch. I lived in Chicago for ten years and had great pizza there, and in New Haven which all also produces excellent pies. Lombardi's has its own style and it is tops in its category. I don't expect ambiance in a pizzeria, so I didn't take points off for this. The atmosphere is factory-like and they obviously want to turn the tables quickly.

A fresh mozzarella pie with barely any cheese, at $28 you have to be kidding me!?!Tried my first Lombardi's pie with meatball and roasted red peppers... similar to the cheese, it was hard to find a bite with either.

However, at Lombardi's on Sunday, I saw something I've never seen in all my pizza-eating years. It was something I'd never even considered the possibility of, and quite honestly, it frightened me. I was shaken to the core. During a leisurely dinner with some out-of-town friends, I glanced over at one of them, and saw that she had folded her pizza. Everyone folds their pizza, I know. But she had taken the tip of the slice, and folded it up towards the crust. She folded it FROM TIP TO CRUST, and took a bite out of the middle. The sheer impracticality of it boggles the mind.  ""Are you seeing this?"" I asked one friend.He nodded, ""It's offensive.""I stood up, pointed at her and yelled to the room, ""Has anyone EVER seen this?"" Predictably, no one paid any attention to me. Everyone just went on living their lives, as if they thought I was taking a mildly unusual personal decision and blowing it way out of proportion.*Based on the company this girl keeps,** her judgment was already in question; this lunacy pushed her over the edge. She's completely lost all semblance of credibility. If you're reading this K, Don't worry. I'm talking about the other girl who folded her pizza tip to crust. OH WAIT. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE EVER.***In any case, Lombardi's makes a good pie.**** I would prefer not to wait for over an hour before they could seat our party of six, and I prefer my crust just a bit thinner; however, the ingredients are fresh, and once you're eating it, you're not going to be unhappy.________*Hmm.**Me and my friends.***The whole situation reminded me of this: whoppervirgins.com.

The ingredients are fresh and whatever kinda marinara they had on the margherita it was sensational. Wish they had chicken as a topping though. Sadly they don't and hence negative the star from what was really a supremely good pizza.,12/19/2014,61,26,40,lDH8SPaBSrg8-hmbu9q6qg

Came here on Sunday night after watching Lion King on Broadway and there was no wait at all! We got a Bruchetta, a Medium Margherita Pizza, a Large Pizza with 3 toppings (Sausage, mushrooms, Spinach), and a pitcher of Blue Moon. Personally I really liked the Margherita pizza, but would have preferred Grimaldis Pizza over the Large pizza.Overall, this place has my heart just because it reminds me of the amazing pizza I had while living in Italy!",11/2/2011,504,88,33,YM5Apb-nIkU3n5Hy67SUpQ

Really? I'm with Lizz K. on this one -- I just don't get it. Nowadays, it's easy to find good pizza.The thin crust is too thick and also too bland (along with the sauce). I ordered a small sausage and wild mushroom pizza. I don't know what was wild about the ubiquitous ordinary white button mushroom that you find in any grocery store, unless they were gang banging mushrooms. The pizza was delivered to my table soggy.The raspberry Italian soda was watered down and the soda water was already half flat. I had the privilege of paying $33 for this terrible meal.

3060,Jeffrey C.,0,5,"So my friend (who just went to NY the week before me) said if I wanted NY pizza, I had to go to Lombardi's to get truly authentic pizza. With that in mind, and having a big group with small wallets with me, we set off for the ""first pizza of America"" (so they say). Upon arrival, I realized that I had been here before on one of my prior NY excursions (hey what can I say, I was just a follower back then, not a leader). At that point, I knew I was getting myself into something good.Let's just say I'm a lover of tomato sauce. And while I love NY thin-crust pizza, a common problem I run into is the lack of said sauce at the expense of extra cheese. Now let's just say that Lombardi's in no way has this problem. We got two larges, one standard margherita and one with meats. Besides not featuring nearly enough basil, Lombardi's margherita pizza sets some kind of standard. Its plentiful with the sauce, has delicious slides of cheese, and is the perfectly thin and crispy. My advice: don't even get any toppings; it just compromises the absolutely wonderful taste.Added bonuses: the pitcher of Coke cut down somewhat on costs; even on a Saturday night, we were seated right away and received our pizzas within 15 minutes of ordering; the super-nice waitress who accommodated our loud noises and picture taking. Only downside is cash only, which can be a problem if you're a large group and ill-prepared. Luckily, we had just enough.",8/12/2009,598,1026,926,skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg
3061,Eric N.,0,5,"Amazing, authentic New York style Pizza.  Be sure to get toppings on your pizza otherwise the Pizza just tastes rather bitter b/c it would just be pure tomato sauce with cheese.",10/24/2014,285,55,6,DpKQ_bfGmG4FaIu7gjM1QA
3062,Atif I.,1,3,"After being told that he looked cool, Yogi Berra famously responded with: Thanks, you don't look so hot yourself! In the same way, Lombardi's may be cool enough not to warrant a review of ""Tourist Trap"", but on current form it would reflect poorly on the judgment of a reviewer to place it in the league of the best pizzerias in the city.The website says firstpizza, and that indeed is an accurate claim, no matter what you hear from the residents of a college town an hour and forty minutes from New York City. New Havenites might have SAT scores in excess of 2200, but apparently the simple fact that 1905 predates 1925 is beyond their comprehension! So let me repeat: by virtue of being licensed in 1905, Lombardi's is America's first pizzeria and every famous pizza place to follow it: John's, Patsy's, Totonno's - owes its founder, Genaro, a debt of gratitude. Sadly, Lombardi's has seen better days. While it manages the influx of the tourist mobs with efficiency, the culinary magic has dipped considerably in the past five years, or so. I have tried many different kinds of pizza here: Margherita, Clam, and some even with toppings (which I lately avoid), and they've all been unremarkable. Starting from the toppings, I don't think one could say anything positive about their flavor or even freshness. With the exception of garlic, that does its best to liven up the famed clam pie, there is little to boast about.The Margherita pie had excellent, fresh and creamy mozzarella, but that was the highlight of the meal. The sauce was both inadequate AND bland, clearly their weakest link. There was no hint of any spice, and the contrast with Grimaldi's is like day and night. Thanks to the coal oven, the crust has a nice char at the bottom, but I found the edges to be dry and white, and the interior thicker than that at Grimaldi's. And, as the economy needs to be stimulated, I will pitch in and do my bit to encourage tourists to pay Lombardi's a visit. Here's my advice: if you either don't know that NYC has better pizza, or constrained by your needs to shop in Soho, don't have the time and energy to search or wait for it - Lombardi's is an excellent option. Do try their Tourist Special - where they cut the pizza in four pieces, because after all that travel you're not hungry enough to eat six! :D",10/30/2008,178,642,1789,cD_hpkvErXCyQHBQzv8KYQ

I was looking forward to the sweetness of the sauce; I was looking forward to the crisp, yet chewing nutty, crust intermingling with the sauce and cheese resting atop;  I was looking forward to tasting the smokiness of the charred end crust while finishing off my vanilla soda.  BUT, I was disappointed. The sauce was too salty for my taste; the crust thin and cracker-like; the cheese was ok but by my second slice it was cold and stiff; I ordered a vanilla soda to go with, didn't know what to expect but when the server came to the table with a  tall fountain glass mostly filled with whipped cream, topped with cherry i was intrigued. Then there was the ice and lots of it. I enjoyed it but, the actual soda was gone within 3-4 pulls on the straw. But there was still PLENTY of whipped cream left. The Place is old school Italian restaurant style. It's cozy. But there is lots of seating once you get inside. The staff looks to be well coordinated; all on walkie talkies. This is a tourist spot.

The opportunity finally presented itself as we were in the area.We sat down immediately and ordered our traditional favorite Pepperoni Pizza with a pitcher of Root Beer. The waitress brought our pitcher within a minute. We poured a glass and started a conversation. Amazingly within the next 5 minutes she had brought out our Pizza pipping hot.  I had never in my life ordered a pizza and had it served in such a short period of time.   The pizza was thin and crispy with a couple of large air bubbles on the crust.

3081,TJ R.,1,2,"In life everything must change. It just sucks that Lombardi's had to. I have been going to Lombardi's off and on for 11 years.Less frequently recently, and now I'm not sure I will be returning.When I first started going to Lombardi's it was a hole in the wall place between the corner bar, and a little Italian coffee/dessert spot. Now Lombardi's has taken over both spots, good for them, business is good they need more room.Then: Pizza was soggy with sauce, Pepperoni was chunky (like no ones business). Pizza was hot, yummy and ""perfect"" (seemingly)Middle: Still soggy (I like sauce, not toooo much, but I don't want dry-mouthedness from pizza). Cheese had changed, quality wasn't the same. Pepperoni was chunky as ever, still enjoyable.Middle-now: Frequented less often (because of this that and the other thing, can't talk about it, not the pizzas fault)Now: Went with friends who have enjoyed the Pizza in the past, well they were talking about how it was good but Totono's in Brooklyn (not the shit ones in Manhattan) was actually better, having had that only once, I couldn't compare. Comparing to past experiences (hence this review) I am sorely disappointed in the pizza I consumed. Still thin as ever, but so verrrry dry, and the pepperoni went on a carb-diet and lost it butt. (She ain't chunky no more)The sauce still has flavor, but there wasn't enough (not extra, I mean enough) to be enjoyable.I have tried the newer Artichoke pizza on 14th street, that was good but not as good as Lombardi's use to be, but Artichoke has the sauce amount right.This part is not a joke: I use to be able to sit down and enjoy an entire large Pepperoni pie, now I'd only do it on a dare, cause it just ain't that good.Moral of the story: Once your favorite place of old learns how to be more commercial, and cut cost, start looking for another hole in the wall that keeps it real.Peace",12/31/2008,223,168,822,_LhVNExLlF0gLxM1CsS7uQ

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE thin crust pizza. But for some reason, I felt the pizza here was too soggy for my liking. The toppings weren't anything special and the flavors were nothing out of the ordinary. Couldn't really taste the basil or sun-dried tomatos either.

An apathetic waitress showed up and took our order for an overpriced pitcher of beer. We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and and a white pizza.The pies came out in short order. First thing I noticed, and I'd read about this, was that the crust has almost no flavor. It also had no chew or really any texture at all beyond that of hard bread. The sauce was the best part, but no better than I've made myself. The mozzarella was very good, but again, you can buy good mozz for less. The white pie was the same same way as far as bread and cheese, and was disappointingly greasy. The total for all that came out to about $70 with tax and tip.

3085,Ken C.,0,3,"In Manhattan I've noticed that if you talk pizza, the four names that come up are Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Artichoke Pizza, and John's.  Lombardi's is the first pizza place in the country.  It was established in 1905 and, that alone, makes this place worth trying.   Today, we ordered a margherita pizza and a pizza with sausage, mushroom, and pancetta.  In our trip to NYC, this was my third pizza place.  My favorite of the bunch was Grimaldi's and my least favorite was Lombardi's.While I absolutely love the historical value of the place, I felt like it was unremarkable.  Grimaldi's had more flavor, a better crust, and fresher ingredients, so, unfortunately, Lombardi's can't compare.   On our pizza with ingredients, I even noticed that the pizza got a little soggy on some parts.Regardless of some of the drawbacks, I'm ultimately glad that I was able to try this place due to its historical value.  You could totally try it for yourself, but if you're looking for the best pizza in town -  nein...this isn't it.",7/13/2011,674,604,451,0hMC8tPtc_K_ACAj7pss_Q
3086,Ray B.,0,5,Still love coming to this place. It's in the heart of Little Italy. I have not been here in a few years and wanted to come back again. The pizza is awesome as the last time. The pies are a little pricey at $19.99 for small but it's well worth it. The cheese was amazingly delicious and I love the sauce. Sauce was fresh and the pepperoni was excellent. Nice restaurant to just relax. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is very friendly. I recommend anyone to try this place instead of waiting in line at Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge. I know Lombardi's is where I will come every time come to New York. Just remember to bring cash as they don't take credit cards. ATMs are around the restaurant in case you need cash.,6/6/2014,97,273,221,05N0X8nEHfoSn7t21MyPsg
3087,Lindsay W.,0,4,"My uncle-in-law took us here because he claimed it was his favorite, most authentic pizza in New York. I dare say that he's right, and it seems many others agree with him! The place wasn't too packed while we were in there, we got a seat at a booth immediately, but right after us there seemed to be a rush.We ordered a pepperoni pizza to split. I liked how small the pepperoni's were, which cut down on the grease factor, and the sweet tanginess of the bright red sauce was superb. I liked how the cheese wasn't slathered all over the whole slice, but formed little islands for the sauce to peek through. I'm sure that there are many definitions of authentic NYC pizza, but this certainly seemed authentic. The crust was excellent - thin, a little chewy, with a dusting of light flour that I loved. They are fine with you taking to-go boxes. Pretty good service.Only downside: seems to be a bit touristy. But there's a reason it's popular!",7/21/2012,143,200,267,kPaqBMv4mU-N80Fzd8vU3A

I've lived in many places including Korea, Maryland, Boston now in LA and visited numerous pizza restaurants but nothing really satisfied my appetite until my friend brought us to this place during my visit to NY. True east coast style. Their margherita pizza had enough cheese and thin crust baked at the perfect temperature. It got me hooked at the first bite and 3 of us ordered twp mediums to devour and order another one to go. Even though the wait was nearly an hr, it was definitely worth the time. The owner was there and I took picture with him. When I go back to NY, I will definitely go to this place again. Two thumbs up",8/29/2012,15,136,8,bt5-T5WyFR8kzi1rOm-QkA

White pizza happens to be both of our favorite type of pizza, and i think there were approximately 7 words said between the two of us while devouring the pie -- it was THAT good. he may have cried tears of joy, but don't tell him i told you that.all in all, excellent pizza, lots of history, cute atmosphere -- if you don't mind a short wait (i can't say what the wait is like during peak times, like dinner rush, but i imagine it wouldn't be terrible, they seem to turn over tables fairly quickly).",6/21/2010,101,163,16,VJZPJjgZpO7Slo3_zWtsAg

3095,William K.,0,4,"Little Italy at its best.  I had very high expectations for this place based on the Zagat reviews combined with over 1000 Yelp reviews. I visited Lombardi's on a Saturday evening, it was very easy to find by taking the 6 train to Spring Street. The wait was about 45 minutes for a table for 2 but the place has a high turnover so people are continuously coming and going. As for the pizza, it was out of this world. I ordered the classic small pie (perfect for 2 people) with extra mozzarella. It came out hot and fresh from the oven in less than 20 mins. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars was because I told the waitress to make the crust medium so it wouldn't be too tough. It came out well done but it didn't really affect the taste. Two other things to mention, 1- no free refills on fountain drinks which I think is ridiculous.  2- You can only pay with cash.  One other thing, I went to Italy last summer and the pizza there was not nearly as good Lombardi's..no joke!",6/1/2010,43,146,310,_7GCNF9nw0nFHTpa8RQgpA

3098,Jaime M.,0,3,"Wait is ridiculous, staff is unpleasant, pizza's overpriced, location is semi-shady (at least after dark -- I got pickpocketed!), and they only sell by the whole pie. After 40 minutes outside in the drizzle, leaning under a narrow awning, I was clinging to the hope that my two (three?) friends from home knew what they were talking about when they recommended this place. The pie itself was picture-perfect, and tasty to boot. The crust, though, was overly tough, with the only flavor coming from the residual essence of the oven itself, which apparently is legendary (just read the plaque outside). I don't know if it was overworked or the formula was off, but I wasn't thrilled.The tomato sauce was killer, light but not juicy, and the cheese was absolutely the freshest mozzarella. The THREE *slivers* of fresh basil on the whole pie were too skimpy to count for anything. The only thing saving this from being a one-star experience is the taste of the pizza, which was one crust short of awesome. I guess being a party of one meant it was safe to assume I had leprosy, though, despite having a dollar worth just as much as the next couple's.Bring friends, eat it there and split the bill.

We decided on a margherita pizza with sausage, onions and peppers. The waiter asks if we want roasted red peppers or spicy green peppers. I ask if they are green bell peppers and he said, yeah the spicy ones. Needless to say they were jalapeño peppers...sliced in half.

I love mushrooms, but for some reason mushrooms on pizza is not something I care for, I keep trying it expecting something better, maybe my expectations are too high.My favorite of the 3 flavors was the meatball toppings.  First and foremost, I never knew a Meatball topping existed so meatballs and pizzas?!...#MINDBLOWN!  Of the different flavors of pizza I got, I would definitely recommend getting meatball as a topping.The pizza came out quickly, which is a plus, and it also didn't burn the crap out of my mouth when I first bit into it, a HUGE plus for me.  My only gripe was that I felt very cramped in the booth I was sitting in.  The table didn't have much space (hardly enough for one large pizza and one small pizza).  The overall ambiance was nice and my friends and I were able to have a nice conversation, but after the pizza arrived the it took up the whole table and it was difficult to communicate with a huge pizza in front of you.  This could be good or bad...so let's say it's neutral.I'd definitely come back FYI CASH ONLY!",7/9/2012,159,113,30,JSObKmOOAT0xlAkdmaKIiw

3124,Franklin A.,0,4,"Lombardi's is a classic and supposed to be the oldest still operating pizzeria in America so it is a MUST stop for any visit in New York.  It's nothing fancy.  No bells and whistles.  No happy birthday singing, meal deals, or 1001 different crazy toppings.  It's great pizza done right.  Simple and tasty and it leaves you wanting more.  This last visit it just so happened that it was our anniversary and this was where my wife wanted to go.  We had a LARGE margarita pizza and it was delicious.  Light and crispy!  We managed to finish the whole thing off (last time we got a small) but we justified our pigginess with a) it was our anniversary, and b) we had just walked around Liberty and Ellis Islands for about 7 hours.  The best thing about it, besides the fresh flavor and pizza goodness, is that it wasn't greasy.  We didn't feel slimy or gross like you sometimes can when you get pizza.  I'm not sure what their trick is but it's obvious that they've perfected it.In the interest of full disclosure, I am a thin crust kind of guy.  I've had deep dish and I appreciate the existence of deep dish and can understand why people like deep dish.  However, if I'm going to have a choice between a great slice of thin crush NY style pizza and deep dish...I'll choose thin crust every single time.  They have only three kinds of pizza here but I highly recommend the margarita - its what we've had the past couple of times we've visited.",1/14/2014,40,127,57,hW_HLHqc4N59mYnV7oq9ww

3129,Virginia Y.,0,3,"Note: This review is based on take out only.Okay so i don't know why but I don't think Lombardi's pizza lives up to its hype.. My friends and I got a small 14inch pie with 6 slices, it was the original so it came with tomato sauce. We added three toppings, roasted peppers, italian sausage and mushrooms. It came out to be roughly 30 bucks. It took 15 minutes to make, pretty fast for a whole pie. Anywhoo, while eating it on my drive back home, I realized how cheesy it was and how much it lacked tomato sauce.. not only that it was a bit too greasy for my taste. Honestly, it tastes like any other average pizza place, just the crust is thicker and the cheese is more and the toppings are freshier. In other words, my friend said she could probably get the same quality at Papa John's. Ouch... Overhyped and overpriced.

So, on a recent visit to NYC, I finally made it to this pizza landmark and I'm glad I did.I went for dinner on a Sunday night with four other people. Surprisingly, we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Not bad. We ordered two pizzas: one classic (margharita) and one with mushrooms, pepperoni, and red onions. Both were delicious: perfect thin crust with an excellent sauce to cheese ratio.I'm a fan of pretty much all NYC pizza, but Lombardi's was certainly a cut above most places.

3140,Patty T.,0,4,If you are looking for a quality pizza place around this area.. this is your place.  Little Italy is filled with tourist traps and this maybe one of them.  But the food is actually good.  Where else are you going to get authentic NY pizza (thin crust) pizza?    Plus the beer selection is delicious. Only complaint I have is because the pizza is so thin if you don't eat it fast enough the center kind of gets soggy :(Hint: if you are going for lunch get there at 12 and there is always a spot.,12/24/2011,131,284,6,GMcod9mXZ48OUwHV4FusWA

Once you get past the tourist and the cheestastic atmosphere outside, you enter a huge place. All of the fresh classic pizza toppings are on the menu but what makes it for me are premium toppings such as pancetta and wild mushrooms.

I got their regular pizza with Italian sausage.  The sausage was good, the crust was good, the edges of the crust were a bit rougher than I would have wanted, but still good.  The toppings were good.  The price was a bit much, but the ingredients were clearly of a higher quality.  I didn't finish the pizza that day (thank God) and I had some the next day.  The next day was a completely different situation.  This pizza does not microwave well.  It is not good the next day.  I think everything else has already been said about it.",12/2/2008,753,2088,21,MurRkRS5aYaa1IfaRY20_Q
3143,Phil L.,0,3,"Alright, so I tried going here one morning before they were open but was way too hungry to wait around.  I finally made my way around to this place when I was downtown today and I must say the pizza is good and bad at the same time.  The Good:  The pizza's crust, sauce, and cheese.  The crust is perfection, very nice and chewy, a great crispness from their coal fired oven, and it's thin like a New York style pizza should be but has the durability to hold up to the toppings you put on there.  The worst thing I hate is when I pick up a slice and the structural integrity is so poor that my cheese and toppings fall onto my plate!  The cheese, nice high quality mozzarella being used here as you can tell by how stringy it gets.  The downside, is if you're like me who likes a lot of cheese on pizza, this isn't it.  It's more like the original Italian style where there is more sauce than there is cheese.  Finally, the sauce, a nice acidity to it with great flavor.The Bad:  Toppings, toppings, toppings!  Oh, and price.  The toppings here sucked.  Italian sausage and meatball were the blandest most boring things I've had on my pizza.  Honest to god, I swear a Domino's Pizza has better sausage than the crap they tried to pass off here.  I would have been happier had I walked to my local Key Foods and bought their hot Italian sausage and placed it on my pizza with Ikea Swedish meatballs, seriously.  The foundation of the pizza is excellent, but the toppings are the downfall of  this place.  Besides that, for a small pizza and a soda the bill was $26.00, way too pricey for what it is.  I guess they can bank on the reputation to charge that kind of price.",9/29/2011,167,876,249,7eFy-LxZuvS2K6PAQoibBA

I recommend going here.  Better than a lot of pizza places.  Be aware, if you like really cheesy pizza, this is more a margherita with the little globs of mozzarella on it.  Can be on the dry side a bit too.  Thin crust.The service isn't that great.  The place is an old pizza parlor.  You won't come here for decor or service, just the good pizza.   We ordered an original margherita and a sausage pizza. Sausage came out and then had to wait a while for the margherita.  The one without the toppings that is the same thing took longer?  So some of us had to wait to eat since we don't eat sausage.  Besides all that, the pizza was tasty and hot.  Being as its NYC, tables are small so not a lot of room given you're ordering pizzas.  What can you do?  Eat fast to make room!We took home almost a whole pie of leftover pizza. We were hungry when we ordered but 2 large were too much for 4 of us.  This pizza does not reheat or keep well.

The only good thing was the fresh mozzerella. My dad, a NY pizza fanatic actually had to complain about the sauce. Or was it paste they used?I wouldn't even give it one star.The reason it is getting two is because after an event downtown they served margarita pizza. It was good, nothing great with lots of fresh basil. I asked where it was from and they said Lombardi's - so this was much better than what I had while dining there.  Perhaps again it is too much inconsistency.

3152,Rachel A.,1,4,"Just like Grimaldi's but better. Maybe Patsy's is 5 stars?I think I liked Lombardi's because of the overall experience. It was much less grimm and dead than Grimaldi's in Hoboken. As a tourist spot, I was expecting a long wait but we strolled right in. There's actually two rooms here and it was much larger than I thought it was. And they really pack in as many people as they can. Lombardi's is not a good place for groups. Four does not fit comfortably in a booth. The pizzas alone take up half of your table. It was amazing no one at my table burned themselves or spilled any drinks. We got two pies. One classic tomato and basil and one clam pie. Both were good but I liked the tomato and basil better. Simple but full of flavor. The clam pie had loads of huge clams on it. Chewy, it was the meat of the sea, but lacking in flavor it was. My crew squeezed lemon on theirs but I abstained. The pie needed some olive oil or some more sauce. It was a little dry. But switching between the two pizzas made it okay. Two small pizzas were the perfect order for 4 people. The crust at Lombardi's is really good. It's chewy and I love the dusted flour on the dough. Also, after eating the pizza, none of us felt sick or overly full. This was probably the first time any of us have eaten pizza without it being overkill. The pizza at Lombardi's is light. The sauce isn't even acidic. I'd like to try the eggplant parmigiana pizza next time.Now about the restaurant being small, hopefully you're a small person if you need to go to the loo. The bathroom at Lombardi's must have been a makeshift bathroom. You've got to maneuver yourself on the can because there is a huge fat pole that sits right in the area of where your legs should be. This bathroom is for those who are either highly experienced or for those who just really need to go. All others can focus on the pizza. :)*************************************************************************Edit: 3/16/08The meatballs are really good here. Homemade, soft and seasoned. They may weigh down your pizza but they are deeeeeee-licious! You can even get a side of meatballs. The meatballs at Lombardi's remind me of the book ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" by Judi Barrett.

3153,Liz M.,1,3,"You know, before reviewing this place I looked at other reviews and was intrigued. Yelp reviews are interesting because one person will give a place 2 or 3 stars and then someone else will give the place 5 stars and go bananas. Being that we all have different likes and dislikes, I guess no one place can be 5 stars 100% of the time. On that note, I will review true, authentic, New York pizza.Ok, three stars from me. From a place that claims to be the first pizzeria in America, I expected to want to fly to NY every other weekend just to eat pizza here. If that had been true they would have gotten 5 stars. We didn't get a pizza with tons of toppings because we wanted to enjoy what the pizza actually tasted like. It was thin crust and very, very fresh tasting. And that's all I really have to say about it. It was really yummy. But you know what my conclusion is? I'm a California girl. A Bay Area girl at that. And I'm used to my pizza being covered in just about every item in the pantry. LM told me that I like my pizza's ""all Californian"". He's from Maryland. I know that you real pizza aficionado's would kick me in my face and tell me that I don't know a real pizza. Well, I had Lombardi's and now I know ""real pizza"". It was very good but it wasn't my idea of ""off the hook, off the chain, off the heez...."" etc. Give me a slice with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, feta cheese, spinach, chicken, stuff like that and you may get 5 stars from me.

3161,Danny K.,0,4,"I checked out Lombardi's on a Saturday for lunch.  This place was packed - fortunately there were only 2 of us so we were able to get a table in less then an hour.  This restaurant is surprisingly big compared to what you see from the outside.  Fortunately we were seated in the basement - less noise and much more ""cozier"" then the upstairs - upstairs has huge windows open to the front allowing all the folks waiting to be seated to stare at you while you dine - I was one of the ""creeper's"" staring while waiting =) Plus you have to deal with the host and his loud speaker yelling out peoples names to be seated.  The place is decked out like what you would expect from a typical New York pizzeria - tons of pictures from local neighborhoods, pix of restaurant founders, brick walls, and dim lighting.    The pizza was definitely above average.  Personally, I like thin crust pizza over the thick Chicago style.  The two of us polished off a small pizza with sautéed garlic, spinach, Italian sausage, and mushrooms.  They don't have any ""special"" toppings - just the usual stuff (a fairly small menu).   Even with the basic toppings their pizza is cooked to perfection - slightly burned crust and very thin all the way around.  The toppings were fresh and hearty.  Since this is the only pizzeria I've been to in New York I'm not sure if there are any better one's out in the area.  However, I did notice about 90% (if not more) of the people eating here were tourists (including me).  Maybe it's the extremely high Yelp reviews that draw people here (this is definitely one of the reasons I visited).  I think next time I'm out in the area I'm going to seek a more local place where all the native New Yorkan's go to grub on some thing crust pizza!",10/15/2011,186,285,62,1K7eMLRCaefGcCmPSsHg0Q

On the plus side, service was relatively quick! In and out of there in about 40 minutes!I ordered the raspberry Italian soda and it was gooood, not too sweet at all and the flavor wasn't overwhelming so that's a plus!For the pizza, we ordered a small, half original half white with pancetta every where. A small contains 6 slices and we were able to finish 5/6 for two small girls and still get dessert elsewhere! The white had a bit too much cheese in certain areas for me but it was still good for the experience. The original was superb though, the sauce on it however does make the thin pizza slightly soggy but I prefer my pizza that way vs it being crispy.It was a good experience for first timers in New York but it didn't blow my mind away like I thought it would.

3166,Dan N.,1,4,"The pizza here is perfection.. but the long waits can be discouraging. If you have a group size of 8 you can make a reservation. I highly recommend you do so if you plan to go there with a group that large. Large size is perfect for 3 people or for 2 with take home. In house pizza is way better than if you order it to go. Pepperoni, meatball, sausage, mushroom, and peppers are my favorite toppings there. Delicious sauce and cheese on each pie. This place does NOT accept anything but cash.. they do have an ATM on the premises, but it's best to come prepared. The best time to go to Lombardis is Mon-Thurs when there is typically no crowd at all for dinner. It's also a great place to stop by for lunch.. and you can get some pinkberry after :)",8/31/2008,403,639,251,eLHsnsI2YDuGwIdFqYFhnA
3167,Debora L.,1,4,"I've been here twice now and although I'm not a huge fan of pizza in general, Lombardi's definitely makes the cut of ""memorable pizza places in NY"". They're very confident about teh quality of the pizza-- it's *permanently painted* on the awning outside the restaurant-- and it's all right. The crust is almost razor thin since it's NY style, and the ingredients are all very fresh. The tomato sauce is just right-- not too much or little, not too flavorful or bland...I've had the sausage, pepperoni, spinach+garlic, fresh basil, and mushrooms here. All excellent. I recommend them all.Portions: A large pizza fed 3 petite Asian girls pretty well (I believe that was 8 large slices), and a large + medium fed 2 Asian girls and 2 guys with large appetites pretty well also. Expect to wait. For a party of 3 on a Saturday night around 7pm, we waited around 40 minutes. For a party of 4 on a weeknight, we waited about 40 min to 1 hour as well. They don't take reservations.Also, the tables are pretty small so expect to get up close and personal with your dining party.Warning: the bathrooms are tiny tiny tiny! I'm 5'2"" and I had to sit sidesaddle on the john. I've never had to sit sidesaddle while peeing before.Anyway, if you're eating in NY and want some authentic pizza, you gotta check out Lombardi's, if nothing else for the experience. Or go walk the Brooklyn Bridge and head to Grimaldi's.... :)",9/5/2008,202,854,172,7Xpb51viDdOaV_89olxp5w

God.New York pizza this, New York pizza that.  All I ever hear about is how much California pizza sucks.  First day in New York, a friend took us to Ray's, and I didn't get they hype.  Then we went to Lombardi's.  And let me say it again...Oh. My. God.  Now THAT'S what a pizza should taste like.  - Thin crust, the perfect combination of crispy and chewy.  - Just the right amount of toppings, not so much that they're falling off, but not so little that I'm stealing stuff from other pieces.  - And the part that I was most impressed with: round slices of mozzarella for the cheese... not shredded mozzarella!  Unfortunately, it's a long wait to eat, and it's pretty crowded inside.  Despite being crowded, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, with dim lighting and checkered tablecloths.  Service is relatively quick, and prices are reasonable.  Just remember... cash only!",3/18/2008,960,372,605,s81VRLqYFEpXPIQtGx2mnw

We were only in the city for 6 nights and we wound up going back for dinner on our last night. That says a lot!For 2 of us, the house salad, which was simple and simply dressed with a delicious house Italian, was very good. We split  a small pie. Half all white and half traditional. It's great that they do that with the topping choices. The salad and pie were very filling and absolutely one of the best pies I have ever had.When we went for lunch I noticed the crust on the pie at the next table was a little dark. I asked for ours to be cooked a little lighter. I like my crust chewy. The pie was perfect. The second trip I asked for the same thing. Someone else brought our pie out and the crust was cooked a little more than I wanted - but still perfectly edible - it's just my preference. Our waitress came over and noticed and had a new pie out to us in ten minutes. Worth the wait!Even with all the food choices in NYC, and choices and food are my two favorite things, I will def go back here my next visit.",8/13/2011,434,248,539,unjfJawQK7uLtzo0jAPlLg

The pizza was very good for an authentic New York pizza. This restaurant is mostly a create your own pizza kind of place. Thin crust, tomato sauce (which really just tastes like Heinz tomato sauce from the can), very fresh mozarella cheese...Their sausages and meatballs were great as toppings. Extra mozarella cheese would also be delicious to have on their pizzas. Btw, they use a coal oven for their pizza. Go CANCER!If you have to go here, you should go in a big group.

When my fiancee and I arrived, we were seated right away. To get to the seats, we had to go through the kitchen and got a glance of how they made the pizza fresh which I thought was very cool. When it came to ordering, we ordered the staple Margherita pizza and a carafe of some pretty awesome sangria.  The pizza tasted just as amazing as it looked. I was mostly amazed by the crust which I just couldn't get enough of. It was to the point where I even took some crust pieces in my pocket to munch on once we left LOL.

We heard about how historic Lombardi's was, so we decided to come here at around 715pm on a Tuesday night. There was still a  relatively long wait!Once we were seated and ordered, we were waiting for a good 10-15 minutes for our food to arrive. (It might have been shorter than it seemed, but we were a starving group of college kids who'd flown in from California and gotten nothing to eat on our flights). The wait is worth it because I think they bake all their pizzas fresh upon order. We got the original, with lots of sauce and some splotches of cheese and oregano sprinkled on top. I wish there were more oregano! Even some additions of basil would have been nice. The pizza comes with a ton of sauce and unlike most pizzas I've eaten, is actually not covered in cheese. The crust is really good because you can taste how fresh-from-the-oven it was and I even had some coal on my hands LOL afterwards. $20 for a pizza for 4 people to get almost full off of (about 2 slices a person) is pretty good.",4/9/2012,169,443,11,FGmwQ2eV2pOy1j7u4Q-XrQ

Wish they were a bit more generous with the spinach considering the $3 topping charge, but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again! After a few visits, and always starting the meal off with the breadsticks, out of sheer hunger(and impatient kids)... i think i'm over them i have to say. They are fresh no doubt, but are very plain in flavor. The dipping sauce however is completely delish- if you decide to go with an order anyway, make sure to ask for extra sauce. I would suggest you opt for a more flavorful app, like the bruschetta.. heaping goodness!!I can say I have always had reasonably good service and have never been disappointed with my pies here...

I had heard about Lombardi's before I moved here, but hadn't eaten there yet. When my brother came to visit, he told me someone told him to eat at Lombardi's and I was so up for trying it out too. We (my brother, his friend & a couple of friends visiting from Germany) walked up early on Sunday and were able to get a table immediately. We were definitely just brilliant on good timing because there was a line and wait when we were leaving. Having heard so much about them, I was nervous my expectations might be too high. I was not at all disappointed! The pizzas- 1 with pepperoni and mushroom and 1 with just pepperoni- came and they were absolutely delicious. However what was great to me might not have really been great, so I was anticipating Elle and George's opinion, the couple from Germany. Considering they are from Germany and so close to REAL Italian food and pizza, this could've been complete crap. They loved it! It wasn't too cheesy and the crust was perfectly crisp. The sauce was flavorful and not at all overwhelming. Our server was nice and very attentive. The busser was quick and very prompt with cleaning the table. It was also cool eating at the first pizzeria, a fact which we didn't even know before coming in. Despite all the wonderfulness, I had to take a star because they DO NOT accept credit cards- it is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM attached outside and another one across the street at the deli if you do end up there without cash in hand.

The bill was $98.50 (this include one glass of wine, a 7 Up and Diet Coke. Net-net: Tourist Trap not worth the wait and very pricey.

The sauce, cheese, were the most worldly in my opinion, but as far ac crust and meat. You guys need to know, people do eat them too!

We got a large pizza half margarita with pepperoni and the other half white. Next time, I would skip the margarita half and just get the white because the sauce wasn't too great. But the white oh my goodness... so delicious. I am not a huge fan of cheese,  but this blend of cheese was absolutely perfect with just the right amount of ricotta flowers on top. I am actually salivating right now as I write this! (embarrassing). The crust was so good and the bread not too thick, so 3 small girls were able to (almost) finish a pizza bigger than us.So delicious.

3221,Anna C.,0,2,"I was super excited about dining here when I first arrived from SF bay area since there is a big hype about this place.  Felt rushed to order the pizza since they had to shut down the oven to clean at 4pm.  They should let their customers know before waiting for a long time to actually get seated, then to wait even longer for the oven. Overall I was pleased with the taste of the sauce but like I have read on other reviews...very little cheese!  I am sorry but gonna have to vote for North Beach Pizza in the SF Bay area for the best pizza   And CASH only too",8/30/2014,6,15,11,D53HQK0zAqso6feOLPwUYw

3223,Michael H.,0,4,"Walked right in and sat down at 6:30pm on a Monday, and ate with enough time to make our 8pm curtain.  Already, Lombardi's gets 4 stars :)This is a great pizza, although to be perfectly honest, I did not taste any ""smokiness"" from the coal oven that I assumed would have been there.  Perhaps it was presumptuous, but I thought that cooking in a coal oven was going to give the crust a little char flavor (like a good barbecue would) and be the one unique thing that sets this pizza apart from all the others.  From what I understand, Lombardi's is one of the few that can still cook with a coal oven.However, with that said, the high heat from the oven made the crust thin and crusty (hate soggy crust), and there was good distribution of the san marzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.  One did not overwhelm the other.  The meatballs and spinach we added to our pizza were good enough to stand on their own...even better topped on our already perfect pie.I wonder how this pie would taste cold (cause who doesn't like a slice of cold pizza for breakfast the next day), but did not have any leftovers.",8/27/2011,36,64,2,ZVUuvACyj1DYrgpXpQFJhg

3227,BJ L.,0,3,"Lombardi's is a pizza FACTORY. This is not a place to go if you like to sit and enjoy your food. Lombardi's pumps tourists and locals in and out as quickly as they can cook a pie. Did I just refer to a pizza as a 'pie'? I apologize for that...While the servers and staff don't intimidate you or actually forcefully rush you to eatandgetout, they sure make you feel like you SHOULD be in a hurry. It's really kind of magical how it all guys down. As you're (finally) sat at your table after what I would assume is a pretty standard 20-30 minute wait, you place your drink order almost immediately. Drinks are dropped and you order your pizza and apps. All this took approximately 3 minutes from host stand to food order.By the time our salads arrived 2 minutes later, Mrs. L and I realized that watching all the staff rush around, coupled with the speed and sheer ferocity of the ordering process, had made us eat and drink with that same speed and ferocity. We had to literally stop and force ourselves to slow down - the whole experience was basically riddled with anxiety because of this.The food was good. We loved the pizza. The wine selection is basically white or red, caraf or glass - a nice feature if you ask me. I get tired of having people (read: Mrs. L) pore over wine lists like there's a huge difference in varietals and regions...""We'll have a caraf of red,"" in this case was music to my ears.The food was good enough for a possible 4 stars, but the hurryupandeat attitude the staff exudes was definitely 2 star worthy.

The fresh mozzarella was amazing.  The meatballs were really good. The rest, not so much. The crust was well toasted, but lacked any sort of char. The sauce is what ruined it.

3267,Leah A.,0,1,"After seeing rave reviews I was looking forward too trying pizza from America's first pizzeria. Walked in and was told 20 minute wait (which was no problem) so the 6 of us went to the bar. We were informed that they don't sell any kind of domestic beer. We were seated promptly upstairs and ordered meatball and salad appetizers which were delivered immediately. Waitress was attentive. Salad arrived & was decent. Meatballs were honestly the worst thing I have ever placed in my mouth. 48 hours later I still have not been able to get the taste out my mouth. We ordered 2 large pizzas, one Margherita & one onion and meatballs again. Pizza was decent but nothing to write home about. Will not be back.",1/18/2015,0,7,0,qT7bi0jbx5WhxcL8czdejg
3268,Stephen D.,0,4,"I was visiting in NYC and wanted to visit the original Lombardi's Pizza for lunch.  Unfortunately or fortunately they don't sell by the slice so I had a whole pie to myself.  I went with the traditional pepperoni.  It was excellent as you would expect.  The heavens didn't sing and the angels didn't appear, however it was still very good. I think the issue with ""classic"" places like this is the build up of expectations and lore.  I will go again if I am in the area but it wasn't Nirvana.  But then maybe that is good that it wasn't.",9/27/2014,4,7,1,suK7L4dJAZ49iAp4sW0XGQ

The combination of flavors and ratio of cheese to sauce to crust were perfection. The coal oven roasted red peppers are simply not to be missed. We stuck with the base pizza and added the peppers and pepperoni and thought the small would be too much for the two of us. It was so good we ate every bite!

I personally don't know if either of those are true, but it doesn't matter. Because the pizza here is delicious. The Brick oven pizza at Lombardi's is crispy, cheesy, and just plain awesome. This restaurant's existence is the ONLY reason why I ever go down to NoLita. Lombardi's is pretty big, they even have space in the basement to seat people. The only bad thing about sitting in the basement is that it gets ridiculously hot down there. They also have good wines, and beer on tap. Overall, this place is cool, and wouldn't you like to tell people that you've been to ""America's First Pizzeria""?

3273,Mike K.,0,3,"Tourist trap. Overly hyped pizza. It's just pizza folks. If you put more than cheese and pepperoni on your pizza it's no longer a pizza, it's something else on a pizza. Pizza should be great standing alone in it's original form and shouldn't need fancy meats and veggies to cover up the perfectly selected cheese which compliments the perfect sauce in a complimenting ratio. That being said, you can grab a good slice from any pizza place up here. There is no such thing as life defining pizza found here at Lombardi's. I don't feel anymore in touch with New York in any other way other than paying too much for average pizza. I have real Italian restaurants in the county in Maryland that serve better pizza than this. Hostess can't tell time. We were told 1 hr 15 min wait. Handed a pager. 2 hours later still waiting for pizza at our table. They have Carryout, use it if you want to do something other than wait for pie. This is a cash only place. Not for your convienance, but for the owners ability to probably cook his books. Pain in the ass to not take cards. Parking? Ha! No such thing around here unless you want to pay $40 for a garage because this won't be a fast experience. Come in larger groups if you plan to sit. They cater to 4+ person parties. 2 people will have a longer wait. It's not first come first served as they seat based on table to party ratio. Makes no sense that you can't eat at the bar either. In fact it's total crap. The wine was crap and I was forced to drink it to hold my patience and now have heart burn from crappy wine. I would wait 2 hours for the best steak in NYC but not the best pizza. Just go get a slice for $1 in Times Square and move on with your day. This was not a life defining pizza. Also note, I don't write reviews of good places as much as I should, but it's because when it's outstanding, you are too busy enjoying everything to think of writing a review. But when you are pissed the experience wasn't what you thought it would be, bam!

3282,Sunny D.,0,4,"It's hard to find the best pizza in an area where they sell pizza on every corner, but I can vouch for Lombardi's being on spot with what people refer to as authentic NY pizza.We got the tip from a friend to go to Lombardi's and I knew exactly what I wanted to order when I got there.Wifey and I got a medium pie with Pepperoni and garlic. We asked for jalapenos, but they didn't have them. I was disappointed with that, but maybe, jalapenos on a pie in NY is uncommon???Anyway, the key here is to ask your pie to be extra crispy. When the waitress came out with our pie I was astounded by its size, and I didn't think my fat ass could eat half of it. I piled on ground pepper and crushed red pepper and proceeded to engulf my slice. I loved the crispy bottom and the gooey-mooey cheese on top. The tomato sauce was tangy, sweet and was the best part of the pie. The toppings were yummy too. I loved the garlic on top. But I still missed my jalapenos. :(We ended up going here twice, and the consistency was there. However, if you're planning to go to Lombardi's bring cash. They don't accept credit cards, even at the bar. Shrug.Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!",1/24/2011Previous review,55,95,88,ZctCT67EFyBmeUoydLTquA
3283,Shannon L.,1,3,"Another redundant Yelp review but I need it for my own reference!!So I've done the Grimaldi's thing and the Lombardi's thing and I would have to agree that I see them equally.  The styles are relatively similar and I would have to praise both for their fresh toppings.  They're both different from your typical NY hole-in-wall pizza joint because it isn't as greasy and tastes relatively healthy.  Lombardi's restaurant is bigger so the wait may not be as bad.  Actually on a Monday night, I waited about 5 minutes.  Pizzas come out fast and Italian sodas are a delight to drink too (tell them to be less generous with the whip cream though otherwise it'll take up half your cup).  My pizza toppings included pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and spinach... pretty standard I would say.  It came out delicious but I do think that Grimaldi's pepperonis are more flavorful.  I did notice some extra charred-ness on the crust though which was disappointing.  With such hype, your pizza should be almost perfect.  A large pizza with the toppings I got ended up being about $26.As for ambiance, Lombardi's has two levels - the main floor which is kind of old school and wooden and the lower level which is a well-furnished, quieter basement.  Service is top-notch.",6/25/2011,1412,2777,3487,NeXRy1C7PxS7bvIcQ3SymA

3285,Vinny V.,0,5,"A Tale of Two PizzasAsk 100 New Yorkers, who has the best Pizza in the city, and you would get at 100 different answers. But ask New Yorkers to name the top 10 pizzas in New York and it's a different story. You'll see a pattern start to emerge. Grimaldi's and Lombardi's make everyone's top ten list.On a beautiful June day I visited both pizzerias and ordered the same basic pizza, the Margherita. Fresh tomato sauce with buffaleta mozzerella cheese, basil and it should have fresh garlic. Lombardi's, located in NoLita (North of Little Italy), started selling pizza in New York City in 1905.  And Grimaldi's nestled snuggly under the Brooklyn Bridge, on the Brooklyn side, has a very colorful history and a very loyal following. Both pizzerias use coal fired brick ovens (reaching temperatures well over 800 degrees) and both use fresh mozzarella and the finest ingredients. Although Grimaldi's puts more cheese on their pizza the cheese Lombardi's uses has more flavor.  So if you don't have a cholesterol problem order extra cheese at Lombardi's.  You still come out even, price wise, as Grimaldi's charges for fresh garlic (a must) and it's free at Lombardi's. And even with extra sauce (the way I like it) the crust at Grimaldi's doesn't hold up to Lombardi's.  Lombardi's wins on many levels.  Better sauce, better cheese, crispier crust, friendlier serves and a great jukebox selection  And if that weren't enough, the jamooks at Grimaldi's wouldn't let me take a picture of their oven!",7/21/2014,246,9,2,TiOvJANp1fhUMBjJZbzxCQ

The cheese and all the ingredients blending together.. you will simply just love it..

No matter though, all skepticism was soon forgotten when the pizza arrived. The crust was perfect thickness, the amount of sauce was just right, and the pancetta was delicious. 3 of us split a large pizza.My only two complaints are I ordered 3 beers from the bar while we were waiting which cost $18. I found when got our menus that pitchers were $20. Wish the bartender would have just told me to order a pitcher. My other complaint is they don't take credit cards.

If the wait is under an hour and you feel like doing the touristy thing, definitely eat here at least once.I went with the Pepperoni because it's usually how I judge most pizza places since it's such a standard. If you can't make a good pepperoni pizza, you probably shouldn't be making pizza. Here everything about the pie was great except the pepperoni. The slices of pepperoni were about the size of a penny and looked excactly like the ones you'd get in the Chef Boyardee Pizza at home kits. The dough was great, cheese was good and the sauce was flavorful. We also got the clam pie, which was great but wasn't really in the mood for seafood that day but everyone else at the table loved it.Overall, like I said, I have had better. I've been there once but don't think I'll really be back unless it's to go with another person visiting for their first time.

That kinda set back my stomach a little since I was only planning on taking one bite just to say ""I had NY pizza."" We ordered a small Margherita pizza with extra sauce and mushrooms.

3322,Elizabeth T.,0,5,"How historical!  Incidentally, this is the first pizzeria in the US.  I read in a Lonely Planet guide that this was the oldest pizzeria in the city.  I concluded that if it's the oldest, there must be something really great about since it's still standing.  (Okay, that could be faulty logic, but it was super crowded, too!)We were seated within 5 minutes and served right away.  Our server was very friendly and prompt; not to mention purdy :) We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of mushrooms; I'm no expert but I'm guessing it was portobello & porcini, which made for a different, non-typical-American ( white button) flavor.  It was hot and delicious and we had no problem polishing off the pie in its entirety.I know everyone's pizza expectations are different, but this pizza was fantastic to me.  It does not taste like New York/American pizza.  No, this one brought me back to Napoli, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars.At the end of the night, we paid for our bill, which I thought fair because of the wonderful pizza and experience I had here.  Upon request, our server also recommended a place for dessert.  All in all, a great experience and I'd come back next time I'm in NY :)",10/14/2009,195,510,719,woLSJl4U1Un0lfYTYpCUwg

Not too much and not too little of any one thing.The restaurant is quite small though, so prepare to bump elbows some what.  The kitchen was very clean, I got to go in to check out the brick oven and the chef's that made the master piece.  I also had a glass of Sangria with my meal...we ordered one pie to share, I think it was the special (not sure) but we ate every last bit.  They do not take credit cards but there is an ATM machine available.",5/4/2012,36,23,1,qovqpz1fB3IcX41FP0DvxQ

3341,Mike O.,0,5,"Overall, great pizza, good service.My wife and I ate here last night and we enjoyed it overall. She may have thrown out the ""pizza pizza in New York"" superlative, but I wouldn't go that far. I enjoy John's and Grimaldi's a bit more, but not much more.The restaurant, at first glance, seems to have a claustrophobic, frenzied atmosphere about it. Tourists and locals swarm around the door, waiting for their names to be called, or putting their names in to be called. This creates an uncomfortable bottleneck at both the entrance and at the bar, but something a New Yorker must bear with regularity. We were seated within a half an hour, and sat downstairs, which is much quieter. I almost wish we had been seated at one of the loud, upstairs tables, but it was okay. Sinatra oozed out the speakers, and we were served promptly by a polite waitress.We ordered two small pizzas, which was too much pizza, but we intended to bring home leftovers. We ordered a meatball, pepperoni and extra mozzarella pizza, and a sausage, garlic and spinach pizza. Both were fantastic, with the former beating out the latter due to the fantastic meatballs.Here's a quick rating of Lombardi's pizza:Crust: above average. Chewy, New York style thin crust; reminds me of Grimaldi's; not too floppy, not too stiffCheese: very good; gooey; just the right amount; extra cheese wasn't necessarySauce: weakest part of the pizza; thin, almost flavorless, but I couldn't tell because there wasn't a lot of sauce.Toppings: perhaps the best, freshest, tastiest toppings in New York. Better toppings than anywhere I've been at in the city.Overall, Lombardi's is clearly among the best, although not my personal favorite. Not overly salty pizza, and not overly sweet. A very nice, balanced pizza.Ambiance: Loud and crowded upstairs, quiet and less ""atmospheric"" downstairs. Prompt service. Also very important: you don't feel like you're being rushed out of the place like some big-name pizza restaurants in the city. I should probably rate this place a four out of five stars, but I love pizza too much, I'm biased.",6/19/2011,211,1720,570,cuVrNmt7_WtBn1uz5L_p0g

3351,Allen Y.,0,3,"My friends talked this place up a LOT, saying they heard it was the best pizza place in NYC. Pretty tall order, since there are pizza joints all over the place! I was half-expecting this to be the sort of hole-in-the-wall place that surprises you with its divinely-inspired food, but it's actually a fairly typical sit-down restaurant. When we got there, we were just aiming for a snack, since it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday. With our party of 10, we were seated almost immediately, but at two separate tables, which we were fine with.To order pizza, you first pick a base size and essentially just pay for that (and I'm assuming the tomato sauce and cheese). You then pay $3 for each topping. This makes for quite an expensive pizza if you're looking for something complex, but I guess this is how ""fancier"" pizza places do it.The pizza may look large, but because it's thin you can probably eat more than you think. There are six slices in both the small and the large, and even though I wasn't hungry I felt like I could have easily scarfed down at least two slices of the small. We ended up getting the meatballs (yummy) and mushrooms (kinda normal). But I will say that the tomato sauce is pretty good, and everything tasted more fresh and, in some vague sense, 'authentic'.If you're a fan of New York-style pizza (with the thin crust, a bit more emphasis on the sauce and ""traditional"" ingredients), then you'll love this place.

3355,Yvonne W.,0,2,"My friends and cousin came with me to Lombardi's because I wanted to go here after hearing so many good things about it. When we first stepped in, we were told that the wait would be 45 minutes and that we should put our name on the list and come back then. So that's what we did. We walked around the neighborhood, came back after 40 minutes, and then saw that our name was crossed off the list. My friend was so ticked off that she confronted the hostess, and the hostess said, ""well, I called your name, but you didn't respond."" My friend: ""you told us to come BACK in 45 minutes!"" The hostess's response? ""You should have been here."" And then she asked us if we wanted to be placed at the end of the list in this incredibly rude tone of voice. NO. We DON'T. Good thing that another host came to take her place, saw the whole problem, and immediately had us seated. Then we were seated. We had sausage, mushroom, and another meat (can't remember) on our pizza with lots of extra garlic. One of my friends who loves pizza could not stand the sausage at all. She said it tasted like cardboard. After I tasted it, I definitely felt that the texture was too rubbery. Why don't they used crushed sausage here? The pizza crust itself was good, but I think this place is pretty overhyped. I rather go to John's Pizzeria in Greenwich than this place. The sausage AND the crust are good there.",5/14/2008,99,396,219,77v6pvzEUjazCuqKSwpT3w

The pepperonis are the kind that are small and thick and get perfectly crispy on the edges and ooze the right amount of grease to make a grown man cry at the first bite. Ok maybe a little overboard but the pizza is perfect. Great fresh mozz, awesome toppings, sauce is divine and that coal fired crust puts it over the top. Gotta have good crust to call it a good pizza pie.Can't wait to visit New York again so I can pop my greasy face in here again.",10/6/2011,86,98,19,KZFzcTqETO2nWgl8A57cmg

We like to get a pitcher of sangria too. It's a very welcoming and relaxing environment - great for family and group gatherings - and the staff are always friendly and attentive. The restaurant is spacious so there won't be a huge wait time. You really have nothing to lose here, so just go and enjoy. Cash only, though!",4/17/2014,10,159,157,rq1itJ8DSRUT2eEx8HxINg
3362,Jeff W.,0,4,"Been coming here since *before* it was a tourist trap (it's really only been one for about the last 10 years). Back then they had one small room with a door that let all the elements in. You could get a table any night of the week with no wait. And their pizzas cost about ten bucks.Today it's always jam packed in all of their many rooms and a pizza with one or two toppings on it is going to cost more like $35. But the pizza itself tastes the same. This is the real thing, folks - don't let anyone tell you different. If you don't like Lombardi's, you don't like New York pizza - simple as that. Lombardi's defined it in the first place. Coal oven for that crispy yet soft mouth feel and charcoal flavor, sliced mozzarella (never accept grated mozzarella!), fresh ingredients, and a sauce that's to die for. Seriously, it is the sauce that really sets Lombardi's apart, because it's the one part of a pizza most pizzerias completely ignore. It's Grimaldi's' biggest failing, for example - lots of people swear Grimaldi's is better but their sauce is like water. Lombardi's' sauce is just bursting with fresh tomato flavor.I'm dinging them one star because no way any pizza should ever cost $35, and the price increase from just a few years ago cannot be justified. It makes it basically impossible for real New Yorkers to consider Lombardi's their go-to pizzeria. There are so many pizza places at less than half the price that are 80% as good, the value proposition just isn't there.But I still go once in a while for a real treat.",11/23/2014,17,18,1,sxlF4sqsMeEWv5G-0xfsaw
3363,Janine C.,0,3,"I happened upon Lombardi's one evening when it was closed and was intrigued by the advertisement of the coal oven. I'd also heard good things about it so I headed back last night. Apparently there is almost always a wait, but it's not a substantial one. There's nothing noteworthy about the restaurant itself. It's clearly historical (they claim to be the first ""real"" pizza shop in New York) and the pictures of celebrities in the restaurant are somewhat entertaining. We started with a caesar salad. There was no option of adding chicken which was sad, but the dressing made up for it; it was thick, creamy and had an unexpected little kick. It was also generously slathered onto the lettuce and the fresh croutons were nice and crispy. We also had a small meatball pizza. Although the crust is undeniably good, I was really disappointed with the taste level of the sauce and meatballs which needed more salt. They were also stingy on the mozzarella. Overall, this was not what I expected to get for such a pricey pizza! It was kind of bland and well ... average. Grimaldi's is next on my pizza list. I hope it doesn't disappoint!",7/28/2011,217,139,33,OZ0nircH1Ea5_qDRAmIBew
3364,David G.,0,4,"I've been to Lombardi's on several occasions, and everytime it's always the same great pizza. Depending on where you're from Lombardi's pizza may be different than what you're used too. I, personally, always get the margherita pizza, but they have many toppings available. The sauce is a chunkier authentic tomatoe sauce, and the cheese is a very light mozzarella. Delicious combination!As far as ""the feel"", the restaurant is typical american-Italian, with checked tablecloths and black & white photos covering the walls.If you're in NYC it's pretty much a must for any pizza sage to hit up Lombardi's!

Now, i get it... now i get why i have to wait an hour for a table here! Ok.. also... a very under rated item here is the salad! It has this special purple dressing and is so yummy!

3406,Sue N.,0,3,"When I lived in this neighborhood, I used to grab pizza from here on occasion.  Since most of the places in this area are sit-down italian restaurants, it is a good option if you want to grab some pizza to go.Many years later, I learned the history of the pizzeria -- apparently it's supposed to be the oldest pizzeria and one of the best in NY.  I was surprised.  I've always found the quality of the pizza to be inconsistent.  Maybe it's because the line can be long, but one some days the pizza is good - -with a crispy crust and the hot cheese oozing, and other times it's kind of cold and not delicious.It's pretty cool to watch them make the pizza and put them into the flaming pizza oven.  Definitely try it if you haven't been because it's a New York institution.  But I'm not sure if it's where New Yorkers get their pizza.",12/6/2011,55,71,282,5sccxHrwFL047NRX_4_I6g

""what?"" with a weird look on both of our faces. ""this is the best new york pizza? seriously?"" the pizza was so incredibly soggy it was just not appetizing. the toppings were extremely uneven on the pizza. while one slice was covered with mushrooms, one slice was pure cheese with an olive on it. it just didnt look right. we ate most of it because we were starving, but in no way were impressed whatsoever. it makes me feel like we got a bad batch because all of the other reviews say otherwise. but the experience was really really dissapointing.if this is the best pizza in new york..well then i'm not impressed.",6/28/2011,15,123,24,kHi449Mn8K16tP4Aheiz-A

Though I'm not a fan of sausage on pizza, the homemade sausage had good flavor. The four of us easily finished it. A little too easy since we decided to order a medium white pizza. For a regular meal, this would have been stupid but since we were visiting and wouldn't be back, we had to try it.Totally worth it. The white pizza was chock full of cheese, stringy and delicious.

So, it is worth seeing; worth dining at even, but is hardly best in class.The place is eclectic and sort of cool. We sat at a table in a sort of hallway. Service was OK, but a little slow. The place seemed to not really cater overly to customers; an example of this is that they are a world famous restaurant that is cash-only. The pizza was good. We had a margherita and some salads. The pie was good; the crust was tasty. I thought a margherita had tomato slices instead of sauce; this pizza had sauce which seemed to me to be inauthentic. Also, the basil on top was meager, shredded, and seemed to be pretty dried out (i.e. not fresh).In short, you should eat here...but only once.",10/30/2011,107,124,15,xkvKnAmpfCinhUP2wYO-sQ

No its actually a sit-down little-italy-esque restaurant that just has a menu resembling that of a quickie pizza stand.Came here on a monday night, there was no wait and lots of open tables. Split a small with two friends we did half plain and half ricotta with meatballs. The ricotta topping was pretty good, I highly recommend it. The meatballs were just so-so but I am kind of a meatball snob. The plain had of the pizza could have used more cheese, most of it was just tomato sauce on slightly burnt crust. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the pizza here a little more if I didn't come in expecting and craving authentic NY pizza.

The original Lombardi's opened several blocks away in 1897 as a grocery store, and was licensed as a pizzeria in 1905. Gennaro Lombardi sold his tomato pies for a nickel. Italian immigrant construction workers who couldn't afford the whole pie would buy the portion they could afford, which is where the slice comes from. The oven is new, but the brick facade is the original.What makes this pizza special is that the mozzarella comes from a few blocks away at Alleva where they make it fresh daily. No oils, which means it cools faster (oil retains heat). The tomatoes for the sauce are from Modesto, CA. where apparently the best tomatoes are grown. Who knew? Scott, that's who. Take the tour!

3446,Luke B.,0,3,"Lombardi's was our first NYC pizza experience in years. At 3pm on a Friday, it was packed - always a good sign. We had read online that they are cash only, so we came prepared. Once seated in a narrow hallway with  fans blasting  (not enough to keep up with all the people and hot ovens), menus were dropped on our table. The first things we noticed around the restaurant, were pictures of the owner, professionally taken selfies. The walls were literally filled with shots of the like, as well as advertisements for their overpriced t-shirts. The words ""tourist trap"" flashed in our minds.  It wasn't much better when we looked at our menus. Over $20 for a small pizza, and 3 to 5 dollars per topping. We settled on a small pizza with 3 toppings. Our waitress never came by to refill our water cups, and we waited a solid 30 minutes for the pizza. The pizza was pretty good. They were, however, stingy on the toppings that we had paid $15 for. We had to flag down another waiter to get our cups refills. Never once did our waitress check up on us to see how the pizza was, or how we were doing. When we finally caught her to ask for the check, we waited another 10 minutes for her to bring it. Of course, we put cash in the folder, and set it on the corner of the table for her to pick up. It took her a while to actually pick up the bill, and she did she did not bring back our change. She walked by to help other customers multiple times, completely ignoring us. When she finally realized we were waiting for our change, she eventually came back with a large bill. This did not leave us with any smaller bills to leave her tip, so unfortunately we were forced to leave her a larger tip than we felt was right and that she really deserved for the service. Overall, the pizza is good, but $40 for a small pizza and terrible service was just not worth it.

3450,Rebecca P.,1,3,"We ordered for delivery, so I cannot complain much about the wait or the ambiance. However, when I called on the phone, I did have to try a few times to get passed the busy signal. But, once I did, the people were extremely nice and thorough, being patient with my price requests and delivery details not yet being set in stone (as I had not yet arrived at my hotel). And, I had to call back and change/downgrade my order, and they took it with no problem. We ordered a cheese, a veggie with spinach, and a half pepperoni and meatball plus two house salads. I asked for all utensils and stuff, and the order arrived within the promised 45 minutes with the pizza hot and ready to eat with plenty of sides of spices, plates, utensils, napkins and such. The salads each came in a 9"" tin, so that was quite the awesome serving for $7.50, making up for the pricey pizza. Everyone was quite pleased and thought the pizza was ""amazing"", although personally I was happy that the pizza used fresh ingredients like real mozzarella but didn't like the pseudo-gourmet feel of my pizza haven't so much of its canvas covered only in sauce. I could barely taste the cheese on the cheese or meat pizzas--though the meatballs were great, as Yelp reviews promised, masking the slightly burnt crust (overall 3 star). The veggie on the other hand was awesome, with plenty of cheese and garlic and flavor (5-star). Bottom line? I don't think I'd go back if I was looking for a NY pizza fix both because gourmet is not what I crave and neither is over $20 a pie. And, I doubt I'd tolerate the wait that on-site diners speak of. But, Lombardi's served well to be a last-minute order-in ""fancy"" dinner for a bachelorette party when every other place was booked, keeping prices lower than some other places and leaving us time to prepare for the bars... and come back to leftovers to soften the hangover!",9/21/2011,289,865,173,jQrJ4PshFYv-QG7rjycFhA

3454,Bryce B.,1,4,"OK, I have been to New York *a lot* and have tried many pizza places, desperately seeking the quintessential pie.  And, I have been mightily disappointed, until tagging along with some co-workers to Lombardi's.  I had seen this place featured on Food Network and knew that it was an old time joint with a coal burning oven.The place was busting at the seams and we had to wait about 40 minutes to get our table.  No problem, since I was promised an excellent example of NY style thin crust pizza.  I was not disappointed.  The test of any pizza is the dough, and Lombardi's was crisp and chewy.  Since this oven hovers around 800 degrees, the pies bake quickly and the cheese gets a nice blistered browning.  Although a bit of a tourist trap, I would definitely go again.  I'm not saying this is the best pizza in the city, but it is the best I've had so far.",5/5/2009,786,611,41,dR9OiTIjuzvDdoqjuulKrw

3457,Chris L.,1,3,"Hm, I don't know what the big deal about Lombardi's is.  Our three-topping pizza was $25 (italian sausage, meatball (beef/pork) and mushroom) and each glass of Sangria was $7.  The Sangria was heavy and not good and the pizza was just average.  The location is near the subway and you'll see a mosaic Mona Lisa outside.  We were seated in the alleyway of the restaurant that looked like the employee's entrance and hall turned into another narrow part of the restaurant.  The tile looked like bathroom tile so I didn't like that when we were seated since we were going to be eating while looking at bathroom tile they have at our hotel at the Sheraton NY (I'm not kidding, it's exactly the same).  The service was quick but not genuine, which is fine b/c they were busy.  We carried our expensive leftovers home but finally threw it away three days later.",6/3/2009,700,1842,1297,uZdFsE_aHbFBChgN6Xa8tw

While there weren't any complaints, I just think we were let down by the hype.However, the $22/person we spent on pizza and beer went a lot further than it would have at other restaurants.

We were walked through the restaurant, wound through the middle of the kitchen and up some back stairs to some ancillary seating with huge tables. We ordered two pitchers of soda and two large pies: margarita and sausage. Oh my god it was good. The sauce was tomato-y but not too sweet and balanced perfectly with the cheese and basil. And the sausage, wow. I don't know where they get the sausage but it's great quality and flavor. Not too much fennel, just enough spice to stand out- YUM. Was this my favorite pizza ever? Nah.

The restaurant had a family feel to the place and had all the workers working hard with their headset.  This is your typical pizza red and white checkered italian decor!We ordered a large pepperoni pizza since it wasn't that much more.  Each additional topping was $3 extra.  Coming from California, that's pretty damn steep! $3 just for one topping!  But it didn't matter, we were expecting it already :) One less star because our waitress was definitely rude!  She took her time with out order even though other tables came AFTER us.  When we told her we were ready to order, she said hold on I will be with you soon... and took her time going around the room clockwise until she hit us.. wth?!?  Worst of all, when we paid our bill, which we tipped graciously and not even under.  She walked off, counted the money and shook her head like she was pissed off at us... Um, We didn't underpay you, AND you gave us bad service.  Shouldn't people be thankful for the tip that they get for the type of SERVICE they give you?

3475,Faye F.,0,4,"My friend Sean has been raving about Lombardi's pizza and Ceasar salad since we met. I've been wanting to go to Lombardi's for even longer, but I haven't wanted to brave the lines. I finally got my taste yesterday. It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon so we got right in and were seated downstairs.I have to hand it to Sean. When he's right, he's right. He had promised me an exceptionally great Ceasar salad and that's what we got. There was ample creamy dressing on the crisp romaine lettuce. Though there were no fresh anchovies on the salad, you could taste just the right amount in the dressing. Yum!After about 20 minutes, just as our friendly waitress had promised, our pizza arrived. We had ordered the small original (6 generous slices) topped with sweet Italian sausage, red onions and fresh garlic. Great combination. The small original is made with fresh mozzarella, a balanced San Marzano tomato sauce that provides both texture and taste, and topped with fresh basil. Our pie must have come straight out of the coal oven.  The tomato sauce and cheese melted onto our plates, making a knife and fork a necessity for the first couple of slices. By the third slice, the ingredients were sturdier since they had cooled a bit, so I picked up the slice and bit into it directly.The flavors of the initial slices were fully infused, different combinations melting in my mouth to create a unique taste. In contrast, the toppings on the slice that I picked up each maintained their distinct taste creating a pop of individual flavors. Either way - whether as a gooey melting pot or as a mosaic of flavors - each slice was a tantalizing delight for my pizza-loving palate.If you're a pizza lover, give this cash-only restaurant a try. There's a reason why it's been around since 1905, making it America's first pizzeria.",4/2/2012,6,49,0,OUbAG4R--jS-qzusM6pV0Q

The only flavor I got from the pizza was the salty dough. My friend and I just ate one piece each. There was a little asian tourist girl sitting next to us who ate like 5 pieces by herself.

So when I had the opportunity of venturing to Brooklyn n dine at the world renowned ""Lambardi's"" I felt like a kid on Christmas morning.  As we entered the establishment I was amazed at how big the place was. Granted there wasn't one big room but rather several tiny/ narrow rooms. I loved how the hostess walked us through the kitchen n past many other rooms to take us to our table. It certainly added to the ambiance (old school Italian eateries). I was so excited to finally be sitting in front of a table, at a restaurant I'd never thought I get to visit. However, that excitement turned to shear disappointment when the food arrived. We ordered the meatballs n bruschetta as apps n they were great, but the pizzas margarita & a pizza with mushrooms left something to be desired. While the crust (texture n flavor) were good the rest of it was lacking salt, cheese, flavor, flavor, and more flavor. I must say I have had much better pizza in the past at other pizzerias. I was in disbelief n for a while thought I had read the wrong reviews and/or come to the wrong place. Prices were reasonable but the waitstaff was not attentive and did nothing to make me or my guest feel special (waited 15 min for check after asking 3 times and no one offered un replenishments our drinks) . I got the impression that the reputation spoke for it self, rather than the food & service providing a reputation for the business.  Perhaps they had an off day, but I will never be back to find out. If you want to visit this famous joint to say u have eaten here great but if your in the mood for excellent quality pizza n service there's much better pizzerias out there to be discovered. Service: Below average Food: Average",7/14/2014,0,2,0,FXrJF-U0YWqR4GD110Qp5A

3503,Roger H.,1,2,"overpriced and ordinary at best this is a place you can avoid cause you really are not missing much if you have never been here before. The sauce and toppings were adequate enough but the cheese on the pizza had the texture and consistency of day old chewed up bubble gum. I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and sausage and  as I pulled my slice of the pizza apart the toppings and cheese proceeded to dart onto the other slice of pizza. Go to your local pizzeria in your neighborhood, their pizzas are probably just as good for half the price",3/14/2011,520,249,875,13gQi5fpbFEKDcUweTDRxw

I think the rain might've added to how good it was considering it was cold outside and a Pizza pie was the perfect solution. I ordered a Pizza with Peppers, Italian Sausages, and mushroom. It was fantastic and the drinks to go along with it was not too shabby as well. I ordered a Apple Cider type of drink and some soda float. The service is top notch as well.

3505,Chris S.,0,4,"Although I prefer Grimaldi's over this place, I still have to give homage to their great tasting pizza. The taste is very similar to Grimaldi's, but the crust is a little different. Service and seating is also a notch up Grimaldi's since they actually treat their customer's like they appreciate their business.They only have two sizes: large and small. For the $4 price difference, go for the large unless it's just you eating the pizza. Also, if you're from California, you'd probably associate thin crust pizza with crunchiness. Their crust is in no way crunchy. Also, keep it simple. You don't need to put 5 different toppings on the pizza. Two to three toppings makes an amazing pizza at this place.Be prepared to wait at the very least 1 hour or avoid the lunch/dinner rush!",11/11/2011,287,236,305,7EC0CsYLdvocoG3Qn_jAsw

However the margarita pizza was delicious.  Sweet, robust tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil.  What more can you ask for.  Service was fast and straight to the point, however our waitress messed up our order, but we let it slide.My party didn't have to wait long (10 mins) so that was definitely a plus.  It was a fun experience, but their is a 50/50 chance I would make a trip back.  It was just okay.",2/25/2011,109,47,4,hru4qbTqE5PzNkzp8UzwTw

I don't usually notice the sauce when eating a slice, but this was delicious! I also had a white pizza, but I didn't like that very much.This place has one of the last coal fired ovens in the area.

Since it was a heavy snow+rain+wind+cold day, we only waited for 10min and then we got a table near the exit. I love pizza because it has cheese (my love) and meat (my love). We ordered a tomato bread appetizer and a meatball mushroom pizza full of cheese. We finished the whole pie without taking a rest.

3522,Stella Y.,0,4,"This place has amazing pizza. Better than Grimaldi's! I appreciate non-NY style pizza which is usually flimsy and never has that awesome CRUNCH. So I thoroughly enjoyed Lombardi's - the crust is delicious and the pizza comes out piping hot. You always get that fun, stretchy cheese action too. Last time I went, we ordered the white pizza with spinach, and another pie with half extra cheese only, half with pepperoni, sausage, roasted red peppers and mushrooms. It was divine! Seriously, can't praise it enough.Their salads are also a good size, and they're delicious. Only minor gripe is that the caesar salad has too much dressing on it. Next time, I would definitely order it with light dressing.This place is always packed, but with good reason. If you're ever in NY and want some great pizza, and not the usual run-of-the-mill stuff, I'd probably pick Lomardi's over anywhere else (hmm, actually it's a close tie with Aperitivo across town!).

This is a cool historic place and we really wanted to try it out, so glad we did. The crust is perfectly crispy but soft inside, the cheese is heavenly, and the pepperoni was salty and yummy. The only thing I didn't love is I asked for a side of sauce to dip my crust in, and I loved the pizza sauce, but the side sauce was something different--maybe marinara? Anyway I didn't care for the flavor but it was fine, maybe next time I would specify that I'd like a side of pizza sauce. Service was friendly and prompt without making you feel rushed, and I can't forget to mention, the house wine is CHEAP! We also had a caesar salad which was good but I expect that in an Italian restaurant.If you're looking for a great place to have some real NY pizza, this is it.",12/11/2013,2,49,18,Dn7JR-RgTPh8EuJkWAbPpg

The regular pizza was delicious and the toppings were soo flavorful. I didn't like the white pizza much.  There was so much ricotta cheese it really killed it. The meatball toppings were good though. Overall, it was okay and im a new fan of thin sliced pizzas. I don't think it would be worth the wait though. There was only 1 server for a packed house. Suprisingly, she did a pretty good job.

We brought in outside food (cheesecake) because it was our friends birthday and she told us ""don't mean to be a party pooper but you're not allowed to have outside food."" That's fine, I understand, but there was absolutely no need for you to have such a rude tone and expression on your face.Thats not the worse part. She gave us the check when we still had food on the table. I'm pretty sure that's the rudest thing that a waitress has ever done to my friends and I. She was basically telling us to leave. We really did not want to give tip but we didn't want to be as rude as she was being so we did.The food was amazing and the man serving the water was incredibly nice, but that waitress needs to go.

3558,Vince E.,0,5,"32 Spring. This address is synonymous with great pizza. Dubbed the first pizzeria in the US , it wouldn't matter if it was the last because of the apparent goodness of its margherita pizza. A herby tomato sauce, fresh mozzerella, diced basil, and if you're into it, ask for extra garlic to be baked into the pie. The flavors meld together with a crust, that itself is very tasty. It really must be that new york water.One taste and you will understand why there is consistently a line out the door and why Lombardis is practically legendary. This is certainly my favorite pizza spot in the city. If you have doubts, order the large, you won't regret it, there will not be leftovers.",1/16/2012Previous review,223,674,1478,3qRovLbdNAPbrRwL4I7MNA

I am not the type to wait so long for a table but it was definitely worth it... Though if it wasn't for the sangria we may have moved on to the next place.

3571,Jessi J.,0,4,"First off let me say the reason why I gave this place 4 starts instead of 5. I would love to give it a 4.9, because I just recently reviewed another pizza joint called south Brooklyn pizza and even though both of these pizza places are amazingly good south Brooklyn just gets thats .1 extra point better. Lombardi's was the original NY pizza joint, so of course, I had to give it a shot.  Now to the pizza. Yes for a pizza it was a little pricy but it was worth it. It came with fresh mozzarella and homemade tomato sauce. The crust was just soft and crispy enough where you get that crunch but isn't scraping your gums either. It was an old school, old style restaurant where you sit right next to someone else eating their pizza, I didn't mind though, meeting new people is always interesting.Great experience for my first slice of New York Pizza, when in doubt go here and you won't be disappointed.",2/28/2011,128,35,0,mXbXQxU6o6lBBNKk_tJY1Q
3572,Lena X.,0,4,"I feel like Lombardi's is one of those places, kind of like Ippudo and Shake Shack, that suffer from waytoomuchfuckinghype syndrome. This is usually characterized by justifiably good food, but a disproportionately long wait due to tourists who have ZOMG seen it on __(insert food-related TV program)__ or OMFG read about it in __(insert magazine name)__ or !!!!!! heard about it from a __(insert social or familial connection)__ and are soooooooo stoked to have their authentic New York pizza experience!!Fuck that. The pizza here is good--as everyone else has said, it has a just slightly charred thin crust that is the right amount of chewiness. They let you pick your own toppings and will gladly do a half/half pizza for you. Service is nothing exceptionally good or horrendous, and seating is better on the ground floor over the basement. It's got the whole New Yorky exposed brick really warm lighting thing going on, but something about it doesn't quite match up to the ambience of lets say Minetta Tavern (which is also hyped but I'll give credit to for having a nice, more authentic New Yorky feel to it). I guess the hoards of shopped-out tourists diminish the feeling of this place a bit. And the wait doesn't help.But I'm still giving this four stars for actually pretty good pizza and sentimental value, because this is the first legit restaurant I went to for dinner the first summer I spent in New York, after almost getting arrested for piggybacking in the subway (long story) and blatantly ignoring the undercover cop whom I assumed to be a drug dealer and then charming my way out of trouble with my gorgeous Dutch friend (who was 16) and learning for the first time how convenient it is to be a girl in New York.

3587,Ryan H.,0,4,"Lombardi's Pizza in New York, NY is recognized as the first pizzeria in the United States originally opened by Gennaro Lombardi in 1905.  Gennaro Lombardi was an Italian immigrant who began serving Neopolitan pizza in the Little Italy district of Manhattan in 1897 and received a license for his restaurant by the city of New York in 1905.  Amazingly, Lombardi's Pizza has continued to thrive over the past hundred-plus years, and it has expanded into quite a large restaurant with many different seating areas.  Still, you can expect to wait to be seated as this is a famous site, and they hold onto some older traditions by only accepting cash and not offering free refills of soda (although you can get pitchers of soda and beer that are a better deal than getting them by the glass).I started my meal at Lombardi's Pizza with the bread sticks.  Honestly, they were rather plain and not too great, but they were pretty fluffy which allowed them to nicely soak up the delicious tomato sauce they were served with.  Still, I might recommend trying another appetizer such as their bruschetta instead.  Next, I ordered their original margherita pizza that is made with San Marzano tomato sauce, Pecorino Romano, and fresh basil, and I added pepperoni to half of it to get a taste of their other toppings.  Lombardi's has stayed true to the roots of their Neopolitan-style pizza, and, therefore, the highlight of it is the sauce, just as it was with the bread sticks.  Their sparingly placed slices of Romano cheese further draw your focus to the sauce - as opposed to pizzas with shredded cheese covering the entire pie.  The crust was thin and slightly charred, and the pepperoni had some good spice to it.  The pizza at Lombardi's is good enough to earn a recommendation, and the fact that it is a historic pizza landmark only strengthens my resolve to recommend eating there if ever in Manhattan around Little Italy.",4/5/2013,62,117,14,WBpQDAZymU0dhIqXcACGNw

Hubby and I hailed a cab from midtown to this NYC institution on a Friday night and were met with a short wait of about 25 minutes. Loved the cozy interior! We were seated in the lower level wine cellar area and waited on quickly. They are efficient without being impatient. Ordered a Six Point draft beer from Brooklyn (tasty and local), an order of breadsticks with sauce, and a medium pie with extra cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs. Absolutely amazing! The thinness of the pizza and lightness of the sauce were a pleasant surprise and coupled with the freshness of the ingredients made for a perfect dinner.Looking back, even though the breadsticks were good we wished we had passed on those and ordered a large pie instead.  Bottom line: Steep cab ride was totally worth it to this NYC gem. Will be back and will be sure to send friends looking for the real deal.  *We followed up dinner with dessert at Rice to Riches (hubby's review posted on Yelp) which was the perfect topper to our first night in the city.",8/25/2011,16,182,8,nRGPt0d8SH9hdegkeVqlTA

3598,Erika V.,0,3,"I like Lombardi's. If you're on a NYC pizza tour, stop here. I'm sure there are better places for NYC style pizza, but c'mon, this pizza is damn good. It's been around forever and it wouldn't have survived this long without being good. However, I'm not sure it's worth waiting 45 minutes outside in the cold for. Granted when I'm at home and if and when I order pizza, I still need to wait for it to get to my house, usually a 30 to 45 minute wait. So taking that into account, this is definitely a much higher quality pizza if you're going to spend 45 minutes waiting for it anyway.When I came to Lombardi's it was packed to the brim. The waiting arena inside was shoulder to shoulder packed, and even outside on the corner was packed of people for their names waiting to get called. Every time a name was called out it was complete and utter silence, that was the funniest part of it all. Our pizza came topped with fresh mozzarella, lots of garlic in olive oil, prosciutto, fresh basil and red onions. It was really, really good. I love brick oven baked pizzas that get that crunchy crust on the bottom. Really, really delicious. We also ordered a large salad which easily fed the whole table. It's completely unnecessary to order a large for one person.The only part of Lombardi's I really didn't care for was the rushed feeling of get in, eat, get out. I get that they're busy and they're trying to accommodate everyone, but really, you finish your last slice of pizza and within 2 seconds the check is in front of you? Harsh. This is the reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. I did not like their service at all. I had to ask for salad dressing 800 times and asking for water was treated like a crime. Too bad, too.

It was delicious, yes, and the atmosphere exactly what you'd expect of a New York Italian Pizzeria.But it wasn't so amazing or anything beyond what you'd find at a more upscale pizzeria in L.A.

3612,Jay R.,0,5,"First time I've been here was a couple of years ago. There was a 2 hour wait, I think it was a Saturday or something. I was there with a couple of friends, and we couldn't wait, so we walked around, and found Ray's (the original one). We went into Ray's, and the guy at the counter was a dick and had a horrible attitude. We asked for a pizza, didn't remember which one it was, they said they had no tomato sauce, I was like..okayy..and then we asked for another pizza, it might of been a white pizza, and then they said they had no more cheese..I don't know if they were fucking with us, maybe cause I came in with 3 other Asian friends and a hispanic guy, and the counter guy probably didn't think we spoke English, but we left upset, I heard they closed down, so I'm glad.Anyways, we went back to Lombardi's, and waited around an hour or so, they called our name, we ordered 3 pies, and the pizza came in less than 5 minutes piping hot. The pies were awesome, maybe one of the best thin crust I've ever tasted. The ingredients were top notch, but this wasn't a pizza that can be delivered and eaten 30 minutes later, it had to be eaten right out of the oven at the restaurant. Ever since, I've been back a dozen times. This place is also ""America's First Pizzeria"", not sure how true that is, but it sure tastes like time and tested old school recipes from way back.

Our favorite meatball is no longer great. Both of the regular red pizza and the white clam pizza are sort of tasteless. Shocked with how expensive it is. We ordered a small pie and a white clam pizza with a pitcher of beer. 3 Weeks ago, with the same order, the bill was around 90 bucks. This time, they got the new menu with new price, for the same thing we pretty much ordered every time, it was around $110. Wow, a 25% increase!

I'm not too sure how valid their claim of being the first pizzeria really is, but in any case, they deliver at least on the promise that you're going to get some good stuff.The pictures of the food are very accurate - Lombardis' prides itself on thinner crust, fresh products, brick oven style pizza. Their menu is a little on the small side, but I don't have any complaints. They know what they're good and that's okay with me. Service was awesome, specifically the hosts. Very accommodating, patient, and kind.My only only wish is that they start taking credit card. But I mayyy just let it slide just because it's Lombardis.

We were seated in an area where people can run back and pick up carry-out orders, so it was a bit busy and not very relaxing. Tables are small, man oh man. Think middle school lunch tray with a leg supporting it.Started off with breadsticks. Just alright. Really thick too so don't pile 'em in or you'll have no room for pizza.Fiancee and I went with the margherita pizza, half-pepperoni. Came out fairly quickly. Crust was cooked right, it wasn't falling apart trying to eat it. You can use your hands without any problem.Fiancee said she liked it, but I wasn't really big on it. Tasted very plain. No flavor popped out and I wasn't craving the next bite or anything.Table next to us ordered meatballs then I remembered reading the meatballs here were good. I asked our waitress if I could get a few to try. She said it's $5. I just wanted one, come on. Nope. BUT, if you order meatballs on your pizza it's $2. Hmm, that makes sense. I told her well bring some out, throw em on the pizza and charge me $2. Nope. Fine, I quit.Really disappointing experience as everyone seems to rave about this place.

So when I sat down and began checking the other patrons slices I did get a little worried, most looked crisp and hard....Even after my skepticism, Lomardi's does it right!  When I folded over that giant soft slice and took a huge bite I was immediatly giving 2 thumbs up. And after four more slices nearly had to be rolled out. My boyfriend even mentioned he now has to give up any other pizza, because no others could stand up against Lombardi's.Also, the Italian soda's are delicious!

3659,Raymond N.,0,5,"Lombardi's Pizza is the best in NYC (possibly anywhere), hands down! Raised in New York, I think it is fair to say we are the best judges when it comes to good pizza. And Lombardi's Pizza is a must visit whether you live in New York or just here on vacation. Bring cash. This place doesn't accept credit cards. They don't take reservations so be smart and get there before the lunch/dinner rush. Place is very cozy in nature. They expanded into the store next to it years ago. I prefer the back area, where you actually get to walk around the kitchen and see just how fresh the ingridents are! Keep the order simple. Get that basil, get that sausage, get that pepperoni and mushrooms! I'm not a crust person, but they make it just right...not too much dough and not too thick. Sauce is fresh and not from a can, it doesn't have that sour taste like most pizza joints. The freshly sliced mozzarella is simply awesome. If you happen to run into a long line, wait for it! It is worth it. And after your meal, go across the street and get some rice pudding at Rice to Riches (check my review on that). It is simply heaven.",8/4/2011,119,94,4,hi52zCsl8n4B7DkKHR_1qw
3660,Danny P.,0,4,"Although Lombardi is pretty good, I gave it four stars because after you eat it, you're not amazed, it leaves no lasting impression. The pizza is good and you can tell it is made from quality ingredients. The tomato sauce taste fresh and sweet, the mozzarella cheese is extra chewy and accompanies the tomato sauce very well. The crust is crispy. However, they did not put enough cheese, some parts were covered while some were not; at times I felt like I was eating a pizza with no toppings. If the pizza had more cheese, and I had cheese with every single bite, It would taste amazing and I would probably give it 5 stars.",6/18/2013,847,179,59,-iVJY50bRfmFWUAG1adpiQ

I came here at 11:30pm on New Years Eve and immediately got a table. We ordered a pitcher of sprite and a whole pie of their famous pizza. The pizza was thick and cheesy!!! The crust was crispy and filled with garlic and herbs! Lombardi's is a restaurant you must visit when you are in New York.,1/26/2011,47,153,286,aYXTpsVMNQ-Vf1_bTaF26A

3667,Iris C.,0,2,"We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated as there were a lot of people on their list. We were called and were escorted to the basement where we had our table. We sat down and the waitress (who was nice) came up and asked for our order. We were browsing their the menu and weren't sure if we wanted to order bruschetta or not but we figured we ask for our drinks first and in the meantime decided. However, the waitress told us that of we wanted pizza to let her know asap because they were going to shut off the ovens and if we took any longer we would have to wait for our food even longer (another 35 min or so she said). We ordered a small cheese pie, meatballs, and 2 waters. The meatballs came really fast and immediately then the pizza (less than 5 minutes) which obviously means the pizza was probably sitting already made. We never even got our drinks until my husband pointed out to one of the guys who was around. Our waitress was the only one attending that entire basement and running around going up & down the stairs to get everyone's food. As we ate our not so hot pizza, I noticed that The tables were turning really quickly as the waitress had told all of us there earlier about the oven being shut down. 2 couples next to us sat down as we wee about finished and now greeted by another waiter and never did any of those tables told about the oven being shit down and them having to rush pizza order in - so makes me wonder if the waitress was not being honest and wanting to turn her tables as soon as possible for her own benefit? We were in in that restaurant testing our lunch for no more than 20 min so the oven must have not stopped working as everyone else kept on getting their pizza. Either way, the pizza was good my husband liked the meatballs but the overall experience was not that great- not very friendly, felt rushed and just wanted out of that basement. I have had better pizza in NY down on Bleecker street and not only is that other pizza  a lot better (the best if u ask me) but the ambiance and service as well. Lombardi's $35 for a small pizza with the service received was not worth it. We will not be coming back here.",9/6/2015,54,32,14,jY2QpMUI9QAfr2kvrPyYhw

3669,Vincent R.,0,5,"To start off, the service was great! Historic and popular restaurants sometimes think they are doing you a favor by letting you eat at their establishment, therefore being rude and negligent. Lombardi's did nothing of the sort. To get to the good stuff, their pizza was phenomenal. With ovens from the early 1900's (either 1904 or 1905), and an establishment to match, Lombardi's is able to create some of the best pizza in the world. The sauce has such a fresh taste, as does the dough, cheese and basil, that when all of the ingredients are combined, a master piece is formed. Whether you are a tourist or native New Yorker, do everything you can to make it to Lombardi's to taste excellence and experience history.",2/2/2012,3,27,1,3AE9jQDIWOkLEob3j13BGQ
3670,Robert K.,0,4,"As the sign outside says, this has been designated a landmark institution and is recognized as the first pizzeria in America.  Is that important to you?  If so, eat at Lombardi's.  Is good pizza important to you?  If so, eat at Lombardi's.  Is getting a New York-style pizza experience important to you?  If so...Do not eat Lombardi's.  Let me explain:We went here on the last day of our trip, found it through Yelp! Mobile, and I had it bookmarked, I think because of its historical attributes and the positive reviews.  I did not realize it was a sit-down restaurant - I had to go back and check out of the hotel and catch a train, and I just wanted a slice to fold up and grab and go, true NY-style.  Well, it's sit down only, and the pizza is authentic Italian wood-fired pizza.  Not what you get on the corner once every 3 blocks.  Not a thick layer of greasy cheese on top of a metal oven baked pizza.  Great pizza?  Yes.  True NY-fashion pizza?  No.So, if you want to sit down, enjoy the ambiance, have a pie or two with some family and friends, and enjoy your day, by all means stop here and then tell your friends about it later.  But if you need to grab and go or you want the true NY pizza that you can only get in New York (trust me, there are many imitators, some that even come very close, but nothing is like NY-style pizza when you're actually eating it in NY) go somewhere else.  Yes, it may be hard to find reviews for these places via Yelp, because quite frankly they are probably open and close places, one every 3 blocks, each one better than the next....But really, you can't go wrong if you skip the 99cent pizza or the high-end places like this, and settle for that in-between, semi dank, working man's pizza joint down the block.",6/19/2011,148,461,207,ccjoL-gEBKBXiOApHn2Bhw

Recommended toppings: Garlic spinach with sausages, Pepperoni & fresh mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes with extra mozzarella cheeseI do have to say that it's a bit pricey (large pie= $20.50) with each topping $3 in addition to the price of the pizza---it's a place I'll go once in a while, not every week.I highly recommend avoiding weekends & nights since minimum wait could be up to an hour or more.  I did go to Lombardi's at 4pm on a Friday one time, and I got seated right away (it was my first time not having to wait!). Side Note: I think it's a slightly better than Grimaldi's Pizza in Brooklyn--but ONLY slightly better.

3692,Joshua K.,0,4,"America's first pizzeria does not disappoint. Still equipped with the same brick oven from 1905, Lombardi's offers some of the best pizza this city has to offer. The decor resembles something out of the set of the Godfather and although it's a 20 minute wait for a party of two, the agony of waiting is well worth it. The only downside is the restaurant is pressed for space, but you will probably be too busy digging into your pizza to notice the discomfort. I started off with the breadsticks and marinara sauce which was the weakest thing on the menu. The breadsticks tasted as if they were microwaved and the marinara sauce was an inch away from being classified as ketchup. But then came the pizza which was half cheese and half olive. The crust was crunchy and the mozarella was fresh, which provided the perfect balance. The tomato sauce tasted as if it was homemade and the olives added a more Mediterranean feel to the pie. Even though my party ordered a small pizza, it was good enough for 5 people. This place does not skimp on rations at all. While the breadsticks were poorly done, Lombardi's redeemed itself through its pizza. I would have loved to order desert and some coffee, but Lombardi's does not serve desert.

3699,Paul K.,0,5,"Look, when it comes to food, there can't be many people in New York City who are easier to please than I am.  I'm the guy who's impressed when someone cooks with an ""exotic"" ingredient such as a shallot or uses fresh herbs instead of dried and packaged.  My friends do consider me a ""foodie"" but I've mainly earned that title due to quantity consumed, not quality.  Basically, I'm just a fat guy.  If it tastes good, I like it.  I'm not concerned with fancy presentation, I don't believe in ""eating with your eyes first"", and I don't care what exotic preparation methods went in to creating some ""edible work of art"".  I eat out a lot, but I don't bother reviewing some of the higher-end restaurants on Yelp because I pretty much like everything.This is not true, however, when it comes to my standards in pizza.  There are pitiably few categories of life in which I am an expert, but when it comes to pizza, I am a goddamn connoisseur, monocle and all.  I've eaten more pizza in a year than the average person has seen in a lifetime, and bottom line is, Lombardi's serves one of the best pies in New York City, which is saying a lot.  The crust is thin, with the perfect balance between crispy- and chewy, a little charred and smokey from the fantastic coal oven.  The sauce is tangy and a little sweet, with the wilting basil adding its fresh flavor, and the cheese is bubbly, oozing deliciousness. This isn't one of the best pizzas in Glendale, Arizona.  New York is really known for 3 foods.  Bagels, Jewish Deli, and Pizza.  Pizza being the main thing.  I know I may come off as the typical snobbish New Yorker who believes his city is the best city and yadda yadda but it's not true.  I love NYC, but it doesn't have the best of everything.  It DOES however, have the best pizza.  I've had pizza all around the world (including Italy) and they've all fallen a bit short.  Maybe it really does have something to do with the water here, I don't know.  Some people have written Lombardi's off as a ""tourist trap"" but in my opinion that's lunacy.  When something has been around over 100 years, it's a piece of history, which of course will attract tourists.  But it had to be doing something right for the first 80 or so years to last that long, and Lombardi's hasn't changed a thing.",7/1/2013,1,23,2,7iaiKTOLqasvXjQxLSg_7Q

Surprisingly not greasy either, because often when it's this good, it needs a plate durable enough to withstand all of the oil, not a problem here. Great pizza, helpful, friendly and efficient service too.",3/10/2013,169,274,2,MNJs3-IrFWvO_poZlAVTWw

3703,Robert M.,0,3,"I think Lombardi's is essentially a 2 Brothers with a coal oven, excess seating and a hostess with a microphone. It's decent/good pizza though admittedly, I'm no pizza connoisseur. The pie slices I ate didn't seem like anything special to me in comparison to a lot of other pizza slices I've consumed from mom and pop pizza shops in NYC which use gas powered ovens. Anyways, we ordered a handful of pizzas and I decided to be a douche and plucked an anchovy off a piece of pizza from one pie and it was nasty and overwhelmingly salty. In fact, that anchovy was like putting a tablespoon of salt in your mouth. Thinking that I may have gotten a bad piece, I downed some water and tried again later. Wrong move. Those anchovies ruined an otherwise good pizza. My friends...I don't know. They were digging that nastiness and finished the pie.The lower dining area is vastly better than the area on the 2nd level. I felt like I stepped back into the 80's after dining upstairs. Customer service was adequate and attentive. Overall, I probably won't go back again. Sometimes I see lines wrapping around the corner and wonder why people don't just walk over to Ray's on Prince Street or up to 2 Brothers in St. Marks for some $1 slices. They don't accept credit cards either. You would think that being such a big restaurant, they'd be ok with taking a small hit in merchant fees, but I guess they want to stick it to the tax man.",1/2/2014,7,23,0,TQxKIHZb1zAnSq8dgvt1BQ

3706,Aaron B.,0,4,"Lombardi's. THE first official pizzeria in the U.S. Of course I had to check it out. They don't sell slices, so make sure you bring a friend. They don't take reservations unless your a large party (and that doesn't always apply on the weekends). The menu is pretty straight forward. I like to stick to the traditional flavors, pepperoni, sausage or their white (which is what they're known for) or cheese with fresh garlic. Pies come out quick and are oh so delicious. As with pizza in a restaurant, always let it ""settle"" for a minute or two, so that one; you don't burn your mouth and two; the toppings won't fall off, being that they are fresh.This place is cash only.It is expensive to grab a pie ($20-$24 for a large no toppings) and the service can be sporadic and no re-fills on RC soda (hence the 4 stars) but it is a delicious pizza. But, if your feeling adventurous, head over the bridge and hit up the OTHER #1 ranked pizza in the city, Grimaldi's. Much cheaper.",4/24/2014,1,14,0,PEoDSwvql0-PJ02ktfPknQ

Tons of pictures of celebs (Jack Nicholson, Joe DiMaggio, etc.) who have frequented the establishment and give it the NY seal of approval.

And I'm talking hole-in-the wall all the way to michelin rated restaurants.The sauce is fresh, not smelling of sour tomato paste, and overall delicious. The cheese is perfectly proportioned (don't go for the white pizza as they overdo the cheese) and the toppings are top-notch. In fact, it's EXTREMELY cheap when you think about the quality of the food you're getting. My only complaint is I enjoy perhaps a slightly thinner crust. The crust itself has a delicious flavor (not something I can say for most) that easily rival's Frank Pepe's crust from New Haven. Go here. It's worth the wait.

You can't go wrong with ordering a plain pie, and if you are adventurous add as many toppings as you like. If you ask me, I would say just to get the plain pie to really get a taste for the fresh ingredients. I've never gotten anything but a large pie, and it is enough for 3 very hungry people, and 4 sort-of hungry people. (Once I got it for just two, and we only could conquer half of the pie.) The house salad is also great, comes with a classic Italian dressing that is delicious and fresh. I'm a fan of putting a bit of salad on top of my pizza, and the italian dressing on the salad, all plopped on top of the pizza makes for an even more delectable bite. Overall, you can't go wrong with this pizza spot. Moreover, it is in a cool area in downtown Manhattan, on Spring street, and although it is a little bit off the beaten path for shopping, it is well worth a bit of a walk from Broadway to stop in for some stellar 'za.

Liicensed by the city of new york in 1905, as the first OFFICIAL pizzeria of America.An original pizza, size: large has 8 slices, 18 inches and the original is 19.50.  The small at 14 inches, has six slices and is 15.50.  There is a long list of toppings which can rack up the $ as they range from 1 topping (3.00) - 5 toppings (8.00).  Another popular pizza is the White Pizza which is composed of mozzarella, ricotta cheese, romano cheese, garlic infused oil and no red sauce (AKA tomato sauce).  The prices are slightly higher as the large (same dimensions and slice count) is 21.50 and the small is 17.50.  There are personal calzones as well for 11.95, topping options are consistent with the pizza. It's a place every New Yorker and foreigner should try - the classic, thin crust, non greasy, originator of the New York style pizza and then compare the rest throughout the greater areas- the pepperoni is authentic pepperoni slices- thick, juicy, and tasty... the pizza is not as greasy as Grimaldi's in Brooklyn but definitely comparable in flavor.It's also a perfect location for those wearing your walking shoes- plenty to do in the area- from shopping, bars, dessert, and experiencing the essence of NYC.There can and will be a wait on the weekends so pick your time slot wisely.  There is a bar where you can wait and enjoy drinks as you are tightly packed like a can of sardines with the other hungry pizza lovers.By the way:There is a free delivery area that blankets the Financial District, Tribeca, SOHO, the Lower East Side, and the East and West Village.  Take advantage.Costco pizza, step aside....",7/21/2010,30,15,15,7RZLdkt5NvHYlfENBTuIFw

Let me preface my review with the fact that my grandparents owned a pizza shop for over 45years. One in which I grew up making pizza dough by hand and learning the ways of the lasagna. With that said, I can tell you that yes the dough is good, it is made from scratch the old fashioned way but I can also tell you that the black bits on the bottom of the crust is not wood burning fire ash but the result of a dirty oven being used to cook the pizzas. I can also tell you that the pizza sauce is straight out of a large no flavor bargain basement Smart and Finals tin can! The only portion of the ""in house made"" Sangria was that the twist top to the bottle was opened in house. (I make Sangria as a hobby and have visited Spain enough times to know what Sangria should taste like). I only had a glass and had an instantaneous head ache afterwards that lasted all night. The plastic plates were unclean and as I walked to to the restroom partly through the prep station I saw the $9 salad being made that looked less appetizing then the one in the McDonald salad in a cup. Only pizza that is worst comes from Chucky Cheese or Bowling Alleys.Oh and lets not start with the ATM attached to the building because the restaurant only takes cash gag... This place is historic for me but not for pizza but its ability to fool people into thinking that this is ""good"" pizza.",8/24/2012,83,82,17,BgM7ycCyNKAl1kdG2YRzvw

I did realize though, that I absolutely adore this place and their pies.The service is always top notch when I dine here. Maybe I've been lucky, maybe not.

I wouldn't eat here that often since paying $30 for a single pie reeks of rip-off but I can't deny that it has a nice balance between the thin crust, light marinara, and high quality meats/cheese/basil. It's best to eat piping hot out of the coal oven since these slices don't hold up well to-go. At a more reasonable price point, I'd up the rating but it simply isn't really worth it.

The restaurant itself was surprisingly large and somewhat like a maze to navigate through but the ambiance was great it really allows you to enjoy your food.

3784,Dan S.,0,3,"Have heard lots of great things about Lombardi's so I couldn't wait to try it when I was it town a few days ago.I was a bit put off when I walked up with all of the ""first pizza"" and ""we started it all"" hype on the awnings. I started to wonder if this place might be all hype and a trying to live up to past glory type of place like PInk's Hot Dogs here in LA.Fortunately, it wasn't all hype, though perhaps over-hyped slightly. Granted this was only my first time there but it seems like this place suffers a bit from drinking it's own Kool-Aid.Don't get me wrong, it was a pretty good pie, not amazing but I enjoyed it. I got a small with mushrooms and pepperoni. The crust was great but typical for NYC pies (NYC water definitely gives it a unique flavor). The sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes was good, but left me thinking that the tomatoes were likely canned and possibly domestic. The best thing about the pie is they use real mozzarella and that makes a big difference in flavor. At the end of the day it was a pretty tasty pie, but nothing extra special.One gripe is that the pie didn't cook evenly as part of the bottom was a bit soggy which put me off slightly. Seems like the place is so busy that they might have rushed my pizza out of the oven or maybe there was moisture on the pan. Not sure but it did bother me a bit.Happy I went but I'd only come back if I was in the area craving a pie. Not worth more than a 10 minute walk.",11/10/2010,176,24,3,xOgnCHftgfyj09AvkNtQVA

Honestly I expected a little more out of the pizza because I've heard so many good things about the pizza here, but perhaps I was expecting too much. Either way it was very good regardless and definitely worth trying.Most importantly of all, the history surrounding this restaurant just amazes me.

I'm not a heavy meat eater but for this I will break the rules. The service is aaaaahmazing!! You will feel welcome, you will feel like a true New Yorker. Sometimes you will wait but hey your getting an authentic pizza not a generic scientific pizza like at little ceasers or Jerry's. The crust....omg it's light and airy.. It's crispy and bubbly!! I told the dude that I wanted a bubbly crust and he looked at me as if he was that dog from Lady and the tramp and I was lady...he was like for you I make special for you Bellisma...I was like well okay...papi!!  He brought out our pizzas and then he was like u need anything u let me know mami....the cheese stretch for miles, the sauce reminded me of grandmas recipe.

The first pizza restaurant to open up in the states was definitely on my touristy agenda. My friends and I were seated right away but in the back room. It wasn't too busy for late afternoon on a Saturday (considering what I've heard about the line going down the street.) The staff was pleasant, the restaurant was cozy and relatively quiet. We ordered a small, half regular/half spinach and garlic pie. The sauce was sweet, the mozzarella was fresh and stretching from my plate to my mouth, and the spinach with garlic was on point. It was probably one of the best pizza's I've ever had! Mind you, there is a serious pizza drought in Southern New Hampshire... We have too many deep dish and Greek pizza places around here... I personally savor the ""NY style"" thin crust. Pricing was comparable to Bertuccis -a tad overpriced for the quantity but worth every penny for the quality.

Honestly, the pizza wasn't the best I've ever had. Don't get me wrong. It was good, but not THAT good and I will probably never return.",6/25/2010,103,478,31,PEBErFLrFUuLXtTwamcGQA

I didn't like that it was a bit soggy towards the center (maybe because of the vegetable juices), but the crust was delicious. Service was a bit bleh so if I could, I would give it 3.5 but I give it half a star since I didn't have to wait.",7/12/2011,107,273,0,IFYkRXw4DwrXqPyLptOaAA

Some have good cheese or good sauce or good crust.  Very few can get the whole package down, at least to my taste.Well this place is now in the category of my personal favorites!  There is a reason to keep a coal oven for a 105 years!   Simple and perfect tastes.   Just wonderful!",8/16/2010,2,23,0,EyEP4bc1RugabCFx8-p8nA

I love my some pizza and it was a huge treat for me to try out the very first historical pizza joint. We waited for less than an hour for 3 people. We went during non peak times too! But nevertheless, there was still a wait. But it wasn't that bad at all. Inside is pretty tiny but the ambiance is pretty cool. Service wasn't bad and the food arrived faster than expected. They told us it would take 30 minutes for it to cook but I think it was actually 20 minutes. For 3 of us we ordered one large pizza with 2 toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms) and one pitcher of coke and the total cost was $33. Not bad people! That's like $11 each and this is considered cheap in NYC!The pizza itself was super delicious. You can taste the quality of each ingredient. This is NOT New York style pizza by any means so please don't be mistaken. It is definitely Napolitano style pizza. But man this pizza was delicious and well worth the wait.

I liked both kinds.  We were hungrier than expected, so then we ordered a small pizza--half meatballs and mushroom, and white with spinach.  No one seemed to like the white pizza- it was by far way toooooo cheesy for any of us. eck!Atleast now we know what to order..haha! stick with the pizza that HAS tomato sauce! unless you LOVE LOVE cheese to the max.",4/13/2011,102,329,1,mXYVc5jgShblQZKfGf4DmQ

We liked our pie. The garlic spinach, I think, made the pizza. Sauce was flavorful and plentiful. The crust  to us was good and I didn't notice anything burnt. But I like it a little char anyway. Service was nice and adequate. My only gripe is no soda refills. You have to buy it by the can or pitcher. That's just bullshit. Your bill will be a moderate amount so remember the cash, b/c that's all they take.All this talk about best pizza in the City and what not...I don't know about all that. Depending on you it's good or very good. Also not sure if it's worth waiting for an hour or so for a table. Tourist trap perhaps.

3834,Shirley H.,0,4,"This place is TOURISTY, and Lombardi really plays up the fact that they were the first pizza joint (or so they claim). But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the pizza here, especially when they offer half off their plain margheritas, something that seems to happen often enough. My mom and I ordered a small margherita (6 pieces), which fed us comfortably, and added mushrooms and meatballs. While certainly not the most delicious pizza I've ever had (that distinction goes to American Flatbread in Vermont), you can't really go wrong. They know how to make a crispy crust and don't overdo it on the tomato sauce or cheese. The homemade meatballs are also delicious. I highly recommend it as a topping. Overall, the pizza is a little bland for my taste, though. I don't think I could eat it without some sort of meat and a lot of chili flakes. Two more good things I have to say about this place: First, I like the simplicity of the menu. It kind of implies that Lombardi's tries to do a few things well versus doing a lot of things mediocrely, and the former is how I prefer to roll. Second, they have a large dining space and a fast turnover rate. I guess it's not really a place where people come to enjoy four hour meals. We came on half off day at 5:30 and were seated 15-20 minutes later, which I would say is impressive. In the end, I think we ended up paying around $14 for the two of us, which was by far the cheapest non-food-cart meal I had this past weekend in New York.

The ingredients are so fresh you could literally taste everything... one ingredient didn't overpower the other.  The bread/crust is so thin it's almost like you weren't even eating bread... WOW!  The menu is simple, the pizza comes in a few sizes ith some standard toppings, pay extra to add a few more - and done!  We paid $20 all together for everything (TIP INCLUDED) and for a sit down place that was pretty reasonable to me!I wish Lombardi's came to San Diego, I'd be here every week!",2/18/2011,99,533,669,NV7Iqq3yQEN1_WWt5qDsCQ

Just sat down instantly. We ordered a bottle of wine (it was the house Italian wine), salad, and a small pizza with wild mushrooms, red onions, and sausage on it. The salad and the wine was pretty normal. Nothing too special about it. I tried the pizza, and at first it was pretty bland.. I put red chili pepper on it.. nope still bland.. I added Parmesan cheese and it made it better but still did not hit the spot... So we asked for extra tomato sauce. When we ordered it, the waiter looked at us like ""how offensive"". I smothered my pizza with the sauce, and yep it hit the spot. I like how they sliced the sausage instead of cutting it into large chunks. I also liked the dough because it was nice and gooey. The crust was a little large and too crispy for my taste.. I usually don't like the crust, so I felt like it was a waste of pizza since the crust was over 1 inch wide.

3864,Trina S.,0,2,This place was okay.  I got the margherita pizza and half with their house made meatballs.  It wasn't memorable or anything.  Actually...I take that back.  The sauce was very memorable but they literally put like 2 pieces of mozzarella on my half that didn't have any meat.  What gives??  I know they probably don't want to overpower the thing with cheese but it wouldn't have killed to add 2 more or something.  It was good but not like I would go out of my way to go back there or anything.,1/29/2013,41,114,27,aOOrCrkMvRlV-0bOBsPRKw

I left my black Prada sunglasses on that flat top portion of the bottom floor(where the whine is) bathrrom.  WHO TOOK IT! i went in there when we got seated... then realized i didn't have them after we paid =/   remembered where i left them, went to go the bathroom..and it was gone!  i woulda thought someone would have said something being a small place below if someone left this here, ALSO being that majority of folks there did not look like thief material... but i guess, prada sunglasses are prada sunglesses... ugh.  please return? miracle if so... if finder sees this yelp =P",6/4/2011,32,44,146,tpDeqcWkcddbVnl4M3KT-w

3868,Amanda C.,0,4,"I'm consistently surprised by the supposed superiority of New York Style pizzas. I find them to be rather flat and dense. As someone who prefers a thin inner crust with a puffy, bread-like outer crust, NY pizza strikes me as very flat. Lombardi's is one of the kings of NY Pizza. They do it very well and with good quality ingredients. But the skimping of cheese, secondary prioritization of crust, and overall adherence to the NY style makes me like them- NOT love them. NB. I think less native New Yorkers eat here than tourists. Lombardi's dining room resembles Disney's ""It's A Small World"": 30 different language being spoken by a global population, all with guidebooks in hand. For some reason, it annoys me greatly. I don't even care if that makes me intolerant. It's just the way it is. Give me a locals joint any day.",5/18/2010,444,690,59,HpyiJBzaloUGH7wOaQchyQ
3869,Ilyssa R.,0,5,"My Jewish boyfriend and I believed in Jesus Christ the day we ate Lombardi's pizza as recommended by the Mensch on our tourbus...Can I even explain to you how it feels to have cheese, that is already melted, coat and caress and slide down the back of your tongue and the crisp yet chewy crust and not-too-overdone sauce cover the roof of your mouth? A part of me died knowing I was leaving NYC to come back to my Papa John's in California the next day.",9/14/2010,141,113,20,hNhOidHrbXbMykPOSGlyRg
3870,Nan K.,0,3,"Nothing special at all.  Very pricey.  Decor probably hasn't changed since its founding in 1909.  If we hadn't traveled to get here, we would have left, since it looks rather seedy; although, some might find that atmospheric.  Pizza came quickly, but service was poor and food was expensive.  If you want to pay these prices, go to Marta for something really tasty and a much better setting.  At Lombardi's they nickel and dime you for everything.  Nothing fine or gracious about it.  Btw, cash only.",8/21/2015,0,6,0,9GmbuapMqSY2BcNwvDqIhg

3872,Flora R.,0,3,"""Ze best pizza in ze world!"" says the signage all over the place.After being deterred on previous visits to New York, I finally decided to sit out the wait and give it a go this time. Maybe Saturday night around dinner time was not the best time to give in. The wait, though promised only 30 minutes, was a lot closer to an hour to seat us. However, that hour gave us plenty of time to look over the options and as soon as we sat down, in a quiet booth removed from the hustle of the front room, we put in our order. The waitstaff was friendly but rushed throughout. Our drinks, apps and pizza came out in quick succession and while I'm not sure it was worth the starving hour wait, that was some pretty good pizza. Thin crust, smooth tomato sauce and lovely hunks of mozzarella and bits of basil all over - yum. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs so half a pizza went home with us and ended up being a great morning snack the next day. I would definitely eat this pizza again, however maybe next time I'll go for takeout to avoid the starving wait in their small entryway or cold benches outside.",2/14/2011,27,180,2,hXkSbD9yEP-Gw4dFQbKfkQ
3873,Shirley C.,0,5,"I absolutely LOVE this place! The pizzas are very thin and are so delicious that you'll eat the whole pie before you realize you're full already. I've had both Grimaldi's and Lombardi's pizza and what makes me choose Lombardi as the best pizza in New York is their friendly and family atmosphere. The wait staff is very kind and attentive and will never rush you to leave (like Grimaldi's), even if you've been there for 2 hours already. I've also organized a birthday dinner here for 20 people and we were given a private room on an upper level. We had to share the room with another birthday group but we didn't mind because everyone was having such a good time. I would definitely recommend this place for a casual dinner with your family or friends, to go here on a date, or to organize a birthday dinner here :)",3/13/2011,171,93,15,TIHajDK9Zd-N-WzcBX2npg
3874,Daiki N.,0,2,"Went here with co-workers yesterday. I wasn't surprised at all considering all the hype. Maybe back in the day this place had better quality pizza. I've definitely had better pizza, but I will also say that everyone has their different preferences on a pizza, it just wasn't my fit. I came late so finding my table was difficult. I didn't know there was a room leading to another room, leading to the kitchen, then up the stairs to finally finding my colleagues. Very confusing. The place was packed with people and tourists. We ordered 2 large pies and 1 small pie. All of them were so-so. The crust was a bit chewy and the cheese fall right off. There wasn't a whole lot of toppings considering the decent price.",4/21/2011,135,63,1,wgtxbI-uAzQ5RFhiB2w09g
3875,Sarah S.,0,5,"Hands down my favorite pizza in New York. Be warned--if you want NY style pizza, this isn't it. Lombardi's makes a Napoli (Naples)-style pizza. That means tasty sauce, large chunks of cheese thrown on (not completely covering pizza), and not at all greasy.Lombardi's is everything that traditional NY style pizza isn't. In my opinion, NY style pizza is flavorless and too greasy. So, pretty much Lombardi's is perfection, because it is neither. I have only ever ordered their pizza margarita, so I can't really say anything about their other pizzas. But the pizza margarita is seriously tasty.",5/6/2010,21,71,10,A0RY3g_DCe2Jd13P3X2Obg
3876,Lori E.,0,1,"Very bland, unimpressive pizza. Giving it a low rating because there are so many incredible places to get pizza in the city, and we found this to be very disappointing.

It was nice to try eating here, but I don't think I'll be coming back to this place again. Lastly, I think this place is a total tourist trap and an over-priced one. It's totally not worth the hype.

3880,Alex C.,0,3,"Pizza is pizza, right?  Simple to make a good solid pizza? WRONG!A good pizza requires precise amounts of cheese and tomato sauce, with adequate dough, which isn't too chewy, but isn't too burnt and the right toppings which add to the natural taste of the pizza without taking away from it.With that being said, I ordered an italian sausage, tomato and basil pizza, which usually never fails.  However, the italian sausage was a little bland, lacking in the zest of the usual sausage spices, there was insufficient amount of basil, having an occasional strip here and there and the crust was a little thicker than I would have preferred.  However, the tomatos were quite juicy and tastiful (a combination of tasty and wonderful).With a little more basil and a thinner crust, this would be a much better pizza.  The italian sausage was just kind of a lost cause and should be tossed out all together.",11/30/2012,3,24,0,u2B8fuIPdcky37xfMK6z1g

3882,U K.,0,3,"3.5 starsIn town for a few days from SF, my sister wanted to treat me to some worthwhile dining experiences after all the raving I had done about food in the Bay Area. As an avid watcher of the travel channel and it's many pizza-centric programs, I've become fairly well-versed in NY pizza history, and felt obligated to check out Lombardi's - (supposedly) America's first pizzeria. Thankfully, my sister hadn't been there before, and was a bit curious to try it for herself.As a pizza fiend, I really wanted to give Lombardi's a higher rating, but given the hype built around this place, I was left pretty disappointed. My sister and I split a Margherita (is there a better benchmark?), and while it was a good pie, it certainly was nothing otherworldly. Personally, we both felt it was a little too light on the sauce, and could've used a bit more basil, and maybe even olive oil.My sister felt so bad  about both of our dissatisfaction that she treated me to Motorino's the following night to make up for it.Other than the food, the atmosphere was very pleasant. The ambiance was nice, and the place not too crowded. Service was polite and quick. My favorite part of the experience was getting to check out the famed oven while walking through the kitchen to get to our table.Tip: Come in around 7 on a weekday and there's no wait -- which I would think is the only time worth checking this place out.",9/24/2010,2,27,1,3P-5sAQoAyKcoO5e4paG7Q

My brother and I usually get the original pizza - fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, romano and fresh basil. So simple, so delicious. Besides the taste, the quality of everything they use in their pizza is so fresh. I've also tried the clam pizza, which was pretty good considering clams? on a pizza??

(think they rest the dough for at least a day).So why 4 stars?...as we were heading out and I was planning on a 3 star, I overhead one of the wait staff ordering his own pie...""extra well done"".  I stopped, and asked,,,why?  ""I like a crispy crust""..voila!  Now I need to go back next time and order it that way...maybe a 5 star is in the future.Either way, great place, great ambiance.  Its  a New York Staple!Oh, but bring cash!  No credit cards",5/24/2010,11,67,3,ccUOg80hnETeT35Bz1eGAQ

3907,Paul T.,0,4,"I hear many things about Lombardi's Pizza, and one of them is ""it's not as good as it use to be"".  I honestly don't know what that means. I have been eating Lombardi's Pizza for the past 10 years, and in my opinion, it hasn't changed much at all.  Perhaps, it has changed from inception, but that could be explained through the changing of generational hands that are now making it.  No two people could make an exact recipe and taste the same.  It just doesn't happen.  I find Lombardi's to be, one of the best representations of ""New York Style Pizza."" in all of New York.You have a perfectly charred crust that holds it's own to some wonderful toppings.  It's a little bit of salty; firm yet chewy, and good to the last bite.  The balance between the cheese, the sauce, and the additional toppings are excellent.  In addition to great pizza, Lombardi's offers a range of good Italian American food, such as the perfectly cooked Baked Clams or Fried Calamari.The space itself is great.  Old school classic pizzeria with an extended dining room, that also leads to the upstairs, which is not very comfortable.  The staff is pleasant and informative.  The place is busy and no one should expect to be seated right of way.This is in due part to it's history. New York is the birth place of the Neapolitan pizza, New York Style, thanks to Lombardi's introduction back in 1887.It's a lively place to grab some good old fashioned style New York Pizza.",7/5/2011,79,58,3,-vzh6NHPxXXBQaOGJtXySQ
3908,Toni R.,0,5,"Went to New York for the first time, and of course, the one food you know you need to try in this city is pizza. So why not go for the best? Lombardi's Pizza is famous for it's history of being the first pizza place in the US, but not only that, it's been ranked one of the best pizza's in New York.I'm from California and love eating pizza, but California pizza has nothing on this place. Lombardi's pizza is simply the best pizza ever. And I do notice the different styles of pizza. I've been to Italy, and had real authentic Italian pizza, but Lombardi's pizza New York style pizza is like comparing apples to oranges, their some kind of difference, but both are very very good.More on the pizza.. the menu didn't have any pre-made pizza's.. you actually have to build your own pizza and choose all the toppings. I tried the pancetta, with diced tomatoes and mushrooms. And it was amazing. It had the perfect amount of tomatoe sauce, the overall pizza was not too oily, and OH, the MOZARELLA is to die to for. I would love to go back to Lombardi's and order the margherita pizza with extra mozarella. (Yes, I'm a cheese lover)My experience at Lombardi's was great. I heard about how packed it is during the typical lunch hours, so my friends and I went at around 3 or 4pm and their was no wait at all. The hostess was nice. And our waiter was so friendly, helpful, and down to earth. It was obvious we were tourist because we were taking pictures all over the place. Sometimes this may seem embarassing or even annoying to locals. But our waiter, without us even having to ask, offered to take a picture of us, before and after we get our pizza.So yeah, don't go when it's super packed (during lunch hours), then you will probably receive very good personal customer service.",4/5/2011,192,30,28,3Ra0D_5y82Rl6-OFje67Ug

We only added one topping, cause if I remember right, it's around $3 per topping. We added pancetta and it was DELICIOUS!  If you're looking for an overpriced,  non-greasy, but flavorful pizza, go to Lombardi's!Oh yeah, hubby left a bag of stuff we bought at a street vendor under the table, and we remembered when we were a couple blocks away, and we went back and they had it!

Why and how...?  So they charged for full price on each topping even though it was on half.  Ugh...instead of making a scene, I just paid the bill.  For pizza that was just decent compared to some of the other NY/NJ Pizza establishments, I rather spend my money wisely elsewhere.  Besides, who wants to wait an hour for mediocre pizza...this is a tourist attraction and nothing else.",6/30/2015,0,36,21,ak6MgiPquMxCELz1Xyh2tg
3916,Derek F.,0,3,"Light, Fresh, and OriginalThis was the last place I hit on my trip to NY. I remember seeing this place on the travel channel so when it was suggested to me as a staple of New York style pizza, I found myyself eager to try. Lombardis is very small and for some reason has not decided to get with the program and accept credit cards. I dont care how much business they get. Not accepting credit cards is unacceptable. I can understand not taking checks. But credit cards? Im sure they are making enough to cover the Visa & Mastercard transactions fees but anyways...Moving on...We were seated and a adolescent table....wait...what? ...that was for adults? wow...so apparently the crowd must be 5'5"" and 130lbs because the tables were tiny, and the seats were equally small. My brother and I are each over 6' and over 200lbs so you can see where a small table might not be suitable. We started off  with the breadsticks and man was that ever depressing. They werent even warm and tasted horrible. I would have been better off picking some up from the local supermarket freezer. The only thing good about the breadsticks was the sauce which i felt as if i should have just ordered a bowl of sauce and a spoon since the sauce was so good. I really was impressed by the sauce. The pizza came and needless to say that little table came back to haunt us again. We ordered a large pizza and there wasnt enough room on the table to eat from a plate. you basically had to either hold your plate or eat right from the tray. You can be the size of a 5 year old and when a large pizza is on the table you still wouldnt have any room.This was not your run of the mill pizza. This was unlike anything I had ever tasted. Half was I believe pancheta and the other half was italian sausage and pepperoni. My first bite was an explosion of flavors. Such robust, yet non overwhelming flavors. I immediately tasted the pepperoni and sausage and those were delectable. The best way I could describe this pizza is ""light."" I ate slowly to make sure I could enjoy every bite and savor all the flavors. This was not heavy and greasy like normal pizza. The pepperoni and sausage were also very light unlike other pepperoni and sausage used for toppings that are heavy and wear you down. This was very light and tasted very very fresh. There is a considerable difference between Lombardi's pizza and other pizzerias. I really enjoyed how light yet flavorful this pizza was. I would likely recommend this place to my friends if they wanted to try a fresh and authentic NY pizza. This is unlike any pizza I had before, but I would not find myself needing to have another slice everytime I went back. If youre going to charge that much for pizza at least give me enough room to enjoy it.",3/31/2011,87,101,57,rha3AO9Dae1kV67qDspf9w

3921,Rob G.,0,3,"What???!!! This place while having old world charm and a true family feel just left me surprisingly disappointed. After all the hype, about this being the best pizza place in NYC I feel like I got cheated. :( I Gave this place every opportunity to wow me too!!So here we go. We ordered a split half and half. 1 half original margarita and the second half with citterio pancetta, pepperoni, sweet Italian sausage, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes. So we wait and our pizza comes out and it looks great, piled on with toppings and u may ask, so what's the problem??? And I will tell you! First the pizza that was a magarita was more or less plain cheese pizza, no sliced tomatoes, no basil leaves. Just watery tomato sauce and a disappointed me. The second half though much more appealing with all the toppings was again just ok. All the toppigs slide off because it was too watery, the cheese was fresh mozzerella but once the chess got cold it just slid everything off the pizza and was just a disaster. I don't think I'm being too harsh considering I was blown away by another pizzeria in the east village and it was amazing. I hate to say this but I may actually prefer pizza my hearts pepperoni ad sausage to this pizza any day. The service thought on another note was very friendly, efficient and for that I gave this place an extra star. But there are better places to get a pie. Save your time and go to Artichokes Pizza!!

3931,Tiffany W.,0,4,"As first timers in New York, a trip to a pizzeria was a must for my boyfriend and I. Even though our hotel wasn't even close to here, we HAD to take a cab. It was worth a try. We already spent half of our vacation money on cabs at this point anyway, so we figured why not?The service was absolutely great. The moment we walked in, we were greeted by a very friendly and informative host who directed us straight to the bar for our wait. Plus one! HahaThe bartender was awesome as well, offering us samples since we couldn't decide on what beer to get a pitcher of. Thanks to him, we were able to make a very informative decision on which beer would taste the best in getting us super drunk on our last night in NYC.After our relatively short wait, we were directed to the bottom room, which looked like it may have been a wine cellar at some point. As many other reviewers have pointed out, it did just seem like a tourist trap, where the owner was just trying to shove as many paying customers as he could at any given moment. I can't really complain since we essentially WERE just dumb tourists, and the seating didn't really bother me.Our waiter was pretty amazing as well. He was honest, which was nice. My boyfriend and I originally wanted to put about a bajillion toppings on our pizza, and even though the waiter would've been able to rack up a huge bill from our table based purely on added toppings, he advised otherwise. He recommended that we only choose 4 toppings at the most, or else the pizza would be too soggy. He received a lot of respect from me because of that.So we finally settled on some toppings, and got meatballs on the side, as well as yet another pitcher. The meatballs were really really good. (Thanks to the two pitchers at this point? Maybe.) The pizza was also very enjoyable. (For the same reason? ...Maybe.)I wasn't that much of a fan of the one unisex bathroom in the bottom room, but luckily it wasn't too busy the entire time we were there.So the best part of the experience? The first time my boyfriend stood up after we consumed our pitchers. Walking back up the stairs proved to be too big of a task for him, and he promptly tripped up the first small set of stairs. Our waiter was a total sweetheart and continued his good service by making sure he was just fine (which he was)... probably because the fallen guy's girlfriend was too busy standing there pointing and laughing at him.All in all, a great experience full of great service, good food, and amazing company.",1/14/2011,52,27,9,lwMXeQMVE9l5zG3hjGaP8w

Now, the crust is thicker, the meatballs are cut into thirds, etc., and it's no longer as good.Even more unfortunate, are the lines of visitors waiting to get a table, all for a pizza pie that's probably mentioned in a lot of guidebooks but is a long ways away from being best in the city anymore.Try Motorino's (there's a Manhattan location, east village) or even L'asso or Emporio (down the street from Lombardi's) for less wait and better taste.",10/12/2011,1,10,0,uOG3dyFJHMKx7WXZZbbeNA

We 3 guys ordered the standard Margherita pizza to start with. To our amazement, the pizza literally came in about 6-8 minutes, hot and fresh. Wow, that was fast! It tasted great too, really fresh tasting margherita sauce that wasn't heavy but not watery. The cheese was in chunks, good portion. But the most special part of this pizza was the crust. It was a crunchy exterior with a warm and chewy interior. And not oily so no cheating with a sear effect! Delicious! Unfortunately it was thin so we were still hungry, but that's not their fault.We ordered a sausage pizza to fill us up. This one also came real fast and we started to chow down. But to our real disappointment, there were probably maybe 10-12 tiny sausage slices on the entire pizza. I mean I get it, times are tough now. But seriously? Come on! $3 for 3 oz of sausage? That's a rip anywhere, even Manhattan!Plus the pop costs $2 per glass, they fill it half with ice, and it's no refills.So to summarize, come get the pizza, it tastes great.

Luckily we arrived there just before the rush and were seated after waiting for 10 mins. Our server came to say hi to us 5 mins after we seated. She was professional but inattentive. I didn't even get her name and while we were eating she never came to check us until she brings the check. The white pizza was ok, nothing very special and kind of dry for my taste. Margarita pizza was also similar. It comes with cheese and tomato sauce but nothing else. The only good thing is they make pizza half and half and also it's kind of inexpensive. $23 for 18 inch pizza is very good price. Because of these, I was totally fine until that point.However, when I asked about the dessert menu our server told us that hey don't have any desserts. Really?!.that's ridiculous!.Especially since I wanted to make my family try some italian desserts. After that I tried to pay the bill with my debit card, but our server told us they only accept cash..Seriously?? in this techn age?? normally I don't carry much cash but somehow I got enough cash for this time..In the end, my family had the chance to try italian style pizza but we were totally unimpressed by the food and service.

Why call it a pizza? Just call it Saucy Dough or something.Speaking of sauce, if you're going to hand make the sauce, make it right. Ki complained that it was bland. I complained that it was too sweet but that's about the only thing I tasted since there was no complexity. It may as well have been from a jar.

The tight space gives the place a traditional Little Italy atmosphere with the gracious service to go with it.As with all other well known places with good food, the wait here is alittle undesirable for a native New Yorker like me who wants everything quick and on the spot, but the foodie in me says its all worth it when you take that first bite.DO: Come for the food and atmosphereDO NOT: Come with big groups",1/29/2011,265,46,25,nOaPOBZQ8_niXU1Y_5BsMw

What better place to go than Little Italy and the first pizzeria established in America.Be prepared to wait for a table because this place can be packed with people. Pass on the appetizers, which are bland and overpriced and skip straight to main course. Thin crust pizzas baked in coal ovens that can be topped with the usual, like pepperoni, to the unusual, like their specialty clam pie.The food was good, the service was always available but the best part was the authentic atmosphere. Old photographs line the walls, checkerboard table cloths, it just looks like what a pizzeria should look like.My only complaint would be the prices. I think they jack up the prices because of the demand and the fact that it's a well known tourist attraction.",10/1/2009,1,28,22,P0og27Rb8BlS6cd0rHdUkg

This is not that overly greasy, salty type of pizza that you wash down with a beer, a smile, and a subsequent food coma.  It is more like a delicate pasta dish with all the flavors coming into perfect balance.

Sauce was nicely seasoned.    The only thing I didn't care for was the loud SiriusXM music (Sinatra). It was the right music, just a tad too loud. Maybe it was up to anticipate the loud crowd for lunch?    We ate earlier than the lunch crowd to avoid the wait and the food came out fast.    Waitress never came back to check on us.

As the oldest pizzeria in the USA, it is definitely a stop for all the foodies and tourists. Luckily, we came before 7 and my party of four got a table as soon as we walked in, but our friends decided they were going to join us later so we told them we'd come back. Very nice of them to allow that as we were already seated and all. When we came back, we did have to wait a bit (although not too long). And let me jump first to the pizza. It is good but not amazing. I closed my eyes with the first bite, expecting to feel pizza heaven...but as I chewed and chewed...all I tasted was a plain old pizza. Yeah, it was good (cause I was hungry) but nothing spectacular and it's not cheap too. The Jamaican Jerk pizza at CPK is a lot better (no offense). Another thing is that they don't offer pizza by the slice but you have to buy it whole.I love NYC and I love Food. I'm glad I came to Lombardi's, but it is not nearly what it is hyped up to be.

On our recent family vacation to New York (April 2010), we planned one of our days around dinner at Lombardi's.  Although we live closer to Chicago, I am a big fan of New York pizza.  I have literally never been disappointed when grabbing a slice of pizza from a no-name shop anywhere in the city.  So we were very exited to actually go to a ""real"" pizza place in the Little Italy neighborhood.  Especially one with such tradition.We ordered 2 small pizzas (one sausage/pepperoni and one spinach/olive).  The bottom crust was soggy on both and the upper edge crust was burnt on both.  Total failure on both aspects of the crust.  The rest of the pizza was average at best.I truly think this is one of those places that people rate highly because it's cool to say that you ate at a famous place.  This was literally the worst place we ate at during our trip and for close to $80 for 2 small pizzas, 2 beers, and a salad, it was also a total rip-off.Compare this to Katz's Deli on the Lower East Side.  Another famous place to go, but where the food is actually outstanding.",4/11/2010,0,9,2,suwJkSpDsizO0lsNWLBuow

We got a regular pie too with pancetta - o man. 2 pies, 4 people, not a slice got left behind! We tore it up, The part that blew me away is their crushed red pepper, it was actually hot - I wanted to pocket it, it was the best crushed pepper!I have to go here again, even tho the wait is ridiculous - its soooo worth it!!

3982,Ki G.,0,3,"According to Susan N - she aided in my deflowerment at this long established, never before visited, pizza joint. I agree, I mean I've walked past Lombardi's for years and never actually went in to grab a famed slice. So what better thing to do on a cold Tuesday when not at work to come with a friend to order a pie. We were planning to wet our whistles as well, but weren't too impressed by the beer selection. I guess it's standard fare so we shouldn't complain. Points for the courteous, friendly and super prompt service. The pizza itself, well, the sauce was bland. Contrary to Susan, I like a lot of sauce in my pizza, which I thought was great, but it was under seasoned and the sauce to mozzarella ratio was leaning towards less cheese and more tomato. I like a lot of sauce and a gooey amount of cheese on my pie, so this was a meh for me. However, the crust was lovely for a thin crust. Crispy, chewy and flavorful. I'm glad I was finally able to pop my Lombardi's cherry, but like most first-time experiences, I don't think I'd like to do it again. Especially when I know there is better out there.

3995,Jeffrey K.,0,5,"I can finally claim that I have been to the holy trinity of pizza restaurants in New York.  Grimaldi's, DiFara's and NOW . . . finally . . . I have been to the one, the only, the original (the one that started it all) -- Lombardi's.I got there early (just prior to noon), on a business day.  I had just come from a job interview and could not pass up the chance to finally try Lombardi's.  The place was fairly quiet -- only a handful of tables were occupied when I got there.  I was alone, so I figured that I could belly up to the bar, grab a beer and a pizza -- much to my disappointment, they don't serve food at the bar, and was forced to take a table.I ordered my pizza and a coke and while I waited, I sat there and admired the news clippings, photos, etc. throughout the place and admired the antique brickwork that seemed to have been hiding an old pizza oven or fireplace which was bricked over long ago.The pizza came, and it looked and smelled a lot like a Grimaldi's pie -- which makes me happy (especially since they both use coal fired ovens).I took my first slice, bit into it and smiled.  While, in many respects, the pizza here reminds me of Grimaldi's (I found the crust, the cheese and the pepperoni to be very similar in flavor and texture), I found the sauce to be just ever so slightly different at Lombardi's.  I am not sure if it was a fresher, or had different spices in it or what -- but it was a very pleasant flavor and by no means did I find it better OR worse than Grimaldi's . . . just different.Overall the dining experience here is wonderful and a must try even if just once.  This is where it all started folks -- it is damn good and a great landmark to visit.",1/18/2010,261,412,134,jbOVoVtVXIqnhE_cp-yMnA

3998,Jim U.,0,4,"America's first pizzeria, and they have been around since 1905.  While I appreciate their effort to bring Neapolitan style pizza to America, being first doesn't mean you are the best.  I am pretty spoiled when it comes to Neapolitan pizza.  I was fortunate enough to eat at Da Michele in Napoli over the summer (the Italian birthplace of pizza), and I have had an amazing experience at Grimaldi's which I think is the best place in America for this type of pizza.  The pizza I had at Lombardi's paled in comparison, but it is still a good pizza overall.  The crust was really lovely with a slightly chewy texture.  The ingredients were all fresh and of good quality.  I appreciated the use of San Marzano tomatoes in the sauce, but overall I found the sauce to be weak.  There was not enough fresh basil to make it sing, and it faded too much in the background with the addition of only three toppings.  The pepperoni was also disappointing.  Cut razor thin, they crisped up into cones and tasted like salt.  The mozzarella was great, and the mushrooms had a great earthiness to them.  What I found to really be disappointing though was that the ingredients failed to come together into something greater than their individual parts.  Because of its history it is worth a visit, but if you are looking for the best pizza in the city, and you could do better to go elsewhere.  3.75 stars, but I will round up to 4",12/20/2009,692,1303,3044,xTGpw0x5EUj11YFhwr6m2A
3999,Alison W.,1,3,"After finally trying Grimaldi's on my last trip, I wanted to find some decent NY style pizza that was closer to the city. I still don't know if I'm a huge thin crust fun but this pizza was pretty darn good. So the place doesn't look very big but they have multiple rooms. I have a feeling they've expanded a bunch. We were stuck in a narrow hallway type area that seemed like it might used to be a foyer of a brownstone. The wait was reasonable for a Sunday night, I think - about half an hour. It was shorter than I was expecting but still longer than the hostess told us. Service was so-so. Plenty of people working and rushing around - just no one seemed to help us. Also it took extra long for our pizza to come out because another table who was seated after we ordered got their food before ours. Not sure if they messed up or thought we could wait longer to eat because we had a salad. Anyways I think we ended up with the green salad and a small pizza with meatballs. The salad was way overdressed - drenched in the dressing. And so pricey for just a bunch of leaves. The pizza though was beautiful, almost too good to eat. Hot and cheesy and lots of red sauce. Not enough meatballs for me but I think there was a few per slice. I like that the thin crust helps when you're not too hungry because it doesn't fill you up as much. I think the two of us had 4 of the 6 slices and we got the rest to take home. They were nice enough to wrap it in foil which is great because then it fit in the mini fridge at our hotel room. Oh and I guess I will end on a good note by saying the busboy ran after us when we left a bag under our table after leaving. That was nice of him.",10/9/2012,523,1908,1401,shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g

4001,Rachel S.,0,3,"I go to Lombardis once every month and it's great! Even a plain pizza with no toppings is very delicious.  The only complaint I have is the prices.  As mentioned, one pie is 26$ without topping and it's an extra 8$ or 9$ dollars for toppings. They should consider maybe having a pie of four or some other price special so that more customers can enjoy the food without paying such a hefty price. I definitely think that if the prices were more affordable that more people would visit.",6/30/2015,0,22,0,WaSYVBE1IqBjJ7XZEouCqQ
4002,Louise L.,0,4,"This was another establishment my boyfriend said we had to try. So after spending a day visiting Ms. Liberty and making a pit stop at Rice to Riches, we ""happily"" put our on on the wait list at Lombardi's. It was freezing cold outside....for a California girl...30 degrees is freezing! Luckily, we found a spot by the bar to chilax until our names were called. I think it took about 45 mins or so. The place was packed!!!!Funny story before I go on. We were staring at the pizzas of a party sitting at this table in the very corner that separates the bar and the dining area the whole time while we were waiting. My boyfriend mentioned how sucky it would be to sit there while everyone stares at you as you eat. I told him...yea it would be so annoying. He said he wouldn't want to sit there. I told him to watch out cause we're gonna end up sitting there just because he said that.....and......guess what? HahaAnywho, so we ordered one large for the two of us. I'm not sure why we ordered the large. I guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We did a split topping of margherita and I think the Italian sausage. It was piping hot when it came out and we were ready to dig in! My margherita was good but I think it's lacking a bit on the basil. I was expecting full on leaves but instead we got about 10 very thin julienne pieces. Booo!!! I love me my basil! The sausage one was definitely a guys' delight. Very meaty. Overall, I like how thin the crust was and the flavors were good but I don't think it's the best pizza in all of NY. I would go back again to try the rest of their selections but perhaps during Spring so I don't freeze my sunny Cali girl ass to death! OOOO and hopefully this time, we get seated in a space where personal space is not a luxury. Thank you very much! :P",2/2/2011,11,44,0,wnSAmjtTVMx5-8RL0-thOA

4005,Chris S.,0,3,I've been to this place often. Sometimes it's good - Sometimes it's not.

4006,Toby W.,0,5,"How does anyone give Lombardi's less than five stars? Look: sometimes quality trumps cost, and downgrading an institution like Lombardi's because it's ""too touristy"" doesn't make you look sophisticated.(Deep breath)Onto the food: I grew up in New York, and as such, have had many a slice of New York style pizza in just about every borough (save Staten Island, rarely a reason to go out there). And they're all fairly consistent and tasty. But they are homogeneous to a point - not a ton of variation from place to place, at least where your ""hole in the wall"" is concerned (see what I did there?)But when you go to Lombardi's, you understand why it's that much better. Unlike your standard New York slice, we're talking even better texture with the crust, extra care in the oven, and quality ingredients from the cheese to the pepperoni - which is crazy good here by the way. It's almost like a different food completely when compared to a standard slice, and in a good way.Because it's pricier, always has a wait for a table and is not as convenient as other places that will reheat a slice for you on the go, it may not always be the best option for New York residents.

Fast food always tastes better when trashed and even in my incoherent state I thought the pizza was AWFUL! Perhaps my body agreed as I proceeded to puke it out later on the way home. Maybe in its hey day this pizza earned their long waits and large crowds but with plenty of fabulous pizza in NYC, I don't feel the need to give it another chance. Lombardi's gets one star for the accommodating wait staff that cooked our pies close to closing time. It gets the other star for being a part of NYC history.",2/11/2010,319,270,1367,bmiAy-CdzxWPi3Yr_fljHw
4009,Meredith A.,0,4,"Came here for NYC pizza upon recommendation from a friend.  Apparently this place is legen-wait for it -dary, so we came on a Sunday night to see what the fuss was about.  We didn't wait too long, only about 10 minutes.  It's way bigger than it looks with lots of hidden rooms.  Pizza here was fairly expensive, and a small definitely feeds 2 people.  We got meatballs and spinach on it which probably made the pizza close to $26, which is totally bananas.  Still - the crust was crisp, the cheese was super melty, the meatballs were okay, but the spinach was oddly fantastic.  Weird to rave about the spinach of all things, but I swear it was the best part of the pizza.  It was garlicky and outstanding and you should get it.  Anyway, it was pretty darn good - I liked it better than my fiancé but this is my review so he can deal with it - but we didn't get our socks knocked off, especially for the price.  We get pizza that's just as good if not a little better than this at home in Newcastle, England!  I think it's very good pizza but I bet, somewhere in New York, there's pizza that we would've thought was amazing.  We'll have to look for it next time we're in town!",11/11/2014,277,1190,3,yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ
4010,Max L.,0,4,"4 stars, I liked it.  The pizza and prices were good.  Service was straight, no push no upsell.  Quick seating for our party of 8.We ordered 3 pies, they came out quick and staggered. One clam, one cheese, and one meatball spinach.   Unfortunately the clam pie only comes in a small 6 slice version, or else we would have had 3, 8 slice pies which = 3 slices per person, which is pretty perfect. Anyways, we made it work.  The clam pie was grand, plenty of clam and a nice pan crust, the crust on all of the pies was great crispy throughout, with a mellow yeasty flavor, the sauce was bright and tangy, and the cheese was fresh, but chewy.  Also, the sauce and cheese run all the way to the edge, which gives this pizza the edge.There are 4 red wines at 7 bucks and 5 or so beers at 6 bucks.  We had a few of each + the pizza and we got out of there for $92.15 for our party of 8 with gratuity included.Zagat says that it's ""the best pizza on the planet,"" it's not.  I prefer South Brooklyn Pizza at 1st Ave and St. Marks, for example.  But it's huge, fast, professional and tasty, great for groups, and memorable.",12/20/2010,23,54,0,IPpjUnFDOMZovBoN2FOnVQ

4017,Katie C.,0,4,"You don't know what good pizza is until you try this place. Lombardi's is listed in NYC guide books for a reason - they know how to make New York pizza. You comet to NYC for three main things: 1. tourist attractions 2. shopping 3. food. Pizza is at the top of the list of what New York is known for. It's not just deep dish or regular crust, in New York you get huge slices that tastes like nothing you have ever tried before. Lombardi's knows what they are doing and you would not complete your tour of NYC without stopping here. Me and my friend are new natives of NYC. So we were deprived of good pizza all of our lives. Here at Lombardi's you need to try the pizza as plain as possible to appreciate the goodness. The perfectly baked crust, the fresh mozzarella, the savory tomato sauce. Yes. you need to experience every ingredient and the only way to do that is to get the Margarita pizza. They also have a special ""clam"" pie that I heard was a must try. But me and friend ordered a small margarita and a house salad. It was enough food for two chicks, trust me. I also got a raspberry iced tea - no refills. The place was pretty big. Restaurant style, no such thing as grab and go here. Full bar with many tables to accompany very large groups. Great location, right by the subway stop of the 6 train-Spring. The staff was okay. They weren't overly fantastic, more like pushy but not in a rude way. Cleared tables fast. Watch out, if you pick up your slice of pizza, your plate may no longer be there.The pizza was amazing. Trust me, if you go anywhere else for pizza, you will end up with a soggy crust that can't even hold up the toppings. The crust at Lombardi's is light, crunchy, crispy and so delicious. Holds the toppings well and isn't soggy at all. It was perfection. The tomato sauce was everything tomato sauce should be. The mozzarella was so fresh that you know it's made in-house. The pizza was so very good. It is no doubt that Lombardi's is known for their pie making skills. I fell in love. The salad was like a regular salad. Mixed greens with grape tomatoes, mushrooms, raw onions with a balsamic vinaigrette. It complemented the pizza well. Everything went together so great. The raspberry iced tea was good as well - not worth 2.50 without refills though, but it's all natural flavorings, not of that syrup stuff. So all in all the food was perfection. I would come back again and again and again and any time I crave pizza. it is the place to go.The small Margarita came with 6 slices - huge NY slices might I add. It was 15-16 dollars. The salad was 7-8 dollars and non alcoholic beverages are 2-3 without refills. It's pricey, but it's located in SoHo and the pizzas are really that great. They can price however they want. The portion was filling for just us two girls. Perfect servings. I love this place and it's my new found home for pizza. i recommend this place to everyone and to all tourist that plan to come, it's definitely a place you MUST TRY if you're only in town for a few days.",12/14/2010,161,409,338,SVwKjoWmi_9fZvTOZgiETA

Definitely worth the take out... it was an experience in itself.We asked what was recommended or highly bought and she suggested between the meatball pizza and the clam topping. We were like UHHH clam!?! no thanks. I usually like seafood but not on my pizza.We ended up taking it outside where the line was and purposely ate it in front of everyone. A guy driving by actually stopped his car and watched us devour the delicious pizza in the below freezing weather! Boy did this warm me up.

4036,Elaine C.,0,2,"Why I came?Visiting New York City means you have to get some pizza.  Well I decided we had to go to Lombardi's since it's supposedly the first pizza joint in the city and it's supposed to be amazing. Parking?I suggest taking the train or a taxi to this place.  Parking does not exist around here.  How's the service?The serve is super good.  Waiters and waitresses really know the menu and will give you good suggestions.How's the wait?The wait is horrible but good thing there's a bar to kill time.  How's the pizza? 1 Word.  Overrated.  Yes the pizza comes out piping out.  The cheese is bubbly, the crust is really thin with slight burns on it but the pizza gets soggy fast and it didn't have that little crunch I crave for when eating pizza.  If I just described your favorite type of pizza, then you MUST go here.  I've definitely had better, mind blowing pizza.  So 2 stars because really ""meh. i've experienced better.""",1/13/2011,115,64,157,_tjP-zCsCfq1Sp9-3BH7Xg

4045,Marie J.,0,1,"So my husband and I on our honeymoon decided to go to NYC as our trip! We were really excited and made a list of ""to-do's"". Lombardi's happened to be one of them.  On our last night of NYC we thought a pizza was a great night to top off our NYC experience. We took a cab and spent $20 to get there. We walked in and were sat almost right away. We walked through the kitchen area which I thought was kinda cool and were seated.  We attempted to order the clam pie but they had run out. So we went with the margherita and half meatballs. And drinks of RC and iced tea.  Now, my husband had mentioned as we were sitting and waiting for pizza that for the ""first pizzeria"" in the country, they decor seems to be very generic every where else pizza joint. Same red and white table cloths, same pictures on the walls.  We even noticed that they don't serve pizza at the bar? What? Why not? It would be good for solos who want just a slice or two since I also noticed that they only sell them by the pie. Our food came and it was good.  It was okay. The crust was nice, crispy and sturdy, but overall bland. Maybe I put too much of the hype that I heard about this place and just ended up saying ""meh"" to the pizza. So we asked for our check. Fifteen minutes it took to ask for our check and get change. FIFTEEN minutes! Are you kidding me?!?!?!? So my husband and I sat there watching the clock for 15 minutes while we were thirsty as refills were not available nor were we served water to wait. So when the change finally showed up, I didn't want it to be unsaid so I told the waitress what's the deal is with 15 minutes to ask for check and get change. It's not like there were lines out the door. She basically gave an unapologetic ""sorry"" while looking around trying to get out of the conversation.  WTF???? What kind of service is that? Really? You are the face of your establishment and you should look someone in the eye and be sincere about what happened. Look, I generally don't complain much about this industry. Being a waitress is hard. I'm a GM at an Irish Pub in California, but if I found out one of my staff treated a customer with that much disregard, I would have a very long unfortunate conversation with said employee. I was always taught that the staff are the front face of the company - No matter how horrible your day or life is, you put a smile on your face and if you make a mistake, own it be sincere and make up for it any way you can or you'll end up with an unfortunate yelp and a unhappy customer for life who will probably tell everyone else they know never to go there because of their own experience. So pizza okay - service not so much.",7/26/2015,0,1,0,db3r5DeIg4Zt2SKJxJoSgQ

4047,Judy J.,0,4,"Went here with out-of-town friends who wanted some good pizza.  I'd been told that this place or Grimaldi's was the perfect place to go for a historic DELICIOUS slice of pie.We arrived in the middle of the afternoon - not what I'd call lunch OR dinner time - and were told there would be a 45min wait.  Fine. it's expected here, we knew that'd happen.When we were finally seated, we were told that they turned the oven off for an hour, so we wouldn't be able to order any pizza until 3pm.  Gee, since we clearly came here for the SALAD, that's okay (that was sarcasm, in case you didn't pick up on it...).  We ended up ordering a salad, and put in our order for a pizza with meatballs, pepperoni and mushrooms, to be cooked as soon as the oven was back on.  We were going to order something else for an appetizer, but (thankfully) our server was pretty honest with us and said they wouldn't recommend the breadsticks.Based on our experience, I'd give this place 3 stars, if it weren't for the Meatball Manna from HEAVEN.  The meatballs earn this place an extra star.  The pizza in general was really really good, but the wait time and the fact that they turn their oven off for an hour in the middle of the day (and don't advertise or even MENTION this)... well, it was less-than-ideal.",6/1/2013,334,99,97,A2S_oRDVj3JygGjcslQn0A

When the pie first arrives it is a pretty delicious few bites. Within 3 minutes it becomes dry and quite frankly, terrible. It is an authentic and simple pie but I guess I prefer a slightly oily and cheesier pizza. They have many rooms here in the expanded restaurant. We did not get our drinks or water until after the meal came and they were full but not slammed. Shouldn't this stuff be figured out with such a legendary joint? I guess they don't have to try that hard as people are coming in droves, and admittedly the prices are pretty fair.  Zagat calls it the best  pizza on the planet.

We got there at 10:55pm and were told that we could only order food to go. So we ordered our pie and got ready to leave, then we noticed that there were still people there eating!I asked if we could stay there and eat quickly and the gal at the front door said no! Boo- bad callAnyways we took our pie and left - bad customer service on their end!!I'll take one star off for the bad customer service",12/14/2010,65,31,1,InAitwGvsETNOnEoCJsEKg
4087,damian a.,0,4,"So we ate at the famed Lombardi's Pizza of New York.  I come from Detroit and its thick crust, thick sauce style of pizza, but I've always preferred thin and crispy, and Lombardi's did not disappoint.  We had the traditional margherite, and i have to say it was perfect if you like this kind of pizza.  The pizza was huge, not too expensive considering how much they could probably get away with charging.  They had good wine options, and for as busy as they were (the week of NYE), service was still friendly and attentive.  Was it the best pizza ever?  i don't really know.  It's not that hard to make a great thin crust pizza because the best pizza is simple sauce and simple ingredients.  The key is that the ingredients are fresh and high quality, and Lombardi's did that right.  Pizza in Italy is even more sparse, and it seems more often than not devoid of sauce entirely, so it's hard to compare across styles.I'm hesitant to give 5 stars though because, again, it's not that hard to make a really good thin crust pizza, and I've only eaten here once, but it's definitely worth trying if you can find a time when they're not busy.  I'd say it's even worth a 45 minute wait to at least try it.",1/7/2010,107,74,0,kg6vrJmppI8LScfsySI6dw
4088,Sharan K.,0,4,"4 days in New York and we had to get some authentic NY pizza. My friend Fiona had suggested Lombardi's after reading that it was the people's choice best pizza in New York. So one fine evening we decided to venture out to Soho to try this so-called best pizza of NY. We started off with the bruschetta. I love bruschetta. This however, was not what I was used to. Not to say it wasn't good, but it wasn't great. The bread was not as toasted as it could have been and was getting a little soggy from the tomatoes. The tomatoes though, were delicious they tasted very fresh. For pizza, we ordered the original - san marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese and romano and fresh basil. Thin crust pizza is my favorite, so this pizza was near perfect. I like when pizza is a little more on the saucy side, which they accomplished well. Not too much cheese - check. And crust that I don't mind eating at the end, yum. Three slices later and my craving was fully satisfied.Lastly, we got a pitcher of diet coke - standard with pizza. I was a little disappointed with this diet coke. I know, how can you ruin diet coke. Well you can. The lack of carbonation was not acceptable. In any case, we drank it because you can't eat pizza without a glass of soda right?I give Lombardi's 4 stars. I'm not sure if I would go back, I've definitely had some 5 star hole-in-the-wall pizza in NY at 4am that could definitely compete.",1/23/2011,339,19,5,jg7xae6QreSK8xPesXES8Q

Being in the heart of Little Italy there definitely is better pizza to be had and I will be steering clear of this spot from now on. To make matters worse these people don't accept credit cards and write bills that no one who isn't a waitress can understand. They want $3 for each topping but they can't even take credit cards or make decent food? I might as well have gone to the Olive Garden. Hospitality is not Lombardi's stronge suit.

4099,D J.,0,5,My wife and I went to NYC with our two boys (9 & 7) and thought we would try some authentic old world Pizza.  Read the reviews for Lombardi's and thought we would give it a try.  We went about 7 pm on a Sunday and were worried about it being packed.  Was pleasant to find out that there would only be a 15 minute wait.  Bar area was nice to stand in and order a drink and there was a small bench next to it our boys could hang at while we waited.  Very comfortable place and very nice people.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was amazing!  Came up to the table quick to acknowledge us and got our drinks back very fast.  Ordered a couple appetizers (Breadsticks and sausage)  They were out on our table in less than 5 minutes.  It was crazy fast!  Food was great as well.  Thought the sausage and breadsticks were awesome.  We ordered a large pizza with half cheese and other half meatballs and pepperoni.  Pizza was out in under 15 and everything tasted great from the sauce to the meat.  Its a different style pizza with fresh cheese laid over top and its not the custom American way with a ton of cheese everywhere.  Tasted really good and highly recommended.  Service was top notch which is a always a worry for NYC.  A great example is my son dropped his spoon under his chair and just as I was looking down one of the wait staff brought over a fresh spoon.  Spoon made no noise but he saw it and responded lightning fast.  Great overall experience and highly recommend!!,6/30/2015,0,6,0,miWHHcdLkqJaGUg3Cw1Peg

4102,Jesus J.,0,5,"It was my first visit to NYC and I was recommended this place.  My friend said it was the best pizza he's ever had.  I have to say, I may have to agree.You can order up to 3-4 different sizes of pizza, with many different toppings available.  I ate the smallest sized pizza on the menu with meatballs, pepperoni, and olives.  It was absolutely delicious.  The pizza isn't greasy (I asked for extra napkins and the waitress proclaimed ""Oh, you won't need to damp the pizzas here"" - she was right), and is completely flavorful.  The cheese had a nice consistency and wasn't clumped about on the pizza.  You know where you take a bite and a huge clump of cheese comes with the bite and then you're left with a cheese-less pizza?  Yeah, it wasn't like that.  The sauce was delicious and didn't give me heart burn (which most pizza sauces do).  There was also a good balance of sauce.  Overall, the pizza hit the spot.The decor of this place is nice - has a typical pizza place vibe.  The service was great and attentive.  The people here work hard - you constantly see them running around cleaning off tables, cleaning floors, etc.  The waiters were running around making sure every table was satisfied.The only thing I didn't like about Lombardi's was that free refills on soda aren't complimentary.  I've been recently told that's a common thing in NYC, but I'm from D.C., and that is completely uncommon there.  On the bright side, though, I'm drinking less soda and that's good for everybody.During my next visit to NYC, I plan on returning to Lombardi's, and I can't wait.",9/6/2010,62,138,0,hWQMSVovOIIGm6JndJ0dKA

Tasty pizza, just not mind-blowing and a bit to be desired, i guess.

Although I liked the combination of the mozzarella, margherita sauce, crispiness of the crust, and basil, it just doesn't compare to the ooey, gooey melted cheese and globs of sauce on a deep dish.

Next time its you and me, salad. The pizza was good. Really good. But 'Best on the Planet?' I can't with good conscience confirm that suggestion as fact. the toppings were sparse. The mozzarella, however, was fresh and melty and delish. The thin crust was foldable and pretty close to perfect. But I wanted to be wowed!

It took us a while to find the place, but we finally did and got seated right away. The restaurant has a lot of history to it, and has tons of pictures hanging on the wall. We ordered the Original Margherita Pizza (tomato, basil, mozzarella, and we added pepperoni to it), and it was pretty good! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza i've ever had...but i think it's definitely good!! Being from the Bay Area, I think San Francisco has some pretty great pizzas that taste just as good or even better!

4140,Jessica S.,0,4,"NY trips always require pizza. I don't know WHY the pizza is so damn good here, but I'm not gonna question, I am just going to consume. While this place is a TOTAL tourist trap, I was happy to take the boyfriend here on what could be considered one of ""the"" pizza destinations in NYC. The wait here is absurd - but we put our names in, and went for a walk around SoHo while we waited (and I quietly considered eating both my arm and my boyfriend's arm off). We FINALLY got seated, and settled in for some pie. I let him decide both the size (large) and one of the toppings (meatballs), and also took his incredulous look when I suggested we get SOME kind of vegetable on it as well (which then became mushrooms). We both ordered a beer, and the waitstaff was very quick about coming around. The place is charming, and it seems like they pretty much know what they are doing here. The plus side of Lombardi's? While the wait for a table is something close to forever, the wait for pizza is like, a millionth of that. This is due to the fact that their oven is set at about 900 degrees, and so pizzas cook in there in about 4 minutes. Best cooking time I have EVER heard of. Pizza also comes out ridiculously piping hot, and I have one thing to say:""mmmmmmmmmmmm""I didn't talk to the boyfriend for most of the meal, and he responded in kind. We DESTROYED a large, and happily sat there sipping our beer, and got the very nice couple across from us to take our picture. Another one of those CASH ONLY places. I am always prepared in NYC for this type of shenanigan. My cousin says it's because of the crisis - I think it's just some kind of weird exclusive thing that is ""only in New York"".

It is a pizza with olive oil, herbs, and clams packed on top-no sauce. I've never had a clam pizza before and was skeptical before I tried it because it didn't appear that appetizing.

4187,Ann L.,0,4,"One day after class, some friends and I decided to go play pool down by SoHo, but since we hadn't eaten lunch, we decided to check out ""that famous pizza place that's nearby."" Apparently it's the first pizzeria in NY, and from the looks of it, things probably haven't changed *that* much since it first opened - the tables are on the small side and cramped together, and the restaurant still doesn't take credit cards. We ordered one large pepperoni for the four of us to share, and it was enough for all of us to be satisfied (although I think I could have gone for another slice, haha). I missed Di Fara's buffalo mozzarella, but apart from that the flavor was relatively similar (which is good). Warning - if you're stopping by, try to get there earlier than peak lunch/dinner hours. Luckily, our group arrived around 3pm when there weren't that many people, but it didn't take long for a huge crowd to accumulate outside, and there's very little waiting space inside.

4194,Jane N.,0,3,"I've been meaning to try Lombardi's ever since I saw a Travel Network special on best pizzas.  Plus I just like pizza.The place is always packed but we had to wait only 15 minutes for a table (probably because it was 20 degrees outside and most people opted to stay home).  We ordered a small pizza (6 slices) with extra sauce, mushrooms and pepperoni.  I was a little disappointed in the toppings selection (there were only about 8 or so) but perhaps I'm just spoiled by Posto.  I asked for the cheese to be very melted and that's how it arrived.  The pizza is of the thin crust variety and the crust had a nice chew and was crispy.  Surprisingly, the slices were not the typical NY slices, where you can fold them up.  They were on the small side and in fact, I saw lots of people eat them with a fork and knife.The mozzarella seemed more like pieces were sprinkled here and there, rather than throughout the entire pizza.  The extra sauce made the crust a little soggy but the flavor was nice and tomato-y.  The pepperoni was small as well and there wasn't as much mushrooms as I would have liked.Overall the pizza was good but I wouldn't call it the best pizza I ever ate.  In fact, I think the slices at the corner pizza store are more to my liking and reminiscent of NY.",1/11/2010,8,16,0,3NVJlKlztaZWMzBU0lH6MA

I called and spoke to Jessica who was nice, but told me their menu hadn't been updated since they stopped using bottles only cans. No problem, and I know this is NYC but I'm not going to pay $2 for a can of soda.

New York City takes it's pizza very seriously; it's practically a religion. So, my boyfriend and I went in with an open mind; ""Try all, choose best."" And, for only the second time in all our years of travel did we forego sampling a bunch of different places (despite our best intentions) in favor of returning to Lombardi's over and over. The crust is the perfect balance of cruchy and chewy. The ingredients are fresh, bright and incredibly simple (often harder to master than most complex recipies).

4201,Vivian K.,0,4,"Lombardi says they are the first american pizzeria. The restaurant was authentic (in my terms since I've never been to a pizzeria in Italy). It had a lot of small tables with checkered tablecloths. Lucky me I sat behind a flaming heater...........Pizza was served on an elevated plate to save the tight but cozy space. For late lunch, we ordered a small pie which was around $15 for six slices (two starving people; we were able to finish it of course). We also added one topping for $3 which was their handmade meatballs. Their were a lot of toppings available from different kinds of cheese and sausages and italian bacon(?); they were priced one topping for $3, two toppings for $5. So that the more toppings you choose, the greater the deal (but not really, they're tricking you haha)In about ten minutes the pizza came. (Yay! so fast!) The pizza was delicious. The cheese was not shredded mozzarella but more like sliced from the ""block"", so I think it keeps the flavor and makes it cheesier. Crust was thin, which I like. Lots of tomato sauce which I also love. The handmade meatballs were also delicious but I complain that they gave us too little :PThe bill ended up $20, so about $11 from each person. We calculated each slice was roughly $3, so it isn't overly expensive for pizza in new york. especially a good pizza.",2/27/2010,67,77,47,ahWSb1NevXCsnvg0r_KLOg

4212,Chris C.,0,3,"Update:  Had to tack on an extra star, since I had a slice of margherita pizza during Scott's Pizza tour and this slice was much better than my first visit!  Still not the best pizza in the world but the second time around was better than the first.  Also, the watery slices from the first visit were actually caused by the spinach we added so avoid this topping at all cost!Pros:  Historic and pizzas are relatively healthy/fresh tastingCons:  Too many to list, but lets itemize to make it easier to read...Hostess/Seating:  The ""no reservations"" and ""will only seat full parties"" policies work well for the restaurant, but SUCK for hungry customers.  The way they ""structure"" their seating is by groups less than three, greater than or equal to 5, and inbetween.  If you are in the wrong category (as I was for a party of 4) you will feel betrayed by customers who came in 3 minutes ago who are being seated before you even after a 30 minute wait (on a TUESDAY night!).  Bring some snacks to keep you from re-enacting the movie ""Alive"" with your dinner party while you wait.Wait Staff:  I've never seen such a crowded restaurant with such a skeleton crew.  There were tons of black shirts filling water glasses, but only one white shirt that night, who didnt even emerge until we had been sitting for 10 minutes.  At that point i was already chewing through my arms.  When we were finally graced by the dull waitress' presence, she messed up the order as she repeated it back to us.  Luckily my co-worker caught and corrected her.  Note that we only ordered 1 large pizza for the 4 of us to share so it wasnt rocket science.Food:  Cancel the drumroll.  If I liked my toppings to fall off the slice on its way to my plate, I'd come back.  if I liked my slices so soggy, that I cant even fold it in half the proper NY way (had to fold the pointed end towards the crust, THEN fold in half...imagine if you will the process of making a paper airplane) then I'd come back.  But, I can't say I'm a fan of water logged pizza folded like origami and more toppings on the table than in my stomach so I WONT be coming back.  Ever!Why the 2 stars:  It was cheap, so at least I didnt feel ripped off.  Also, my gf showed up after we already started so she was perched on the window ledge in the back room, and a waiter with extreme concern on his face came by to say ""OMG honey do you want me to get you a chair?  I'll be right back"".  If it wasnt for him, I was going to lean towards 1 star.  Shame on the straight waiters, and all waitresses of NYC!  I exaggerate but you have to admit it is rare to find restaurant staff who actually cares like this particular guy.",9/2/2009,11,8,62,z5mvh1TIs3rt2CF-tRldFg

That was really special. I'll call you.""But you don't call the hot girl, and you're not sure why. A week goes by, and she's texted once or twice. But when you really think about hot girl, seriously analyze hot girl, her eyes are a little too far apart. How did you not see that before? Maybe you were too busy looking at her chest. And while she was a perfectly adequate lay, she wasn't exactly amazing. No, she just kind of laid there, looking hot, knowing how hot she you think she is and how much you want to do her. Actually, the more you think about hot girl the more turned off you feel. ""I bet,"" you think, ""if she wasn't so hot she would have been better in bed. Or maybe,"" and this is really throwing you for a loop, ""I just projected this. Maybe, because I wanted her so long I built her up into a goddess, when she's just another hot girl with wide-set eyes and a boring sex drive.""You let another phone call from the hot girl go to voicemail and sadly shake your head.

4220,Ridley P.,0,4,"In a city full of big name pizzerias, Lombardi's, alongside Joe's and Grimaldi's, arguably has the greatest reputation.  While I'm an avid supporter of trying less established eateries who do not unapologetically market themselves to tourists (The ""I've eaten at Lombardi's"" T-shirts are beyond tacky), I had been led astray too many times with regards to ""New York style"" pizza.  I figured I'd go to one of the giants to finally resolve my apparently offensive inner Chicago-style pizza demons.  Despite the annoying marketing ploys, Lombardi's made a strong positive impression on me.  The pizza dough cooked in their coal oven has nice consistency although the dough flavor itself is somewhat unremarkable.  The tomato sauce is special; I'm not sure exactly what tomatoes are used, but the tomatoes themselves make the sauce (as opposed to added spices).  We topped our pizza with pepperoni and pancetta.  Both toppings were spectacular.  An appropriate amount of fresh basil was added to the pizza.  It was a bit difficult to eat this pizza as the hot oil and cheese oozed from the pie with each delicious bite (unfortunately, it was mostly oil).  I thought the price was about right.  I would have liked more cheese on my pizza, but in fairness to Lombardi's, the option is on the menu.Do I think this pizza holds a candle to my personal standard-bearer (Chicago giant Giordano's)?  No.  But it was the best NYC-style pizza I have sampled to this date.  I look forward to trying other options so that I can eventually drill down and find the best one in the city (I liked this one, but it's still not perfection).",8/3/2009,1380,1493,278,K7thO1n-vZ9PFYiC7nTR2w

On the way to our table, the host took us through the kitchen to see where all the magic happens. It's nice that they do this when seating you. Also, a firetruck of firemen pulled up while we were waiting, and went straight to the back for their pizza. Pretty cool that all these guys wanted Lombardis will all the options around the city. They also let some tourists look in the truck, which was super cool of them.We sat down and got the Large for two people. It's thin crusted and I easily finished 3 slices (bf had the other 5, oyy).

4231,Sarah G.,0,5,"I had some friends in town and they basically wanted to do an eating tour of New York. One of the top priorities was to consume pizza cooked in a coal oven. We were completely intending to go to that ""other"" place in Brooklyn...however fate stepped in.I had taken them to a lovely breakfast at Rice to Riches (what? you don't like rice pudding for breakfast?) and we stepped outside and admired the awning at the Pizza Place across the street. It proudly stated:""Americas First Pizzeria""We laughed it off....figuring it was lumped into the same category as ""Worlds Best Coffee"" (I mean how often do you see that sign). Then we wised up and realized it was Lombardi's Pizza...and maybe we did not have to go to Brooklyn after all!It was about 11:30 so there was no wait at all. We got in after about 5 minutes which was AWESOME. We quickly ordered up a large pepperoni pizza and tried to control our drool as we anxiously waited for our grub.This New York landmark definitely lived up to its reputation. The crust was amazing. It was thin, crunchy and oh so delicous. Best part of all? The pepperoni are the ones that look like suction cups! You know what I am talking about...the ones that collect the grease? YUM. The pizza was amazing. We demolished it in about 2.5 seconds. My only complaint....no refills on the soda. I mean...come on thats annoying and a huge pet peeve. But the pizza was so fabulous it overpowered the drink thing.",2/3/2008,412,326,89,aPcB5aPjxCh3N-CJ2YUHVg

So while visiting New York recently, I made it a point to stop in and try my first ever, real New York Pizza. I was blown away. I can't even begin to describe the flavors -- there was something about the crust itself that was different. There was a dash of something that made me think of the ocean, and a hint of smoky-flavor from the oven that reminded me of the woods. It was warm and delicious - and if pizza everywhere tasted like this, I might be able to get on board with it. I will absolutely make it a point to come back in the future, and I have already suggested it to many of my friends. I can't wait for more!",6/9/2010,108,218,19,IqLOhCR5E7fF8Oq6Ke1DPg

4242,Deanna W.,0,4,"After sampling Di Fara's, Arturo's and Patsy's over the years I finally made a stop at Lombardi's today after years of passing by and being intimidated by the crowds.This being a late weekday afternoon, there was only a couple ahead of us in line and we got the go ahead after waiting 5 minutes. Decor bleeds of italian-american kitsch what with the checkered table cloths and frank sinatra music playing but hey it's homey and there are lots of tables here evenly spaced out. Service was quick and friendly-we got the large pizza with the pepperoni. Now for the pizza:Pros: cheese better than arturo's, better crust (lighter) than arutro's, basil is free of charge and price is better than arturo's as well. Tomato sauce is very plain not much in way of herbs or spices but a vibrant tomato flavor which I like. I would say the crust or sauce is about on par with Patsy's with the crust being a little more airy at Patsy's-on a good day only. All in all a very solid pizza edging Arturo's out by maybe a nose. I like Arturo's better still in that it is not as much of a tourist mad house and the coal char is better on the bottom :)Cons: Basil is not as plentiful but then again it is free. Cheese, sauce and overall flavor not as good as the Di Fara's but hey at least it's heck of lot closer than Di Fara's.

NO surprises. NO frills. It is a solid pizza, but not THE best pizza in the ny metro area, in my opinion.pizza #1: italian meatball & mushroom pizza. Their meatballs are homemade and therefore delicious. It has just enough flavor to make you want to eat more slices than are available.pizza #2: clam pie. If you love clams, this pizza is for you. It's a clam & lemon explosion in your mouth. I wouldn't order it on my own, but when i'm with a clam aficionado, i'll go with it.pizza #3: the margherita. Obviously a classic that you can judge any ny pizza joint by.Do I love it? It's good, but not great. It's convenient and the place is so big that it's never too long of a wait.

4251,Mark P.,0,2,"I've eaten at all 3 of New York's Famous Coal Brick Oven Pizzeria's (Grimaldi's, Patsy's and Lombardi's), Lombardi's being the most recent, and out of all of them Lombardi's is the worst. I know I'm supposed to like Lombardi's, being that the other two opened up after, and were opened up by disciples of this Lombardi's location. Lombardi's status as the ""first pizzeria"" does not make it the best. The first thing I noticed was that the crust appeared to be under cooked, completely lacking the occasional charring that makes a coal fired crust distinct from other crusts. I also believe they used excessive yeast in the crust, thereby giving it a less developed flavor. The pizza was straight soggy and did not hold its form whatsoever, making it impossible to eat with one hand and folded in half, as is the tradition. No this pizza required a fork and knife, and both of my hands. The sauce was all wrong too. It wasn't dolloped on with a sauce ladle, in just the right proportion and in just the right areas. Instead it appears that the pizza maker messed up and put too much sauce and then covered up his error by spreading and smudging it all over the pizza dough. Unacceptable!  Being that their sauce is just blended canned tomatoes this gave my pizza an excessively bland flavor. I tried to make up for it by sprinkling extra grated cheese but to no avail. The service, although not terrible left much to be desired. They appeared understaffed.I left Lombardi's in complete dissapointment and no satisfaction.

It was tasty but the clams were a bit over cooked. Sigh. There was no sauce, i twas like the clams with fettuccine, without the noodles. If you like that, then you'll like the pie.

But yeah the back upstairs room definitely was really quaint and miles away from the hustle and cramped part of the rest of the restaurant.

My favorite from when I lived in NY.Having used the same recipe for pizza dough since the late 19th century (so says the history on their menu), Lombardi's truly does create a masterpiece of pizza proportions (that, consequently, helps to increase my proportions, but that's another story). The crust is perfectly crispy on the outside but fluffy and soft on the inside, and never burned. I usually go for the mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni - less is more with this pizza. The perfect sprinkles of basil are a great touch. (When I went last time, we got the sauteed garlic spinach in addition to the above ingredients, but as a I feared, it overwhelmed the simple, fresh flavors and I ended taking most of it off.)A must visit in NY!

4261,Tracy T.,0,4,"I'm REALLY torn as to how to rate this pizza. In short, the four of us split two pizzas of which two of the slices I had were 3 stars at best, but the slice I had from the cheese pizza was perhaps the BEST SLICE I HAVE EVER HAD.And now let's start the story. We walk in and after a short wait were seated at our table. It took forever to get the waitress attention to even get us drinks, and once we ordered our cokes, I found mine to be INCREDIBLY flat. So of course I sent it back and got a beer instead (you can't go wrong with beer). Sigh, a bad start.We ordered a large half meatball and half pepperoni and a small cheese pizza. The large came out first and we dove right in. I had the meatball, and I kind of wanted to just stop eating. The meatball wasn't very good and the slice was very sloppy and just not very appealing. However, I was hungry so I kept eating. The second slice I had ended up being half meatball and half pepperoni. Granted the pepperoni was a much better topping option than the meatball, but the pizza itself was rather awful.Now comes the good part. As I finished my second slice, the small cheese pizza arrives. I quickly took a slice for myself disregarding the others at my table and the first bite was HEAVENLY. I can even say that by this point, I'm not starving so it wasn't AMAZING only because I was hungry. It actually WAS AMAAAAAZING. The entire crust was very thin, light, and crispy. Perfect amount of cheese and tomato sauce. It was OMG good.Of course since it was so good, I had to eat another slice. Yes, my 4th slice. But I was incredibly disappointed. The 2 minutes it took me to devour that 3rd slice was just enough time for the 4th slice to get soggy and ""bleh"" as the first pizza had been. It was no longer crispy and light and heavenly. HOW SAD! Hence my dilemma in rating this pizza. It seems like what you get is completely dependent on how long it takes your server to get the pizza to your table after it leaves the oven. And of course how fast you eat the slice. How could I have a 5 star slice and a 3 star slice from the same pizza in a matter of minutes? Well, I did.",8/18/2009,71,129,2,ih5_IIVZwFOg2QG4FHiSAg

The interior is cute and clean, and the prices aren't too bad - around 20 ish for a small pie with half italian sausage and half handmade meatballs, cheese, and mushrooms over (plus 2 drinks). A very good thin crust, not too doughy with a good crust (not breadlike, but not crunchy like crackers either - a good medium). The sauce was tasty, but not overpowering and there wasn't TOO much cheese (I like). Definitely less greasy than Artichokes, but overall, a very different style of pizza. It struck me as being a very ""gourmet"" pizza, if there is such a thing. I myself prefer something a little less frou-frou, especially for a pizza joint.

I still hadn't tried Lombardi's, so we headed downtown for dinner. We waited less than 15 minutes to be seated in an overcrowded, yet charming and rustically decorated room.  I'm more of a slice girl, I guess, because I don't like ordering a whole pizza; however, there's not really any other option here. We decided on a large original pizza with half sweet Italian sausage, half pepperoni. After being knocked into by various people, due to lack of space, no less than a million times (nope. not an exaggeration.), our somewhat over-attentive server returned with our pizza. The toppings weren't evenly spread, nor were the slices cut equally, but that didn't really stop us from stuffing our faces. Their pizzas definitely have that fresh, high quality taste to them. However, something was missing. All the right parts were there, but the pizza just didn't have a wow factor to it. I wanted this to be the best pizza I had ever eaten, but it wasn't really all that memorable in the end.

4281,Carlos N.,0,5,"I start with a warning: If you come to Lombardi's, you will NEVER settle for regular pizza again.I stepped in on a rainy day, feeling curious as to whether this really beats out Grimaldi's or not (not too much of a difference). The place is well-illuminated and the service is on-point. The waiters are all very nice and talkative, and the area where the pizza is made is open, so anyone can see and take pictures of it.The one thing I hate about these old-world pizza parlors is that they don't serve by the slice, or serve pies which can *easily* be consumed by one person. Thus, I chose to get their $15 pie, which is actually about the size of a regular pizza pie. (I guess it's a good thing that I haven't eaten pizza for about a month prior to then, right?)The pizza is as good as it gets. The sauce is a little sweeter than Grimaldi's, but still has that great, natural taste. The bread is nice and soft, and the mozzarella is phenomenal. If you're a beer drinker, this probably goes down very well with Peroni; I just had water. (A sin, yes I know!) I ate the whole thing with absolutely no problems and no regrets.In short, it would be a sin to not eat at Lombardi's, Grimaldi's or Patsy's at least once.

The place was relatively empty with no wait-- probably due to it being a Sunday night.We all sat down and were STARVING, so we knew we were going to order food as soon as possible. Once we sat down, someone brought each of us water immediately, but then our server was no where to be found. In his absence, we all decided on our food choices (2 large pizzas - one classic, one spinach, mushrooms & feta)... and when the waiter finally came, the only words he said were ""Are you ready to order?""  No introduction, no small talk, nothing.  But we were so hungry, we ordered ASAP.  The breadsticks were INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING. Hard as a rock, no flavor and we went through the tomato dipping sauce immediately as to try to compensate for lack of flavor. Unfortunately there was no server around to ask for more. Thankfully, the pizza came quickly, but unfortunately, I could not taste it.  The ""brick oven"" flavoring was so thick on the bottom of the pizza that all I could taste was oven soot. I could only manage down half a slice before being overwhelmed by the flavor and felt sick.I am reading these other reviews and cannot figure out how someone might think this pizza was good, but I guess to each his own.  But I'd never go back here again.P.S.

We pretty much kept it simple, sharing a large mushroom and sausage between 4 of us (2 slices each).Excellent service with a personal touch that still makes this a favorite for folks in the neighborhood and beyond. No surprise the place gets really crowded. And since they don't take reservations, I wouldn't recommend going during rush hours.

4307,Queenie M.,0,5,My first time in New York and I was falling deeply in love with this city. Places like Lombardi just make me love it that much more.I came with a friend and we just ordered the most basic plain original one. We were going to board our flight after this so all we did was eat a slice and took everything else to go. I bet the waiter thought we were weird but that's okay.Wait wasn't long for a table or the pizza. And everything was just so good the mozzarella and the nice thin crust. I prefer simplicity much over anything else so I do like the pizzas in New York as compared to California.,8/10/2010,15,89,127,7RTbb6LoWBUCSP4xnEtw5Q

4310,Payam Z.,1,4,"I'm always skeptical about pop/tourist joints as I find the experience redundant... under-tipped and unhappy wait staff mixed in with an extended wait both outside and inside the restaurant and in the end you have the most standard meal you had to finish in 10 minutes.Having said that, Lombardi hype was just too tempting and I needed to believe NY can make good pizza (what can I say? Standards are set high in Boston!) How was it? Going early is a must. We got there around 6:15 on a weekend and the wait was about ten minutes, but the line had at least tripled when we were leaving the place at 7ish. Aside from that everything was near perfect; going through the maze-like rooms and the kitchen to get to the small back dining room helped create a great ambiance of a cozy NYC pizzeria! Menu was short and focused on the prized pizza; smart way to ensure speedy orders and service. To top things off, our waiter was actually pleasant and did not rush us until after we were done eating! As for the infamous Pizza, we split the small into a section of margherita and another of garlic marinated spinach and meatballs. The cheese and toppings were top notch and the crust was thin.

But I didn't get much cheese, nor do I recall getting to the finish line.. desperate for that post-coital cigarette. Didn't happen.Is it delicious pizza? Yea, it's good pizza. Good crust, great sauce, gooey cheese, pieces of basil lovingly dispersed throughout. And I say lovingly because it looked as though there was love and effort put into my pizza. So I use that as an excuse as to why I had half a pie. Four stars because there wasn't really much of a wait, which was surprising.But I'm looking for the Big O in my pizza slice. I'm sorry Lombardi's, it's not me. It's you. You just haven't given me what I'm looking for.Don't look at me like that, with your puppy eyes and that delicious smell oozing from your pores.

4321,Mar C.,0,1,"I'm also a Chicagoan.... and I'd like to offer a differing  view of the pizza I ate at Lombardi's recently.  First of all, NY style pizza is generally characterized as having a puffy, bready outer-crust,  that flattens down to an extremely thin crispy middle with an underside crust that typically ranges from dark brown to burnt .  And I'm not kidding when I say burnt!   Chicago pies are covered with a liberal dose of  tomato sauce along with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese that is balanced with spicy Italian sausages cut into 1/2 in. pieces spread out evenly all over the pizza.  As far as the crust goes, the outer parameter is in proportion with the rest of the pizza and the underside ISN'T burnt!    What I didn't like about Lombardi's was the overall skimpiness of the main ingredients...the cheese, the (Esposito) sweet Italian sausages and the tomato sauce.  Only the bare minimum.  But the biggest SIN  was the BURNT crust.  Yuck!  Imagine something akin to burnt toast.  Pleasant thought, eh?  Another thing I found missing in Lombardi's pizza is what I call the  crunch factor.  I felt like I was eating a soggy cracker instead of a full-bodied crispy pizza.  Another thing, it was too mild, that is, to the point of being almost bland.  I guess I'm just use to a crunchier pizza that has an overabundance of ingredients. All I can say is, Lombardi's serves a pizza that's a lot different than pizza's served in Chicago.  Close, but definitely no cigar!",6/20/2006,18,168,62,XrAUz3BL6LdyzSgpC3Uh5g

A pizza and salad is a lot of food for 2;3. Always order extra cheese on your pizzas;4. Order 3 or less toppings (that doesn't include the extra cheese) because the crust just won't hold that many (my toppings' choices are the mushrooms, olives, pepperoni, meatballs, and sauteed spinach); and5.  You really shouldn't do delivery unless you are just desperate for pizza, because it just does not travel well",1/2/2007,29,120,40,DiDEJ_RzN_olHj8z-72CXA

I believe I had spinach and ricotta cheese which was absolutely amazing! The carnivores of the group loved the meatball, sausage, and pepperoni slices. With tip and tax it came out to be an okay amount for a delicious dinner. The wait wasn't too bad for our large group and everyone was so nice.

Real ingredients, none of that fake stuff. The crust could have been a little more cooked, but besides that, it was great.The service was alright. Because we were a big group, we were taken upstairs so what may have been the roof of the building at some point, but is now enclosed. We got a great view, which kind of made up for the lack of service we received at times.For those curious as to their ""America's First Pizzeria"" advertising, we asked our waiter.

The prices are a bit high.  I'd say it's on the same level as Zachary's in the Bay Area price wise. I got three toppings on our half and half small pizza. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Ordered the original and took it to the park down the street to eat there. Stumbled upon a photo shoot at the park, so we enjoyed our pizza while we watch the model pose for the camera. Pizza was thin. Used fresh mozzarella and basil. Can easily eat 3-4 slice in a sitting because the crust was so thin. Actually shared the whole $12 pie with a friend who's a girl. Sauce was sweet and I can tell its very fresh. I actually like this place better than Grimaldi's.

We started with a house salad, which was super basic - mixed greens, a few cherry tomatoes, sliced fresh mushrooms, and thinly sliced red onions, topped with a tangy blue cheese dressing. For something so simple, it was really good (or maybe we were just starving). We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms (fresh, not canned, a novel idea in NY), roasted red peppers and onions. Fantastic sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and great crust - just salty enough, and perfectly thin so that the edges are a little crispy but still soft on the inside. Definitely up there with some of the best pizza I've had in NY! They deliver to a limited area, but it's not the same. I know because my office has ordered it a couple of times.

But then i discovered Lombardi's, and John's has never been the same to me since. As it turns out, when it comes to sharing a pie, i like to go old school... and Lombardi's has so much history you can taste it. The pizza is thin and delicate and reminiscent of an older NY. A small pie is good for 2 people, but get a medium if you're hungry and not planning on having an appetizer. The rest of the menu is good too, but i admittedly have only ordered a thing a two to keep my table busy, and while good, nothing is particularly memorable.If you're hungry and not up for a wait, the best time to go to Lombardi's is on a weeknight, because the weekends always have lines.

The cheese was very rich but not too greasy. But the best part was the sauce. It was thin but it had a lot of body. It didn't taste too salty or dry or weak. It was just perfect.The pizza went down quick, and it didn't feel fattening at all. I liked Lombardi's Pizza, and I look forward to going back again the next time I'm in New York.

4348,Jonathan G.,0,4,"Coal burning ovens (only one of two in the city) make the difference. The pizza toppings are fresh and of superior quality. The crust was not as thin as I would have expected or liked, but still way above average.The long wait, packed seating, and less than friendly (or maybe just exhausted and rushed) wait staff would probably prevent me from making this a regular haunt except for delivery.",6/15/2010,119,657,1,mTcP_4sV434OoVWwUv_Z6A
4349,lora c.,0,4,"I enjoy this pizza better than Grimaldi's, but it's like comparing apples and oranges. Whereas Grimaldi's pizza is pure Brooklyn (thick, heavy with mozzarella, and maybe even a little soggy), Lombardi's is a thin-crusted motherfucker, crispy when it first comes out, but woefully limp once it cools. NYers feel no shame in going to Lombardi's for dinner, compared to the touristy line waiting that is necessary at Grimaldi's. Last time, we waited a quick 20 minutes at Lombardi's, but we were seated in the second room and it was a tad drafty. Try to sit in the first room (with the bar) if you are looking for the full experience, where the decor is nicer and the ambiance is a bit more festive. Also, cash only! The BF had to run out to the ATM at the end of dinner, but of course, I passed the time by finishing off our wine. We ordered a large pie and took home leftovers. A nice, casual, and very comforting meal.",4/30/2010,76,254,22,3QZXMJvtbzNU_ELLJbPu5A

4355,Richard C.,0,4,"So, I went after looking at all the guide books, reading reviews here on Yelp, and asking folks on the street.  Don't know how I never realized that they don't do pizza by-the-slice, so I ended up ordering an entire 14"" pizza for myself.  Met the owner, I believe, only after looking like the lost tourist that I was.  Said it would take 20 minutes, so I walked around the corner and returned to wait a few more minutes for my expected masterpiece.  I got my pizza fresh out of the brick oven (I love brick oven pizza alla napolitano-style (should have figured the family was from Napoli).I hurried out of there with my fresh, steaming-hot pie topped with half pepperoni (surprised how small the pepperoni was) and half ricotta/spinach.  My first bite at the playground around the corner on Mulberry St.  was one filled with skepticism.  Is this truly the ""Best Pizza in the World"" as Zagat's claims?  I don't think so.  It was better than any NYC pizza I had so far on my trip (ate at 3 different places) and the freshness of the ingredients was definitely evident.  It was just good, not great (of course, I compare every pizza I eat these days to my favorite places in Napoli).I devoured the pizza best I could, but had some leftovers that didn't taste as good the second time around.  Overall, I can say this is the best New York pizza this So Cal man has eaten.  I think my experience would have been different with other ingredients.",6/19/2008,107,122,0,_ohccCXtemB2dXszTONj1w
4356,Janel Y.,0,3,"Had to have some pizza while in the Big Apple so tonight's dinner was dedicated to Lombardi's. There was less than a 5 minute wait for our party of 3 tonight...and that was at prime dinner eating time. We were led through the innards of Lombardi's and I was surprised at actually how big it is.We decided on a large with homemade meatballs, sausage and mushrooms ($23) as well as an appetizer of bruschetta ($9). The bruschetta was okay, 4 big squares with fresh tomatoes on top. The pie overall was okay. The best topping out of the 3 we ordered was definitely the homemade meatballs which was soft and tender and didn't taste artificial like those Costco frozen ones. They use fresh mozzarella and there's a thin cover of sauce on the pie. The dough is super thin but I found it tasted rather salty. As the pie gets cold, it gets harder to cut and is pretty chewy.It's a popular place, don't get me wrong. Lots of old school pictures on the walls add a definite local feel. I'm glad I got my pizza in NYC...now on to having a hot dog.",4/12/2009,299,1407,1628,Wb5Gs_FpWDYjrhn0luPd3A

While sitting and enjoying my beer I was watching the front door, anxiously awaiting my friend's arrival. It wasn't very crowded and at that point there were no one in the waiting area. As I glanced at the door I see something moving out of the corner of my eye. I do a double take, sure enough a mouse, just hanging out in the waiting area. I suppressed my urge to jump up on my bar stool and scream like a little school girl and, instead, quietly call over the bartender and inform him of the situation. He thanks me for being so cool about everything and offers to buy my next round. My friend arrived and we were seated, though he assured me he would send the drink to my table it never arrived. While we were eating the only thing I could think about was the darn mouse and I couldn't wait to get out of there. I'm realistic and know things like this happen just about everywhere, but it was enough to cause me to stay away.

4358,Jay G.,0,5,"The best pizza yet to touch my lips.I heard about this place from many of my friends. I was surprised by the amount of recommendations to visit one place so I figured it was a sign.After shopping all day in Soho my feet were tired, I was extremely hungry, my head hurt, and my stomach was mad at me for skipping our lunch time and abusing it.It was around 2:30pm, I was with 2 of my closest friends in the world, and the aroma filled the air. Walking in we were greeted by a hostess and were seated quickly. It was actually dead quiet in there and I was worried that the place wouldn't live up to the hype since it wasn't busy. The decor was what I imagined it to be. Small round and square tables, white and red checkered table cloths, a small dark wooded bar, and pictures of what I assume to be the owner with family, friends, and celebrities.We ordered a peperoni, and a margherita pizza. It was amazing. The tomato sauce was fresh, the cheese was creamy, the crust was thin, and that charcoal oven gives it all an amazing taste. I imagine pizzas in Italy taste similar to this as everything was simple yet very fresh and tasty. It is my favorite pie in Manhattan and so far the world.Overall, you have to come here. The prices are just right and the taste is outstanding. Whenever I eat pizza anywhere, I always compare the pie to those found here.

But unlike Sal's, they don't act like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to enter. The service is very good and the pizza is elite-level.  Don't load it up with multiple toppings.  Stick to Margherita with one or two basic toppings (I recommend either pepperoni or calamata olives).  The simpler the pie, the better.The wait can be rough if you time it wrong.  Euro-tourists with strong currencies have made this a tough table to get at peak dining times, but they've expanded recently and the line moves fairly fast.  Oh, and bring back the simple oil/vinegar dressing on the basic starter salad.",12/13/2008,41,123,8,N52nbyDKZte4PUfJVNpkGQ

Thickness of crust, amount of cheese, sauce, authentic coal oven vs. regular oven -- they all make for varied formulas and results.All I have to say is, New Yorkers have it so good. Maybe it was because Lombardi's was the first slice of official NY pie I had back in '02, but it should be a crime for pizza joints to bake their pies in anything but a coal brick oven. This is where I go every time I get to go to NY. I actually loved it when Lombardi's was just a tiny rustic shoebox, before it expanded into a larger, glossier restaurant. I love that the crust is slightly charred, tastes sooo good that way. And the sauce is just about perfect, robust and good enough that you don't really need anything beyond the cheese.

There was lots of places to sit and wait and smell and watch. Now we love food especially pizza. So I have very high expectations. We sit down and ordered a large pie with fresh garlic on it (because it was free). It came maybe within 10 minutes which was great. The first bite was amazing, cheese, sauce, crust, very tasty. The crust is amazing by the way.  If you don't go for anything else go for the crust.  The only place where this pizza was lacking was the sauce. And that's a problem because there's alot of places where its only sauce and crust because the mozzarella isn't shredded its put on in slices.  The sauce is very plain. Just tomato basically.  And I guess thats probably ok for some people but I like a flavorful sauce.  The other problem here is that it's very touristy.  Its worth the trip and it is very good pizza, but not the best.p.s.  If you want the best pizza ever...got to Elegante's in Brooklyn.p.p.s.

4388,Kyle T.,0,4,"Okay, so this is tough. I mean how the hell does one give a 5 star- this is the BEST damn pizza you'll ever eat kind of thing? For sure, lets start by saying that I'll toss it into my top 10 pizzas in America for sure.So, since there is no 4.5 (split between 5 and 4) I have to cop-out and rate it this way:On pizza alone I'd probably give it a respectable 5-star but for the food across the board, I have to drop it slightly to a 4-star rating. The 5-star side of it: History and heritage. It's one of America's few opportunities for a true coal oven pizza that has a pedigree of over 100 years plus. It's got that charm and the panache that begs for authenticity. And in the end, it's a great thin crust pie with amazing toppings and a truly tasty and unique flavor. Crusty bottom, smooth velvety cheese and sauces that truly define it as one of the best. (I suggest the sausage, roasted peppers and pepperoni!) Ooooh, or a calzone...Mmmmm.The 4-star side: The salads and the breadsticks are pretty simple and underwhelming. And with such hype surrounding the other items you'd expect home runs across the board. But honestly, many fall simplistically flat. And yes, you do have to factor in that it is a tourist destination so at times it is a bit of a wait and can get a bit overwhelming. (Nothing a Peroni from the bar can't cover.)However, I will refer back to my original question and admit that picking THE BEST PIZZA EVER is virtually impossible. So, rather I will give respect to such an unfortunately commoditized and hugely subjective love of mine such as pizza, to a bigger group. Meaning, Lombardi's is great and deserves to be added to the list of top 10 pizzas I've ever had. More so, Lombari's is certainly worth experiencing to cast your vote. But I will say, that despite all the hype and expectation, and the surge of tourists and the sometimes looooong wait - that if you pop a cold beer and sip back as you enjoy a folded piece of whatever pie suits you...you should walk away happy-happy. I mean in a nutshell, if you love pizza then you certainly have to leave this planet being able to tell your friends that you've eaten here once.",10/19/2008,9,30,1,bN-QNxRGzx6VeWOgcCnekQ

We asked the waitress and she was kind enough to change it for us but it was the exact same thing again. The pizza had some sort of weird taste on 1 side (as if wine got poured on it) and smelled funny too.

If you like a chewier and softer crust this may not be right for you but if you're a thin crust fan this is perfect.There are a couple of rules when dealing with Lombardis though-don't go alone cause they don't sell by the slice,and try to go at a less busy time cause it is a huge tourist trap and there can be a wait.  The pizza has a nice old fashioned style to it,and the toppings are all so fresh and high quality.

4392,Mike T.,0,4,"Lombardi's wasn't anything that I expected! But it was great! I was hoping for the greasiest NY style pizza I had ever had. However, Lombardi's is more of a gourmet style pizza place that seems to pride itself upon extremely fresh ingredients and an incredible atmosphere. No grease. But delicious pie. Lombardi's itself was way bigger than I expected! We asked for a booth and had to walk through a few different rooms, and even the kitchen to finally get to our table. This place was packed! There must have been 100 tables, and almost all were occupied. We were seated in a window overlooking the New York street. Make sure you get a window table! It really makes for a great setting while you're dining. Now the pizza! Delicious thin crust, and the tomato sauce was so fresh! Drizzled mozzarella cheese covered the pie. It wasn't anything that I expected.. and after paying over $28 for the meal, I was a little worried. However, it was the most delicious pizza! Loads of flavor, and the pepperoni was super crisp! Make sure to get extra mozzarella cheese! Our waitress was a little slow, but it was a busy day.

Now it gives me a vibe that they are trying to be modern and corporate and it doesn't fit their image at all, IMO.I've never ordered anything but the pizza, so I don't know how the other stuff on the menu fares. It is a bit overpriced, but I don't care. I get the pizza plain or with onions because anything else would overpower that lovely, pure, fresh taste.",10/1/2010,2,14,4,FpTf2jDHuLQGZSdpIhlTkg

4404,Mark M.,0,5,"I don't really have a lot to add to the three hundred some-odd reviews that've already been posted. Lombardi's has a century of pizza-making expertise under their belt and the allegiance of countless devotees to vouch for their must-try delicacies!Any of their pizzas are good as-is. This is coming from someone who typically won't eat pizza unless it's missing the cheese, because I don't really like cheese. Not because of lactose-intolerance issues, but because I find it unappetizing.But the mozzarella has just the right amount of resistance to it, a simple, fresh milk taste that's out-of-this world. I can even stand the touch of sharp Pecorino Romano they add, well, because it gives a nice, salty kick to everything.Their perfectly thin crust is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, yet still pliable and chewy.The sauce is robust and hearty while maintaining a light, herbal character.All in all, a well-rounded pizza, in form and in principle!The only thing I regret is that, since I was with a group each time I went, I could never order my beloved anchovies because of community objection.

Not that our margarita wasn't delishalish! It was just to my liking. Thin, gooey, with tart and sweet tomato sauce. The basil had a shockingly fresh pop--- a sexy little dress for the gooey, slutty mozzerella. I also saw European tourists getting served salad. Woe is them, that salad had big hunks of rinsed tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, and onions. Not tasty. So be aware, say no to expensive starters here--- they are no good, just get the pizzzzza!

4406,Leo C.,0,3,"Food: Lombardi's is what you get if Grimaldi's looked at itself in the mirror. Everything is opposite. I prefer the pizza at Grimaldi's because it is baked better. The pizza here comes out limpy and the crust flat and doughy. The ingredients (mozzarella, sausage, onion, and mushrooms) here are top notch. Clam pizza had sparse clams and after a few tries I've decided that any seafood on pizza is generally not a good idea. The sauce is laid out well, doesn't overflow as you eat. Service: Average service, which is more than Grimaldi's. (FYI, no credit cards accepted)Drink: Had a few problems once, ordered a pitcher of coke which was flat. Told them, and they replied that its being changed right now and we will get another one. Came back, it was flat and told them again. They said sorry and came back with root beer, wtf? Tired of asking, I simply just don't care, but I can imagine if they try to pull that with someone who cares or doesn't like root beer. Crowd/Ambiance: Old school Lombardi's was much better, had more character. The expansion allowed for increase space, more tourists, resulting in higher revenue, but sacrificed on the rustic, original feel. What carried over was the claustrophobic seating and table space.",9/28/2009,219,304,1491,e3QEIZcXtsEnWiui-71TpQ

The pizza itself is fantastic! The crust is crispy on the bottom and soft on top, just the way it should be. The sauce is definitely fresh and naturally sweet, also perfect. Some tips: Considering going with a group of 4 people, if you can manage it. There were tons of people on the ""table for 2"" list, and lots of larger tables were seated ahead of us. At least 3 or 4 parties of 4 arrived after us and were seated well before we were called.

4409,Miss Rza M.,0,5,"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had in my life. Hands down. We were visiting from the south where our pizza crust is either thin and flavorless, or thick and greasy. A native took us to Lombardi's on our first night and it was well worth the 30 minute wait. We ordered the mozzarella and tomato appetizer which was delicious and fresh. It came on a bed of mixed greens so it also had a salad. We split a large pepperoni, Italian sausage, and sauteed spinach pizza. All of the ingredients were very high quality and fresh. The crust was perfect with no additional salt needed. We also split a small white pizza that came with ricotta cheese. This is DEFINITELY worth trying. I have never in my life had a white pizza that I enjoyed, but I enjoyed this one. I keep dreaming about it....and despite the fact that we only have a week left, I think we're going to have to go back to Lombardi's. It also tasted excellent with the red pepper flakes which I usually don't put on my pizza. Each of their pies comes with basil which gives it a depth of flavor that you don't always find. It was kind of pricey, with the total coming to 60.00 for 3 of us. We also ordered a pitcher of soda since they charged for refills. Something else you should know is that it is cash only! They have an ATM in the back, but come prepared. Yes it is crowded, yes it is expensive, but it is totally worth it! Another downside is that because they are so busy, you have to flag down a waiter anytime you need something.

4416,Vanessa S.,0,5,"YUM.That's exactly how I would describe the pizza here. I came here with friends on a busy Saturday evening, and we were seated within ten minutes (even after being given an estimated waiting time of 20 minutes) in a cozy booth in Lombardi's ""second"" room (less chaotic than their main room). We ordered a large white pizza with sausage and spinach, which sufficiently stuffed us three girls. The crust had a nice bready thickness to it (not to be confused with the massiveness of a deep dish), which I found much more appetizing than Grimaldi's flimsy and doughy ""thin"" crust. The mozzarella cheese was dappled in huge thick chunks and was the freshest mozzarella I've tasted yet.The waiters were very good about clearing our dishes immediately after we polished our pizza. While we chatted, the waiters continued to check up on us every few minutes. We found their persistence strange, but we soon got the impression that they wanted us to leave to clear a table for other customers. That's when we realized there was a security camera aimed at our table. Although this didn't bother me, my friend was completely livid by the idea that a hawk-like staff was watching our every move.Regardless, the food was delish and the portions were huge. Our 18"" white pizza (mozzarella, ricotta, romano cheese, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic infused oil, no sauce...drool) had 8 slices and was only $19.50, which was split amongst three people. You can check out their website for their complete menu with toppings and prices.I feel this place is far superior to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. But it really comes down to what kind of crust you like. If you like soft crust, you'll probably be a bigger fan of Grimaldi's. I just prefer having a bit more crisp to my crust.",10/10/2007,98,108,20,ZNZDCWnX7tRlW_5I15ArXA

We ordered the original pizza and bread sticks. Don't order the bread sticks, they were horrible, dry and hard. But I was glad to order them since they came out right away and we were starving. The original pizza was incredible! I'm not really that much of a fan of pizzas but this one I could eat all the time and not feel ill. I'll definitely be going back there next time I'm in town.

4441,Joe G.,0,4,"I'm so torn right now, you REALLY have no idea...3 starts or 4 stars...definitely not 5 but 3 or 4...Well, my girlfriend and I finally made a much anticipated trip to this famed pizzeria. I'm still confused about whether or not I LOVE, or just plain like this much-hyped pie. I expected a wait (after checking reviews on yelp), and I got a bit of a wait, and I didn't mind it though. I actually think it helps the dining experience-the anticipation, smelling the smells, taking in the atmosphere, and feeling the place out. I waited about 15-20 minutes, and got progressively hungrier as the minutes passed. Once my girlfriend and I sat down we already knew what we wanted: a large classic pie with the FREE extra garlic slices. After marveling at how tourists come to Lombardi's to order their favorite Pizza Hut pies with loads of toppings (instead of sticking with the minimalist notion of what pizza SHOULD be) our pizza was soon delivered.  It came out of the coal-oven hot, crispy and steamy...a good start. My girlfriend and I toasted to the pizza gods and bit into our slices. My first bite tasted great I had some cheese, some garlic and some shredded basil...I'm thinking ""good-as-hell...this is amazing."" My second bite however wasn't as good, it lacked the garlic, and the sauce just fell flat. This was the major letdown for me. I tend to think of myself as a sauce expert (my grandfather makes the best sauce you'll ever taste...EVER, no lie) It lacked the flavor punch that the crust and cheese both delivered, it didn't tie the two together. Its almost like a pizza is a three-piece band...the crust is the Drums it provides the beat, the place where the other two ingredients can work from. Lombardi's was excellent. The cheese is the Guitar, the thing most people notice first (its sliced fresh (better) and not grated (worse) at Lombardi's). The sauce acts like the Bass, it ties together the other two instruments. Lombardi's didn't do this.  It doesn't make the pie horrible though, its still really, really good, its just not as great as it could be-as it should be.  I really love the crust, it was the best part of the pie. Because it's so good I really think they should serve a pie thats some olive oil, garlic, and some sprinkles of Romano cheese on some perfectly cooked crust (kind-of what pizza was before it came to the good-ol USA), I think I'd be so good it would honestly take your breath away.  Next time I go I'm trying the white pie, and maybe getting a classic again with double or triple extra garlic. I'd say go and eat and judge it for yourself. Everyone's got different opinions on pizza. Its an awesome place in a cool neighborhood.",7/5/2006,27,60,12,Bq9S6wfZ-mal34lMCajC1w

It was just plain simple pizza, but i think it was the tomato sauce that made it taste that much better... i usually only eat 2-3 pieces of pizza at most, but here, i had about 5 pcs alone! i was so impressed with lombardi's that i didn't even bother visiting grimaldi's. on my last day at nyc, i wanted to try lombardi's again for the last time, so my friend and I came back around noon, and the place was PACKED. They said it was going to be about an hour wait time, but we had a plane to catch very soon, so we had the pizza to-go instead, and ate it on a playground nearby with some boba drinks that we got from chinatown. this was one of my favorite moments in nyc that i'll never forget..",4/6/2012,29,60,19,8OyZRZ1B77yIOIv2yU36hw

I was surprised at the nice decor...even the bathrooms were very clean (although its the size of a broom closet, the wall is probably less than a foot away from the actual throne...I don't know how anyone could do anything but stand next to it)I ordered a beer (their pitchers do about 4 pints for 18 bucks, or single pints are 5 dollars - they have stella, sam adams, brooklyn lager, and one other I can't remember, on tap, more choices by the bottle) and I got the small pie (14"" - 6 Big slices for 16 bucks) with pepperoni and wild mushrooms as extra toppings. The pizza comes standard with tomato sauce, fresh mozarella and sliced basil. It was a 25 minute wait for the pie, so I got started on my beer. Pizza came out not a second too early and I was about to realize why I moved to new york.The nice server brought the pie out and I took a cell phone shot specifically to send to my friends in Northern California who have to survive off of Pizza Hut or Lame-inos. This was the mona lisa...if the mona lisa was made out of leavened dough and mozarella. It was thin with huge cut slices, a nicely charred bottom crust, mounds of melted fresh mozarella and chunky tomato sauce. The pepperoni was the smaller, thicker kind (which I dig), the ""wild mushrooms"" looked like portabella which is always better than your standard white mushroom.I took a bite. The slightly charred, cracker like outer crust has a slightly smokey, slightly bitter taste. The crunch then gives way to a soft, thin, yeasty interior with a nice chew. The perfect balance of texture. On the top I got the snap of the fresh mozarella, lots of fresh tasting chunky tomato, crisp pepperoni, fresh aromatic basil and meaty mushrooms...all of this in one bite. The thing that really stood out was how fresh everything tasted.I ate the whole pizza by myself. (For the person that said you have to go with someone else, although for most people this is true)This is better than any pizza I had in Italy (For the person who said it doesn't compare)I went around 4:30...random time I know, there was no line up at that time so if you wanna beat the crowd you may wanna go at an in between time.I highly recommend this place. Now that I think of it, since I'm completely new to the city, I got off on Spring St. and didn't even realize how far away 32 Spring St. was. I ended up walking over 15 blocks to get to the place.

I'm from California, Bay Area to be exact... and realized there is no better pizza than New York's (well.. unless you go to Chicago and try their deep dish authentic pizza, but that's a debate and yelp for another day) My cousins from Jersey, brought me to Lombardi's and what a delightful treat and experience I had. It is supposed to be the ""1st pizzeria"" and if it is or isn't is a topic of discussion at a coffee shop, but it is definitely the best thin crust, coal oven baked pizza I have ever had! We had 2 pizzas, the Margherita and another which just had meatballs and spinach. The margherita was yummy, but the meatballs and spinach one was exquisite. They made the meatballs pretty big ( and I love big balls...meatballs that is) and full of flavor. The crust was not burnt or too doughy (something I realized Califas' pizzas had) but just crisp enough for that perfect crunch sound. I enjoyed my pizza with a glass of sangria (also very good). My cousin however, had a Peroni beer and it was a bit warm and had to request a glass with ice. But other than that... the pizza is by far the best pizza! The place is also full of pictures of its history and celebrities that frequent the place. We did manage to see Radika from NY's Top Chef enjoying pizza a table away.

Our bill came to a total of $43 + tip which included a small pizza, breadsticks and 2 drinks. A little bit expensive but we did not mind if the pizza was out of this world like it boasted. Honestly? The sauce was okay. The mushroom tasted uncooked. The pepperoni and cheese was amazing though. The crust was a little dry. The breadsticks were, well, BREAD sticks. They really were just bread in the shape of a stick. Not very impressive for $8. The sauce, again, was mediocre. The drinks? We order a vanilla Italian soda and a beer. Again, both were very mediocre. Nothing impressive. The line was ridiculous for a pizza place. We waited about 40 minutes until we were seated. The service was good since the workers/waiters were all very polite and nice. The total experience? Not at all worth it. I rather grab a slice of pizza at a random cafe elsewhere.

4462,Jen L.,0,5,"Original pizza parlor is what Lombardi's Pizza is dubbed with. They should also be dubbed with ""BOMB ASS PIZZA PARLOR"". I've heard a lot of good things about Lombardi's Pizza and finally, after my third visit to the Big Apple, I've tried this ever so reputable establishment. Their pizza crust is baked to perfection. Chewy, warm dough inside and outside has a bitter-like undertone that can only be achieved through a coal oven.  Coal oven pizza is orgasmic. Not to mention their fresh red sauce and savory meat toppings. I'm not a fan of meat on my pizza but this is the mother ship location for meat lovers seeking a meaty pizza.  I like how Lombardi's sparingly uses cheese (fresh mozzarella!) on it. Plus it makes it easier for me to just pick it out! Can I haz some right now? Droolz.The size of the restaurant can be very deceiving. I thought it was just a small restaurant, but when when our server took us through the nooks and crannies of this delicious and divine haven, we found out this is actually spacier than what it seems like at the front of the restaurant.

Pros:  Their sauce is great and the amount of cheese is perfect.Cons:  Staff is becoming increasingly rude,  too many tacky tourists, cash only policy.",11/21/2011,0,41,0,R_c3pjOmARgXFgL4qe-XzQ

Pretty looking but yet, not spice added, it was a bland pizza. I had requested for more basil and added lots of salt to enjoy even a slice. Oh well, it would be that we were full to begin with.

The tomato sauce was nice and chunky the way I like it but it could use a little more seasoning in it. The part that I really didnt like was the crust! My jaw hurt just chewing it! It was crispy maybe a little too much but the bad thing was that it was chewy and it was a tad bit burnt. I do enjoy the pizza here and its in manhattan which is great but overall I dont think its the BEST pizza NYC has to offer.

Also, I had a really good experience here, so 5 it will be.The pizza. Duh. It's good. It's ""gourmet pizza,"" as I like to call it, which means it won't be that congealed cheesy, oily slice you'll find at those hole-in-the-walls (not that they're not good, it's just a whole different category of pizza). This is a legit pizzeria. They use fresh basil and buffalo cheese, and you can taste each flavor in every bite.I know very well that Lombardi's stirs up a lot of attention and usually, I see tons of people waiting in line. But when I went, on a Tuesday night with 3 others, we were seated in a matter of minutes, and treated very cordially. The waitress wasn't the most pleasant waitress I have been served by, but she did what she had to - took our order and brought our pizza.The key, if you want to have a good experience, at Lombardi's, and any other restaurant that has a high volume of customers, is to plan on going a random week night as opposed to a busy weekend.

As we arrived in Manhattan, my friend in NY guided us to the SoHo area and gave us our first taste of New York. When we arrived at Lombardi's, the wait wasn't long. I was a bit surprised, but I guess it was a weekday night. By now, I was extremely tired and somewhat hungry. In my opinion, this was one of the best pizzas I've had in my life. Not sure if I would dub it THE best pizza I've had, but it's definitely up there on my list. My friend thinks I'm crazy for loving bread. I'm not sure, but I think he also thought I was crazy for thinking Lombardi's crust was really tasty. I personally thought the crust was the highlight of their pizza. You all probably think I'm crazy for loving the crust. I thought it was so tasty that I could eat their crust alone as a snack. Now the sauce was light, but IMO complemented the rest of the pizza well. The mozzarella was good, although I wouldn't say it was anything special. We got several toppings (pepperoni, spinach, mushrooms, meatballs), which I thought might overpower the overall taste. However, to my surprise, all of the toppings tasted great together. I wouldn't consider any of them a weak link, but my girlfriend thought the mushrooms sucked. I thought they all played an important role in the yummy-ness. I guess the important question is ""Will I come again?"" The answer is a definite YES. On my next trip to New York, Lombardi's will be on my list without a doubt.

When he came to deliver our bill (which wasn't too bad at all given NYC) I was joking with Jesus telling hin if they bottled up that dressing they could make a fortune (it's that good).  He told me to wait a minute and he went somewhere in the back, came back to our table and told me that they would sell me a jar of it for blank dollars.  I immediately said of cousre I'd love a jar of the dressing.  As he had already dropped off the check he hadn't added to the price to the check, so he entrusted me that I was going to pay it. When he came back to the table with the mason jar filled with the dressing, he told me it would be good for about 2 weeks and to shake and it check it.  Right then and there I knew this was a house made dressing from scratch.Thank you Lomabardi's and thank you Jesus!",10/9/2012,4,11,0,kpqcDNx9EM2tGkXpFn5F_A

Good news is the line moves. The place may look small but its actually very large once you get seated you will see the entire place. The best part about the upstairs seating is you get to walk through the kitchen and see the pizzas come out of the original oven which is way cool. Only part we where not happy with was it took forever to bring us our food and the tables in our area where so close to each other you could not move. If you sit upstairs oddly enough the floor gets HOT so dont put you bags on the floor as my shopping bag almost melted to the floor I am NOT kidding about that eather.,10/4/2014,0,280,0,qoNQo-kLOsNQGMCFwmSpRg

Switched them out for a tossed salad, which was quite puny for $7.50, and barely had any fixings. They have a decent beer selection, but don't carry Bud Light, Miller, etc.... kind of a bummer.

4516,Sameer A.,0,4,"A true NY pizza, well it has to be, since this is the pizza that started it all, . . . allegedly. Lombardi brings it, good crispy crust, fresh sauce, nice mozzarella cheese. Huge location, you dont feel crowded or claustrophobic. I've heard good things about the clam pizza, but never had a chance to be part of a group that wants to try it. Negatives: Pricey, but i guess you pay for historyWhite pizza, a little too much ricotta, too rich, maybe needs some shaved garlic to cut through the fatSauted spinach can make the pizza a tad soggy.

I have them put extra veggies and cheese on everything and I look forward to visiting this place like a kid looks forward to Halloween.

After they called out name, we were seated downstairs, which was a madhouse of small tables barely fitting these huge pie trays on top! We ended up ordering three pies- Tomato and basil, a three cheese pizza, and pepperoni and sausage. Tomato and basil--over sauced and sogggggy Three cheese--under sauced and veryy dry! Pep & Sausage--normal-nothing spectacular or specifically wrong. Wine was also a bit warm for my taste- I guess this is really a place where everyone hyped it up and I had too high of expectations.

4524,Andrew W.,0,3,"This place has been so heavily yelped I'm relunctant to add my two cents, but do have some thoughts to add here.Lombardi's is very good pizza. It's better than what you can get at your local pizza joint and I'm all about  the hot coal oven, but I think they're resting on their laurels here being the oldest pizza place in New York. See my review of Grimaldi's - Lombardi's can't hold their jock.I brought a buddy from out of town here trying to impress him with one of New York's great institutions and happened to be a place I had yet to visit. I don't think it made the full impression. With the so-so ingredients that produce uneven crust quality, glossy menus, rushed service and waiters wearing ear pieces, it just felt like we were in a tourist trap. The pie we ordered, with extra muzz and a couple toppings came to $21. The toppings were OK (liked the mushrooms), too much tomato sauce, had slightly soggy crust in the middle, probably because of too much sauce (but great on the edges). Even with the extra muzz, it still seemed very skimpy there. Fortunately on a Friday night at peak hour (keep in mind it was the summer) there was no wait, but aside from that, not much great going on here. My buddy wondered why they didn't take Credit Cards, so I said that it was one of those great New York Pizzaria's that can say ""F--- you, we're a great New York Institution so we don't have to do slices or Credit Cards."" He gave me a rather unimpressed look back. I guess that sums it up.",6/25/2007,34,371,0,VveQW3yKqgi8gAjwKzUVBg

Pizza was both undercooked and lacked any distinctive flavor. Service was poor in the sense that staff didn't share a sense of pride in what the place offers or gives any sense of guiding on the menu- they were merely order takers. Told my brother( who lives in Brooklyn)that I went here for lunch and he shared my sentiment. He mentioned Di Fara and Franks Pizza in Brooklyn as true NY experiences.N.B I went to Pizzeria Delfina in SF a few weeks later and it was awesome.

4530,John P.,0,5,"This place makes my Top Five list for best pizza in the US. There are a couple places in Chicago who are right there with them, as well as one in LA, and another in New York. No, I haven't tried that place in Arizona. The crust was perfect: crispy with a good bite and a little chewy. The cheese and toppings rivaled pizzas I have had in Italy. You simply cannot beat a coal or wood oven pizza. If you live in New York, and don't care for Lombardi's, quit your whining and learn to appreciate the amazing pizza you have access to. Be thankful you don't live in some other crap hole around the US where people are forced to order from Pizza Hut. If your just a lame tourist like me, this place is worth the wait. Pull the DS or iPhone out of the fanny pack to help pass the time.By the way, what in the hell is up with reviewers on Yelp being so stingy with stars? You are a loser who spends your spare time writing reviews for restaurants on the internet. You do not work for Michelin! If the place is good and you will return, then give them the stars to prove it.

I've taken several visiting family members here and they have all loved the pizza as well. Lombardi's is usually packed at lunch and dinner (go a bit off the lunch and dinner rush if you want quicker seating), but be prepared to wait a little bit at any time. The restaurant is actually fairly large with a backroom and more seating upstairs. The staff is quick with serving you so once you're in you don't have to wait too much longer for food.

The crust is somehow perfect to all who eat it - thick and thin crust lovers alike. You have to try it for yourself to know. The coal oven must be magical. The menu is simple. A few salads, and pizza. No pastas, no meatball sandwiches, just pizza. The standard comes w/ tomato sauce (the best I've tasted) and fresh mozzarella, fresh garlic is optional and free of charge. Additional toppings are extra.Worth trying - the pepperoni. They are small circles (about quarter size), not the domino's kind you might be used to. They are also thicker sliced, so when they are in the oven, the edges curl up and get crispy and oh so good. Add fresh garlic and its even more special.

We were all really excited to try the pizza given all of the reviews on yelp boasting 'the best thin crust pizza'. We opened our pizza boxes and they looked beautiful and well put together. Then we picked up a piece to get this pizza party started and it was limp and not crispy. The white pizza was weighed down with so much cheese, yuck. So we picked off all of the huge ice cream scoop sized dollops of ricotta to make it edible. The crust towards the very edges was delicious. But the middle of the pie wasn't worth eating and when you consider the $60 we paid we should be able to enjoy the whole thing. What I do know is delivery can be a huge factor in the quality of food. And I cannot in anyway speak of the quality for dine in.

I had to think twice about putting my name in for the 35 minute wait at 9:30pm, and after seeing 50 people waiting outside. However I decided to wait after learning that they offered some of the best pizza in the country.That being said, I'm not sure what makes this pizza so special. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty and my friend and I polished off a 14"" small pizza and salad (we were famished). We ordered a half margherita pizza, and half pepperoni. I preferred the pepperoni- I love it when the pepperoni is super crispy (which it was). The ingredients tasted really fresh, the sauce was very good, and I like the thin crispy crust. All in all, it was a cool experience since Lombardi's is so well known. The pizza was good... just not spectacular.

My flippant, dismissive attitude was going to get shoved back down my throat behind a torrent of pizza that night.All we ordered were: 1) Tequila shots. 2) a large Pepperoni.

4559,Jackie L.,0,5,"I'm in love with Lomabrdi's pizza. Truthfully speakiing, its nothing special its just a pizza, made very well, that is delicious. It's simple perfection is what has charmed me. The Lombardi Pizza is:-a very good thin crust that tastes more like a flatbread than any other pizza crust I've had. Only slightly crisp and slightly soft and chewy and not burnt, uneven, or disfigured in any way.- simple tomato sauce thats tastes like tomatoes. not runny, not thick...perfect and verrry lightly seasoned if at all with a hint of garlic.-fresh, thick slices of mozzarella, evenly proprotioned throughout the pie to insure every bite is the same. My first bite resulted in a string of mozzarella from pizza to mouth.End result is my dream pizza. Not fancy lke Di fara's and not as raw and rough aroud th edges as Tottonos rather somweher in between, just right...the goldilocks of nyc pizza. Equally as amazing was their white pie which can't be compared to anything else because nobody else makes it they way do. I might've even liked it more than the ""red"" pie. Besides having no sauce being covered in mozzarella and specks of  herbs there are generous cream puff shaped dollops of ricotta cheese. Loved the friendly host and waiters. Loved the casual atmosphere. Love loooove the pizza.",11/6/2007,29,107,0,YxQfDjLx0MJeFjtoTTp_EA
4560,Junior S.,0,4,"The pizza here is very good, but when you start throwing around phrases like ""Best Pizza in NYC,"" Lombardi's is not quite up to par. One of the first things you'll notice is that it doesn't have much in the way of atmosphere.  There are a ton of tourists here and it kinda feels like you are in a T.G.I. Friday's -- very commercialized.    You also get the feeling that about as many Italians work here as a place specializing in takeout Chinese.  The pizza itself is really good, but not markedly better than similar pies at lesser known places.  The thing that really makes the pizza good at Lombardi's is the fresh mozzarella, and you can find cheese just as good (or better) at another pizzeria without having to wait for awhile. Bottom line:  Lombardi's is well known not so much because they have the best pizza, but because they are the first pizzeria in the United States.  So if you're a tourist, go to Lombardi's b/c that's a neat piece of history to take home with you.  If you're a New Yorker, you can do better.",4/12/2008,10,69,0,epb_3m56cKLERmpX2sLIRA

4563,Marleigh M.,0,4,"Yummy, yummy, yummy! A quest for the best pizza in the city is not complete without a visit to Lombardi's. This was actually my second trip to the nation's oldest pizza eatery (est. 1897) located in Nolita. I cannot say it took the prize for ""best pizza in nyc,"" but it definitely tied for third place. TheStageManager and I arrived on a Friday evening to a 15 minute wait. We took advantage of our spare time and immediately sat at the bar ordering a glass of wine each. About 10 minutes later, a table opened up on the other side of the restaurant. We were led down the dining area, through the kitchen, out the other side of the ""U-shaped"" restaurant and seated next to the brick wall on the right.  We ordered a medium size pizza with the following 5 toppings: red onions, olives, sliced tomatoes, red peppers, and ricotta cheese. Man oh man, was it delicious. I ate three of the six slices with my fork. I used to have a saying that you know you have good pizza when you have to eat it with a fork; that's exactly what I had was good pizza. The restaurant was big for Manhattan; people were not seated on top of each other as you find in many other pizza parlors. The medium size pizza was perfect for two people and the toppings were a delicious combo leaning on perfection. Although the pizza could have been a bit crispier, I enjoyed every minute of it. The wait was not as bad as I expected; the server was friendly; and the prices were cheap. I cannot wait to go back.",1/15/2009,61,68,2,y6_naue0vxwlRhK7TYjyQw
4564,Kevin K.,0,4,"Just flew into New York for New Year's Eve (2006). I heard nothing but great things about Lombardi's Pizza and they were right!I usually do not go crazy over pizza but coming from Los Angeles, I was always intrigued by pizzerias in other cities, especially New York. Since I do not recall what toppings I ordered on my pizza, I'll just give you guys a quick summary.Because of the holiday and it was on a Friday night, it was extremely packed. I believe I waited in line for 1hr and 45 minutes. Was it worth the wait? You bet cha! The pizza was very soft, had a lot of tomato sauce, and the toppings were delicious. Why no 5 star you ask? Well, I felt the pizza should include at least one topping when ordering. As I recalled I had to pay for each topping (a total of 3), and the pizza itself was already quite expensive (do not recall the price, but should be between $18-20). Like most reviews, the price is a little steep for pizza. The price for the toppings weren't cheap either. Ranging from $3-4 each topping. So you can imagine how expensive a pizza can get. I came with a family of 5 and we ordered 3 pizza with about 2-3 toppings each. Finished all of it.",1/22/2009,215,175,50,Hb6LUSM-JH5JV5jV3GqVoQ

Although a side note here would be that occasionally on saturday evenings, the delivery can take a bit longer, but I have never experienced poor quality.I am a big fan of the original pizza, but with extra riccotta. (ordering extra cheese is an option for all those people who seem to have a problem with the fact that this traditional pizza does not ooze with cheese; I like the combination of the mozzarella and the ricotta...). I also always get the cesar salad (order the dressing on the side for 2 reasons-they totally overdress the salad, as most do, and with the amount of dressing that they give you on the side, you can add extra lettuce and have a large salad enough for 3 people). The cesar salad is really, consistently good, as is the pizza. I really like Archie's quote because it is so true! Lombardi's becomes addictive, and with the salad and not too much cheese, I can convince myself it is not fattening.....As far as people who seem to want to eviscerate this place, let up. It is ""traditional"" meaning not americanized, overly cheesey, pepperoni pizza. As for someone who starts drinking at 3 in the afternoon, and is surprised when he doesn't wake up naked being-what was it?-humped by an animal, I don't think his opinion should matter much to anyone (not including the fact that he would prefer digiorno's pizza...frozen, no less).But go, see for yourself.

It happens sometimes, I'd say in my experience ordering from here I've had that burn taste probably 35% of the time.Other than that, I love the pizza here.

The restaurant is too small for strollers so they 'check' it for you at the door. No room for high chairs either, only booster seats.

4606,Pete W.,0,4,So the previous day we had Grimaldi's so I wanted to compare styles. We has pepperoni and sausage just like Grimaldi's. I like Lombardi's a lot better. The pepperoni had a good flavor and was spicier and the sauce was more tangy. We got a small pizza which was plenty for two people. The crust was good and we split a pitcher of coke. People complained about speed and long wait but we got seated right away and we went Sunday  early afternoon. Service was quick and our server was very friendly. Remember cash only.

They were also pretty stingy with the amount of meat, and for the high price I'd expect a lot more toppings. Boo-urns. I expected more for New York pizza.

4612,Brian H.,0,5,"Lombardi's is naturally a big tourist destination. It was the first pizzeria in the country. Genaro Lombardi brought his tomato pies to Little Italy in 1905 and the rest is history. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly the waiting list moved. It took only about 10 or 15 minutes for them to call my name. We were led through one room after another, passing families and couples enjoying pizza. The enormity of this maze-like restaurant was a little surreal. One false turn and you'd end up in the kitchen.I started with the margherita, which noticeably had more tomato than anything else. It's clear that this pizza (and therefore all pizza) is a direct descendant of what was originally called a tomato pie. There were nicely distributed perfectly melted globs of fresh mozzarella and some garnishes of fresh basil.The crust was nicely charred, although some slices were crispier than others, and had a slight smoky flavor. The abundant tomato sauce was fresh and well-seasoned with just a hint of sweetness. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a more generous serving of basil, but the tomato sauce was so perfectly seasoned that it really wasn't necessary aside from aesthetics.Their famous clam pie was worth the $26.95 spent on the 14 inches. The pie was crowded with fresh clams (I was pleasantly surprised that these didn't come from a can) and garnished with a lemon. The clams were chewy and delicious and all the flavors came together like an Italian masterpiece. This could have been incredibly heavy and decadent since it features all the ingredients for a nice linguini white sauce. But it was really just right. And I was amazed that the light thin crust held up the weight of those beautiful bivalves.Now this was my first ever visit to Lombardi's so I can't say how or if the quality has changed, but I can confidently say that they still have fantastic pizza.-eatthisny",3/28/2009,41,121,0,QvfOVPM49SySj1CiPGhmBQ
4613,Kaylin O.,0,4,My friends and I were visiting the city walking around exploring the different neighborhoods. We had dim sum in Chinatown and decided to walk to Little Italy.  We decided to spend the latter part of the day in Little Italy but realized that Little Italy was very small and boring.  We wanted to have dinner here so we decided to just hang around a bit.  We ended up having an early dinner at like 3 pm at Lombardi.  We noticed a line and we started talking to them.  We found out this is one of the best Pizza in town so we decided we're going to eat here.I'm glad we dawdled in Little Italy and found this place. They did have the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  The sauce is great.  The toppings were fresh and great.  I came back a second time when I was in NYC and it wasn't as good as the first time around.  It might have to do with the toppings. I chose different toppings this time around.,2/11/2010,231,904,308,3JgcaZf9MLt4Q5hbZ6Pwxw

4615,Jezzika C.,0,5,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!^ That's how I feel about Lombardi's Pizza.I recently took a trip to NYC and stayed at the SoHotel, which was a few blocks away from Lombardi's. I passed this place a few times during the first few days I was there, and it always seemed to be packed and busy. After reading the raving reviews about the ""first pizzeria in America"" and a recommendation from my New Yorker Aunt, I was convinced I had to try this place. I went with a group of 8 people at dinnertime, and although they told us the wait would only be 10 minutes, we ended up waiting around 20-25 minutes. That was the only negative part about the experience. For the 8 of us, we ordered 2 large pizzas: the white pizza & the original pizza with homemade meatballs as a topping. We got 2 slices each, and that seemed to be a good amount- it was satisfying, but not overly filling. We also only spent about $6-8 bucks each! The slices were pretty big, the crust was perfectly crispy, and the sauce/toppings were TO DIE FOR. I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza because I think the crust is the best part of a pizza, but I LOVED this pizza. I think they bake the pizza in a 800 degree coal oven for 3-4 minutes, which explains the unique taste. The white pizza's cheeses had GREAT flavor! A lot of the time with white pizzas, the cheeses tend to taste bland and the flavors blend together and aren't strong enough. That wasn't the case with Lombardi's white pizza! The original pizza's sauce tasted amazing, and the MEATBALLS WERE SO DELICIOUS. I've never tasted such delicious meat on a pizza before. This place is consistently voted among the top pizza places in America every year, and you will know why once you try it! It's also been featured on multiple food channels, and everyone from native New Yorkers to tourists love this place. THEY EVEN HAVE FREE DELIVERY!! If I lived in this area, I would probably order Lombardi's every week. You may think that pizza is pizza, and there's only so many ways to make it. Lombardi's is an original, and they KNOW their pizza. Whatever makes it different, you can definitely taste it. I'm craving it as I type this review. It's also in a GREAT location, so you have lots of other things to do in this area before/after your meal. Rice to Riches is right across the street, and it's a great place to grab dessert after! Prince and Broadway (where all the stores like Uniqlo, H&M, Zara, TopShop, etc. are) is also right around the corner, so you can do a little shopping while you're over there!",10/13/2014,103,59,17,by2RIMdpOMR8u1mBfsbcUw
4616,Henry M.,0,5,"This is among the very best pizza in the WORLD, not just in NYC.

So, we headed there for lunch. Once we were there, we discovered the place had been renovated and there weren't any baked clams on the menu. I like a balanced meal so I ordered a salad which was huge since my friend refused to eat any of it. It didn't have enough dressing but the waitress was quick to give me more. We ordered the sausage and onion pizza. The cheese and sauce were really great. But the actual pizza was floppy and so burning hot that I couldn't fold it properly and ended up eating it with a knife and fork.We met another out-of-town couple at the place and they were doing the tourist thing of taking photos of everything and called out to us often to see if we liked the pizza. They also called people on their cell phone and exclaimed excitedly about their pie. They had heard about Lombardi's on the Food Network. It was pretty funny. If we were thinking properly, we should have asked to sit with them so we could try their pizza too.

4626,Rick R.,0,3,"I'm a huge pizza fan and have tried tons of different styles of pizza including the thin crust style coal oven pizza they serve here. It's good but not the best. The sauce needed a liitle more flavor, I had to put salt and pepper flakes on the pie to kick it up a little. I also had a slice with maybe a stamp size amount of cheese, careless.  I also had to ask for parmashan cheese to put around the crust area because basically it was a ring of just tomato sauce by about an inch. The crust is top notch, 100% but I was expecting a little more. I ate just the cheese Margrita, I'm not a huge toppings fan. I think that's the ultimate way to judge pizza is a classic Margrita and that's what I ate. I was good but not the ""best pizza in the planet"", whoever said that from zagats needs to travel more. I really do appreciate the history of the place and the story. It's cool to see where all other pizza in the us was based from but it still doesn't make the pizza any better.

4642,Geoff L.,0,4,"Really tasty pizza. The crust is thin, crispy and perfect. The sauce and cheese are tasty but fairly light, so you can put down 3 slices with no problem. My friend and I split a small Gennaro's Original Pizza (6 slices of Lombardi's ""standard pizza made with fresh mozzarella, a San Marzano tomato sauce and topped with romano and fresh basil) and we were pleasantly full but not stuffed. It did cost $25 with tip though. Also, be warned, they don't do slices. I tried coming here for lunch yesterday, but I didn't have time to wait for a whole pizza so I went across the street to Pomodoro. I gave both of them 4 stars because they're both very good and represent some of the best pizza in New York, but they're very different styles so I recommend trying both if you really want a taste of Little Italy.",7/11/2008,191,186,626,HXLtUj52n24xOHZyXBaTmQ
4643,Karen J.,0,3,"My little brother and his wife were in town for the weekend and pretty much where attempting to each their way through NYC.  Being a great sister and tour guide, I offered my ideas and stomach to the task.  I had heard Lombardi's was good and thought we'd give it a try after a friend recommended it.  We went on a Sunday night a little late but that was a great idea as we missed any silly wait time.  We waited a couple of minutes but that time was needed anyways to get a beer from the bar. We ordered a medium pizza (perfect size for 3 people) that had onions, peppers and sausage.  I thought it was very good.  But was a little disappointed when some parts of the crust came out burnt on the bottom.  Who wants to eat what now tastes like the inside of a coal burning stove, not me please! Though good I wouldn't consider it the best pizza I have ever had.  If I am in the area and the line is not too long I might give it a try again.  Otherwise, I will continue my quest for the perfect pie at other locations.",8/5/2008,30,201,0,Y5ubWFnk2FRinbkFusxE5w

The quality & standards for NY pizza just keeps declining & it's important to remember that we've still got the best of the best!  But I was raised on NY pizza & I'm always looking for that special taste that only comes in a NYC legendary pizza parlor like Lombardi's, Di Fara's & Grimaldi's.  You know that you're eating great pizza when you just keep on eating it, even though you're already full. Lombardi's pizza is that way. The cheese isn't overwhelming & the dough & sauce is divine. magic.It's a tough choice, but I keep choosing Lombardi's. Maybe it's their reputation & history that makes me rank it as tops, or maybe it's just the fact that they have a Clam Pie & it's DELICIOUS! be brave & try it already!

Second place is for Grimaldi's, then all the rest.Incomparable freshness, unique combination of intense flavors, make your own combination and prepare to be delighted. Something I tasted in my most recent visit was the calzone with cheese (mozzarella + ricotta), simply put: off the hook! Another thing that I like about Lombardi's is that they have rented (or maybe bought out) some extra space around the original location so they can accommodate a larger clientele. It's comfortable and the long line problem has improved, short waiting times. They also take your name on a list and you can go somewhere else and come back for your table.Save some space in your stomach for dessert.

The meatballs were good and the cheese delicious, but other than that... It was expensive, and the pizza wasn't even hot. It felt like it was already done, they threw the meatballs on top of it and heated it a little. The Bruschetta was very good though. That first bite was a glorious moment for my taste buds. Other than that, the servers were uninterested and couldn't care less about us (the customers). I left a $3 tip for a $37 bill and my husband said it was too much.

I ordered a 14 inch pizza with half cheese and half onions and mushrooms(not the best choice). The Margherita(cheese) side was really good! However, the vegetarian side was kind of weak. The downfall of the pizza was the crust. It was not cooked well; therefore, the pizza was flimsy and hard to cut. Toppings would constantly fall off; thus, making it a little annoying. Also there was an overload of the toppings where you could not see the pizza! The best part was the sauce. The sauce was Amazing and had a great taste giving a feel of Italy.

4660,Art L.,1,4,"Here are my two cents on Lombardi's.  You should go and not because it is well known amongst the tourists, but because they really do make a good pizza.  I had the regular Neapolitan.  The qualities that really stood out were the moderate thickness of the crust (not super-thin Neapolitan) and the chewiness.  I'm a big fan of texture.  The toppings were all fresh, without going into too much detail. As I recall the prices were in the moderate zone $10 to $20 depending on the size and toppings, not quite cheapo... In the final analysis, my visit was very satisfying. A word on the dining room: this pizzeria is located inside a late 19th or early 20th century tenement building, so seating is quite tight inside.  Remember to breathe in when walking in!",10/28/2009,78,398,583,OZexlK3A3IN-6LGz3ywQjw

Although the bread wasn't as crispy as I had hoped for, the fresh tomatoes, basil, and garlic made up for it! The tomatoes were piled high, it was like an explosion of sweety tomato-ey goodness in my mouth! The garlic was not too overpowering, either.

The edge was so crispy and thought to be the best part IMO.  We had Nick's pizza in Queens 2 days ago with the same toppings + olives and capers. I think Nick's pizza was better but Bf also liked Lombardi's a lot.    Later, we found out the biggest challenge in this place was the unisex rest room.   The toilet was facing to wall with a leg room of only several inches.  Even petite as I am find it difficult to use.  What about the chevalier?",5/9/2014Previous review,7,292,78,ErN45NaxbX5qumx9s4qr3w
4677,Joe M.,0,3,"Beware of moving to Brooklyn. Such an action inevitably changes one's world view. This is one of two factors forcing this writer to reassess the pizzeria that formerly held his ""best of all time"" pennant.Having recently returned to Lombardi's -- probably for the first time in a year and a half, and for only the second or third time since the eatery's renovation and enlargement -- the experience has become somewhat underwhelming.As someone who first enjoyed Lombardi's pizza in 1998, this humble reviewer had a broad range of memories to draw upon. Back in this pre-history, lines of impatient patrons would coil around the corner, a tense spring foreshadowing long waits even after being seated inside what was, at best, a smoky, claustrophobic dungeon. But the pizza served amidst this ""backyard underground picnic"" ambiance was simply spectacular -- the platinum standard by which all other examples could be judged.But time passes, and some institutions must be reevaluated.Firstly, after more than a year of experiencing pizza in several of Brooklyn's best locations, one grows spoiled. Even aside from Grimaldi's, with which Lombardi's pizza used to be almost identical -- and where one can still enjoy the experience of taking repeated, mid-meal strikes to the kidneys from a neighbor's elbow -- Brooklyn's pizza shines. A security guard once pinned this reviewer's parents to a table in the Brooklyn Museum Café, insistently touting Anthony's Brick Over Pizza (of Park Slope) as home of one of the best pies in the entire city. On a good day, this may well be true. And newcomer Enzo's (also brick oven) has, in less than a year of operation, refined their methods to the point where this reviewer nearly hyperventilated last week over a brilliantly charred margherita.Secondly, while the main eating area of Lombardi's is larger and prettied up, apparently the kitchen has changed as well, and this change carries over to the end product. When did the crust get so flat and gummy? Where have the bubbles gone? Where are the char marks from the searing heat of the coal oven -- and if they are gone, someone please tell us, exactly, what is the point of burning this sort of fossil fuel in the first place?This is still great pizza, better than average even in a city like New York, which arguably offers the world's best. But it is now inferior to several other options. It is sad to see a long-time star fade. But a few newer stars shine more brightly.",5/8/2008,48,45,7,ukTCeWJ8tkaXnz_CMlE2Dg

4686,Matthew L.,0,5,"I've been here twice now before writing this review. Every time I went it was late on a Friday night and we were always seated immediately. Cash ONLY! It has the reputation for a reason. This place makes great pizza and it is very reasonably priced. They use fresh mozzarella and you can taste the difference. You can tell they just sliced it, it's not some cheap pre-shredded junk you get at the supermarket. The sauce is also quite good. Definitely not from a jar. I find the sauce to be lacking in quantity. I think it's silly that they offer that as an ingredient just like meatballs or whatever you want added to your pizza. My one friend thought he got jipped when he pulled a slice and it had ""no cheese"" on it. To his surprise, the cheese hidden under the sauce. For all of you out there not familiar with these thin crust joints, they don't do a layer of sauce on the bottom like Dominos, they layer the cheese and spoon on the sauce Jackson Pollack style. It prevents the thin crust from getting soggy during cooking (all 6 minutes of it).  Suffice it to say, the very high heat gives you a nice artisan crust and the pizza comes to your table in a jiffy. We usually stay under 3 toppings, cuz it gets pricey (esp w/ the sun dried tomatoes). Since I always go in a group, nobody wants to split a white pizza... but that's something I definitely want to try next time I come (I'll just get a small for myself). Also, that may sound like a lot, but the crust is really thin and the pizza is not that heavy. I'd say most people can do 1/2 a large without too much trouble. There have been a lot of poor reviews lately. Luckily my experiences here have always been great (maybe it's the company I keep?). My suggestion to newcomers, definitely try this place out for yourself. Probably coming later to avoid the crowds would be best. Afterward, head over to rice to riches for dessert. It's a nice way to end a date.",2/3/2010,18,52,4,Zc_xc2h2Ev5lF9hwMus5sg

4688,Peter G.,0,5,Still the first and the best! Best tasting pizza on this planet. The secret is in the dough and in the brick oven. Most toppings are outstanding. Tomatoes that accompany mozzarella starter are so fresh you'd think they grew in an on-site garden. Love the pitchers of beer. Service has improved. Added dining space helps.

4690,john g.,0,4,"Indeed, excellent pizza, though there are many other places in New York with pizza just as good that are not quite as expensive, far less crowded, and where you can use a credit card! We got here at 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, and had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  We were seated in a narrow overflow"" section that was accessed through the kitchen.Base price for a large was $23 to which you add toppings @ $3-4 each.  Overall, very good experience but the combination wait time, price and cash only will motivate us to try other places in the future.",6/29/2014,0,19,0,uO_zMs-RGpDTT_Wr1Ixn4A
4691,Andrew W.,0,3,"Walked right in and was seated immediately on a Sunday afternoon with guests from out of town.  The place has the atmosphere of Uno's to me, kitschy red checkered table cloths and an over-riding sense that the place is resting on its past glory and fame.  The lay-out of the restaurant is quite odd and the atmosphere is lacking.  However, the pizza is reasonably priced for the location and you get what you pay for.  The crust has a slight char to it from the coal oven and is pretty tasty.  Maybe not the ultimate, but certainly very good.Take a few pictures, revel in the joy of being at a famous pizza place, and check it off the bucket list.  Food is 4 starService and atmosphere are 3 star.",3/14/2010,4,65,0,5YNG-EjtJhlTenszwHZj4g

I don't think I would wait an hour to eat here, though; there are like 14 other pizzerias in this neighborhood who do it well, and by the slice.Beware of vegetarian toppings; they make the crust soggy.

Expensive, but arguably worth it. We even got one with no cheese and it was still a hit. You can't say the same about a cheesless pizza from Domino's, for example!

4698,John T.,0,4,"I always wanted to try this place, but somehow never have gotten around to it.Let's consider the situation rectified.I ordered the plain, small pie - just mozzarella and sauce. I didn't want to muck it up with any competing flavors.The pie exceeded my expectations. I am a fan of both Patsy's, in Harlem, and Louie and Ernie's in the Bronx,  both thin crust type places.This pie was similar to both of those places in the crust department, but the sauce was different - sweeter and fresher tasting. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it reminded me of the pizza we used to make at home when we were kids - the crust was never any good, but the sauce was always delicious.So here we have that sauce married to a crispy, well charred , chewy yet crispy crust, and that spells pizza happiness.The service was fine. The small pie was $12.50 - extra stuff costs three bucks or so more per itemI didn't notice if pizza by the slice was available - but the small pie yielded 6 slices - enough for two people to eat their fill.I'm glad I finally made it in.",12/16/2013,0,16,1,CYxLwLMNxWHFAmqAJcbv4A

The bf & I shared a small marg + red onions + homemade meatballs. The crust was crunchy but fluffly sweet goodness. I wish all pizza crust came this way! I had to sadly set aside the crust thinking that it would fill me up too quickly, since I had to devour a half a pizza myself. But i ended up eating the crust at the end, since it was the best part of the pizza. The sauce wasn't too salty or sweet. The meatballs made it a tad tricky to eat the pizza by hand b/c they were so big! But who doesn't like big meaty balls. =D The red onions added a nice sweetness. I would have liked if it had a lot more basil... it only had a pinch. I honestly think the place is a tad overrated.. its not mind-blowing by anymeans, but pretty damn close to perfect pizza.",10/28/2011,24,93,0,c3RNVN5I8WNZ0fTdaNf76A

4710,Derek L.,0,5,"Very impressed with this restaurant! First of all, the restaurant itself is quite small, so you should definitely go during the random hours on a weekday. I got there on a Saturday around 3 and I waited for about 15 minutes. So I;m guessing the wait could be up to an hour during rush hours. The service was alright. Nothing special. Didn't have any glorious recommendations or anything. The food is delicious! We ordered a small pizza(fed 3 people with large appetites) with spinish and meatballs. I believe what makes this landmark so great is the cheese they use....Its not the crappy mozzarella you find at a deli, it the type with lots of fat to keep it nice and moist. The cheese doesn't harden as fast. Huge fan! We also got a caesar salad, nothing too impressive but pretty tasty overall. Check it out! Supposedly one of the oldest pizzerias in NYC.

We ordered the same pizza at both places: sausage, onions, and mushrooms. The crust is very tasty and thicker here (point to L as I prefer a slightly thicker crust), but I didn't like the sausage here as much. They use sliced link sausage where G's uses broken up bulk sausage with more seasoning in it. Still pretty good pizza and worth a visit.",10/15/2011,42,606,353,SHEziY_V4G60mVyLNvjLSQ

4722,Stephanie P.,0,4,"According to Yelp this was one of the best pizza restaurants in ny so naturally as a tourist I had to come. We ordered a large white pizza and a large (eh I forget the name) original (?)...the red 1st one listed. We came at 5:30 pm and waited 20 min. I can only imagine coming at peak dining hours. The food didn't take too long to come out. I personally preferred the white over the red. The mix of cheeses and and garlic on a pizza tastes like white sauce pasta but baked and with different textures. The original pizza was good except that maybe it's because I didn't have the red one right away but the cheese started to harden by the time I ate it so it wasn't as melted as I would've liked. But other than that it was good. It was good to have this experience once but to be honest if I lived in ny I wouldn't frequent this place because: it's a bit pricy, crowded, and rather noisy but the white pizza was good and it's a tourist destination so I think it's still worth going if you're from out of town.",12/30/2015,210,37,40,mpJSfVOYSfAzlaMpZuIIMw

4726,Scott Y.,0,3,"Lombardi's was unimpressive. Don't get me wrong. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't especially good, either.I should probably start with what I expected before going to Lombardi's: a ridiculous wait, rude service, and the best pizza I've ever tasted. Surprisingly, I was wrong on all three counts. I was seated immediately. My hostess and waitress were exceedingly pleasant, and my pizza was just about average.The best part was the sauce. If I ever end up back here, I will order my pizza with extra sauce, because the sauce was well above average, and there was nowhere near enough of it.The cheese was fresh mozzarella, which is definitely a difference maker on pizza; but these days any decent pizza place will at least offer the option of getting fresh mozzarella. So I can't really award too many points for this.The crust was really the downer of the whole experience. It was both bland and dry. It wasn't any better than what you would expect from any mediocre pizza joint with a brick oven, which really was enough to ruin the whole pizza.I should mention a few quick positives, though. The pizza wasn't at all greasy. Too often I find that New York pizza is swimming in a pool of standing grease. This pizza was not. Also, the staff was incredibly pleasant.As a side note, I have always heard how great New York pizza is, but have yet to experience anything that lives up to the hype. If you think that you know of a place that will, please let me know. Please don't recommend pizza by the slice places, however. I'm not in the habit of buying leftovers, and I sincerely believe that any cook / chef with any pride in his / her work would not serve leftovers.",5/25/2009,357,472,271,IB6su6qGVKcrWl7cOqrqbQ

4731,Lauren H.,0,4,"Since I was on business in NY and wanted to try ""the best pizza in the universe"" (according to Zagat), I tried Lombardi's.The wait for one on a Tuesday night wasn't bad--about fifteen minutes.  The waitress was quick to come over and take my order.  I like order cheese pizzas when I try a pizza for the first time because it really sets the standard and makes it easy to compare to other pizzas.  I was bummed out that they didn't do pizza by the slice, so I had to order a small cheese pizza for $15.  I also ordered their home-made unsweetened peach iced tea.I thought the waitress had forgotten about me--they brought me the pizza and not the drink.  I had to wave down my waitress for my drink.  The tea was excellent and thoroughly refreshing!The pizza looked fantastic!  It was thin with minimal toppings, but it had just enough.  The sweet marinara on the pizza was a bright red, and the mozzarella was the fresh kind.  There was shredded fresh basil on top.  The crust was chewy and slighly salty, but that's what made it so delicious.  It was a little on the expensive for the size and amount of toppings, but the taste made up for it.  I ate 2/3 of the pizza and took two pieces back to the hotel with me.This is certainly the best pizza I've had on the east coast, but I find the pizza better on the west coast (Frankie's Pizza in Redmond, WA and Pagliacci's all over the Seattle area).  The service here is so-so, but I'll be sure to come back the next time I'm in the area.",7/27/2008,58,95,30,IoW7biy5L49T3IBqmSRExQ

4736,Genevieve L.,0,4,"Maybe my friend and I were just very hungry after running only on coffee for 17 hours.  But I choose to believe that Lombardi's was just living up to its name and history.  We ordered a house salad and a small original.  While the size of the salad leaned towards the smaller end of the scale, it was fresh, and the vinaigrette dressing?  Spectacular!  Of course, the pizza, propped high on a metal pedestal, was the star of dinner.  Fortunately, the crust wasn't limp, and the pizza wasn't oily as they often are at other places in the city.  And while they only take cash, there's an ATM on premise.The table next to us, after reading the many raving articles on the wall, impressively recognized the owner as he was walking out the kitchen and struck up a quick conversation.  Really, people from all over come here to try Lombardi's.  The two men at the neighboring table are testament to this fact: both are visiting pilots, one from Arkansas and the other from San Francisco.  It was their second time in the city, and also their second time at Lombardi's.  The one from Arkansas had just started asking his wife a question on the phone, but when their pizza arrived, he decided that questions could wait and said bye, probably hanging up in the middle of his wife's farewell to lunge at his share. And if by some miracle you still have room for dessert after pizza, Rice to Riches is across the street.  And if pudding isn't your thing, walk around the corner for cheesecake at Eileen's.  (I do admit that there's a little bias going on.  A man, with an Italian accent, sitting near us suddenly said to me, ""You're very beautiful.  What is your name?""  And while this should have nothing to do with my impression of a restaurant, I AM only human, after all.)",4/13/2007,15,41,1,n1Olvtpz4_DMlel399e9yg

4739,Mario B.,0,4,"Lombardi's is an institution.  Every time I have visitors in from out of town, i take them here for a real Little Italy experience - The pizza is out of this world.  I recommend trying the meatball pizza, I recently had it for the first time, and I was very happy.  It is basically, their home made meatballs, on their signature margarita pizza - great crust, and very flavorful meatballs. .Treat yourself, and check it out - just factor in about 45 minutes for the wait if you go on a Friday or Saturday, there are no reservations.  If you go for lunch, it is usually easy to get in under 20 minutes. It is also cash only, if you didn't know.Peace. Mario B",5/25/2009,36,28,14,Dtap8eCiRj-qmbt_WljMLA

Wasn't crazy about having to sit in the cramped, uninspiringly decorated basement, but the pizza and beer were great. However, for the hype Lombardi's receives (whether they will it or no), I'd expect it to be five-star, knock-your-socks-off pizza; to me, it was merely four-star, good pizza.My socks are still on.

So I packed my SLR camera and couple of friends and headed to Lombardi's.Having grew up in the city, I avoided paying 20 bucks for a pizza for the longest time but today is the day!  It took a few nights to determine which one of those popular touristy pizzerias to hit and Lombardi is it.  It is, after all, the grandpapi of all the ""top"" pizzerias in the city so why not?For three people, we ordered a large pie with sweet sausage topping.  The pie looked good but the topping tasted blah and the crust was chewier than we had expected.So you ask, is the worth it at the end? Nope. Honestly, there is a pizzeria on every street corner here in the city for half the price and some are, in my opinion, better!

4744,Adam Z.,0,4,"Lombardi's is the pizza by which all other coal oven pizza* should be measured. Not only because of the deliciously crispy crust or the incredible decadence of the white pie (seriously excellent ,slightly charred ricotta), but because its the first and they still probably do the thin crust pizza the best. Also the staff at Lombardi's last night (Monday, May 18) was wonderful. We had a large party (10) of mostly inconsistent arrivers and the staff was very accommodating on a night that they probably could have (and should have) told us to bugger off. You should check out Lombardi's just for the very nice staff. Also, if you have a big group, do everyone a favor and arrive together. Another quick note. Some in the party mentioned that the sauce was sweet (which it is). Its not overly sweet (its actually quite delicious) but important to note depending on your sauce proclivities. * For my tastes, I separate out the thin crust coal oven pizza from NY style pizza, which usually has a slightly thicker crust and is eaten folded in half from a paper plate on the street or standing at a counter.

The mozarella was probably sliced straight from a ball. The basil just made it all the more delicious. We had no problem devouring our small margherita pizza. My only complaint: no refills on a $2 soda. I worked in the food industry. I know it costs less than a nickel for a refill. Why so cheap? I have to knock them down a star for this because I read it as they know they are so good they don't feel the need to offer something so simple to their customers and that is bad customer service.",6/24/2007,21,118,0,vg84i-cc3ZJwSCRC4bx47A

The other thing is to stay away from the flavorless sausage and that pretty much goes for any pizza place in NYC. Why does New York consider a rubbery paper thin piece of eraser to be sausage?

Had to wait a while to get our bill and change.Food: We ordered the breadsticks and marinara appetizer. Tasted like day old dry sourdough that I would have bough at the grocery store.

So, my friend and I ordered a small pizza which comes with 6 slices and whatever you want on top of it. We tried half oven-roasted red peppers with half meatball. MMMMMM, it was soooooo good. It came still steaming and smelling good from the oven. The pizza would have been delicious without the toppings, but the toppings made it so much more grand. There was slices of fresh mozzarella and lots of thick tomato sauce loaded on the thin crust. They have a wide selection of toppings including: spinach, sausage and others that I'm forgetting.

4776,Matt L.,0,5,"Absolutely amazing. This is clearly the best pizza I've ever had in the US and there are very few out there that could compete at a level of this pizzeria and of course it's all in New York and nowhere else. But, here are a few things that you should know before you find yourself rather disappointed because I found several people among the reviewers about their disappointing experience and here's why. - Lombardi's isn't like one of the fine dining restaurants that serve the pizza in a creative or interesting twist. They serve pizza in the traditional way with the choice of toppings well within the range of the ordinary. But, what's truly amazing it how this ordinary is done so perfectly. - If you are looking for Chicago style of pizza or a more doughy texture, you are looking at the wrong place. Lombardi's does their crust thin, chewy, with a slight burnt edge, the way it's done in Italy.- The price is slightly more expensive then other pizzerias of similar style and is almost on par with pizzas served at fine dining restaurants. But, this is America's first pizzeria. Consider this and factor it into your experience, and enjoy it as if you are entering into a historical place. And, you'll feel better. -Lastly, from my own perspective, if I were to list one downside to the Lombardi's, it has to do with the quantity of cheese on the pizza. Unless you get extra mozzarella, you will be hoping that you did because it comes with so little. And of course, extra cheese topping will boost the $$$. With few meat toppings and veggies, this will easily make the pizza a bit pricier. All in all, amazing experience. And for the first timers, it will be an unforgettable experience as it was for me even with the toughest standard of excellence with regards to pizza.",6/25/2012,90,138,225,AmMsxK4ooPok74Hb6UGQMg

I came here and was seated next to a cigarette machine. I believe the waiter said it was just for looks, but it was something I hadn't seen since the 80s and the machine totally had an old school back in the days feel with the pull handles.After being seated for a while I was given a menu. I looked at it and there were two sizes of pizzas. A 14"" or an 18"". We decided on the 14"" since we weren't that hungry. Of course, we went with the margarita pizza as that is the stand pizza we test out when it's available for ordering. Looking over the menu we notice on the bottom it says cash only. Great. After going around and around New York and New Jersey paying for everything from tolls to more tolls, it was like am I stuck in some sort of time warp? We placed the order any way.The pizza came and the crust was a bit thicker than I'm used to. Also the pizza had about four to five round cut slices of mozzarella on it. The fresh garlic was not finely chopped, but kind of sloppy cut and randomly placed. I put the usual amount of crushed peppers and ate. It had some flavor and the basil was the same as the garlic, randomly placed on the pizza. Keep in mind this is the pizza they have as their special. I got to the crust of the pizza and of course it's a bit thicker and a little salty, but not super salty.The pizza wasn't soggy and was kind of crunchy. The crust as I said was a bit thicker than I was used to. Thought New York pizza was supposed to be thin crust. Overall, I was a bit sad about the experience. It left me wanting back my Amici's pizza back in San Francisco. This place was suppose to be the first place and it was a bit of a let down.

4785,Lindsay H.,0,4,"New Yorkers can be pretty opinionated about their pizza as I'm sure they can be about lots of other things too, but I don't see how anyone can argue that Lombardi's is some darn good pie. This is a must-eat for every visit to New York. The interior is cozy and welcoming and unassuming for being perhaps the most acclaimed pizza I've ever eaten. My girls and I started with a house salad, which was actually quite good despite looking rather basic. Then of course we tore away at a large pie with meatballs and pepperoni. The crust is divine, the sauce is perfect, the cheese is straight from heaven, and the meatballs were amazeballs! Although the thin crust looks like it won't be filling, it was hard for the three of us to finish the large pie. (We did scarf down some chicken and rice like an hour before to quiet our post-drunk stomachs).

But go with an open heart and just try it!  I became an instant fan of this. OOOH, I'm still thinking about it three days later.The tossed house salad was also yummy with a very tasty, not oily dressing.I was told that there are usually a very long line but we went on a Tuesday night after 9pm so it was only about 15 min. wait so take notes folks!  Go late on a week night.Oh I also had a glass of chianti and it was good, good, good :DYou can't go wrong with this place so just GO.",6/26/2009,95,437,1828,_5gPub9T4APA0Bjyw2VC-w

By far, this pizza was muuuch better than Grimaldi's! The margherita had plenty of fresh, oozy mozzeralla and a nice tang to the sauce.

I was fortunate enough to come here once before, so on a recent trip, my husband, the pizza lover, wanted to go as well.We swung by for a pie during lunch and since it was his first time there, we went with the large 18 inch standard margherita pizza. Thanks to the fast cooking coal oven, the pizza arrived just a few minutes later, just as I remembered it, with the individual slices of mozzarella splashed haphazardly in the sauce and with just the right amount of basil sprinkled across the top.Upon removing a slice, there was no slippage of toppings and upon examining the pizza's beautiful crust's underside, you could both see and smell the markings from the coal oven.When you visit, don't forget that Lombardi's doesn't accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash.I'm absolutely convinced that pizza doesn't get any better than Lombardi's and my husband is now a converted fan as well!",11/22/2010,2,54,0,Zm41R3MIlWXc8iUfprMSMQ

We figured ""Hell, why not?"" and put in a reservation. A half hour later, we were lead down the stairs and seated at a table adjacent to the wine bottles neatly displayed on the shelves. Beautiful!! Wine and pizza. Now that's what I like!!So we wound up ordering a large pizza with 5 toppings on it. Onions, garlic spinach, mushrooms, some sausage, and another topping that I can't seem to remember off the top of my head, along with a raspberry Italian soda(topped with whip cream) for myself. And can I just say now.... my eyes nearly rolled back into my sockets. Ok fine, who am I kidding? They did roll back in their sockets and my heart started doing cartwheels in my chest. I was in love. Between the two of us, we had polished off about 3/4 of the pizza. It was that good.  I definitely recommend going here for a bite and if you're appetite still isn't satiated by the wonders of this Italian dream, then you can walk down the street and pick up some frozen yogurt at Pinkberry or some rice pudding at Rice to Riches.",4/3/2008,296,208,56,9E-yyWmwR0tj5YTb9frekQ
4837,Travis M.,0,4,"Today we finally got around to trying out the famous Lombardi's Pizzeria, commonly called America's First Pizzeria since 1905. It was a Saturday evening so unsurprisingly we found it packed, having to wait 35 minutes before even getting seats, yet thankfully pizza itself only took a measly 15 in comparison. So be wary, this isn't your typical get in, get out pizzeria. Lombardi's is more of a straight restaurant with lots of historical articles and memoirs collected over the charming brick walls, it's definitely an atmosphere that brings an aged smile to one's face (and hundreds of tourists taking millions of shots of another standing in front of every picture in the place making the already crammed interior worse). As expected from a thoroughly restaurant setting they do not sell slices, but the small 14"" 6 slice original pizza was just the ticket for two.As for sides, it was a pleasant surprise to order a pitcher of soda to avoid being ripped off on refills, I highly recommend this if you're a thirsty eater such as myself. On the other hand, the bread sticks were disappointingly plain, just bread cut into stick slices, no more...no less and considering their price they are completely passable. Though let's talk about the real deal shall we? The pizza was fantastically seasoned and every bite had a satisfying crunch. The mozzarella cheese was perfectly tender and smooth going down, but the real show stealer was the juicy sauce which bathed my mouth in its delight. Yet sadly, I found it a bit too thin for my tastes, the crust was certainly drier than I'd prefer, and pepperoni topping was minuscule to say the least.It's definitely one of the best Neapolitan slices in NYC, maybe not quite as uniquely flavored as the competing Grimaldi's, but a classic in its own right through and through. A perfect date for 2-4 as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait for seating, the expected inflated restaurant pricing, and very thin slice. Regardless, it's a classic pizza experience that everyone, even blinding snap happy tourists, should enjoy.",11/20/2011,3,6,0,NI3pQBCRI3kJrc04rHJP3A
4838,Annie C.,0,4,"Came here after the San Gennaro fair in Litte Italy with 4 people. We sat upstairs through the creepy stairs and ordered their cheese pizza, which comes out looking like a margherita pizza. I thought the pizza was really good (worth 4 stars alone), the cheese not too thick. The rest of my party agreed. We were pretty full after the 1 pie. The service was really slow though.

It's not!After all I've read and heard about it from reviews and people, I decided to eat here during my stay in NYC in early September 2009. The place was packed! Thank God the wait time was only 15 minutes or I would've dodged out of there. There's only 2 real choices: Gennaro's Original Pizza and Gennaro's White Pizza. We ordered the original, half with cheese & pepperoni and other half with cheese & tomatoes (because I don't eat meat). I have had SO MUCH better. The sauce was lacking flavor, there was barely any cheese, and the pizza overall wasn't baked well. I've tasted better pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. I thought I'd have better pizza in the real New York, but I guess not.Also, the fountain drinks are not bottomless, this is just absurd to me! I had to slowly drink my root beer so I didn't run out. There's also a Cash Only policy which is crazy! They'd make so much more money if they accepted debit and credit cards. The wait staff were not friendly, but not mean either. They just took our order and never really bothered to ask us for anything else. The pizza here is not at all special in my book. What a waste.",10/8/2009,4,43,0,eSRbeiu6Drx7I2Mfpb4iIg

So after waiting forever for my friends to come, we still had to wait another 10-15 minutes to be seated. This is thin cust pizza where all the fixings fall off and you need your hands to roll it all back up. I forget all the toppings we ordered, but was definitely satisfied with the outcome. We were all trying to figure out what made it taste so good -- was it the brick oven, was it our hunger or the fresh ingredients, or was it the dough. However, we decided it was the brick oven taste.  The caprese salad was ok -- will probably order the bruschetta next time for appetizer. Overall, I'm happy I came to Lomabardi's to try real New York pizza.  The service was good -- the waitress even suggested some party places we could go to afterward.",8/17/2009,25,43,1,z8ADg6z7r6ZFMyd-gMfHzw

4858,Alexei B.,0,4,"Lombardi's, despite its humble origins, has become an enterprise. The restaurant lazily sprawls out through several adjacent buildings and the waiters wander to and fro with headsets in their ears. In spite of this, the pizza you can get here is still some of the best in New York. Technically speaking, it's a marvel: perfectly cooked, perfectly cut, with perfect blobs of mozzarella lining the surface and served at a perfect temperature. The crust in particular is astonishingly good: crisp, toasty, and moderately chewy, with more than enough force to hold up the ingredients as you work your way through the pie. Flavor-wise, however, it's not my favorite. Specifically, the tomato sauce is just a bit sour for my tastes, and the cheese doesn't form that wonderful savory web across the surface like it does at John's, Joe's, and ilk. But I still think Lombardi's lives up to its name, and it's definitely worth a visit for that one-of-a-kind New York experience.",11/4/2013,29,109,1,V1IiWOeVx5oQzhMF7yxtQg

We couldnt even hear each other talk.Anyhoots, back to the pizza....it's damn good pizza...thin, hot, some burnt goodness....limited toppings..15ish...the white pizza wa good, but not great..the custom mushroom mozzerella tasted much better, though 2 of my friends liked the white better.Okie, for pizza, yes, this place rocks, but i keep comparing to a place i love so dearly in providence RI called bob n timmys! which is hidden right behind federal hill.Bob n timmys is Incredibly pizza, but their crust doesnt taste like pizza dough..its more like a thin fluffy pastery yet holds togerhter....their taste is sensational.So to compare my favorite place and lombardis, its hard to say, but Lombardis was great, but not the best I have had....perhaps the deafness in the space ruined my experience some....otherwise i might have to try out grimaldis now over in nyc...Go to Lombardis if you want to spend 14$ on a 14 inch pizza, or  18ish in a 17... topping cost 2-3$ each. Environment, loud!!!!! but managable if ya'll screem and are good at reading lips.There is await..i'll assume this place is so populare because of it's location...right in/below soho near popular places.",7/20/2007,31,148,32,F1rIfM1lVvpeaOxOe9D3ZQ

4882,Christian M.,0,4,"The World Famous Lombardi's Pizza aka the first pizzeria in the United States.  That's all you have to say about this place.  It's a legend.  I was doing my research two weeks ago in San Diego trying to figure out where to go as far as classic NY pizza.  I found some help from some friends that Lombardi's was the spot to go to.  It definitely did not disappoint!  After getting some shopping done at Supreme, I made a short walk to Lombardi's for some pies.I first walked in and was surprised that it was a sit down joint.  I was expecting a busy walk in and walk out type place.  We got seated and got the menu.  I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the margarita style pizza.  I figured sure let's do it.  I ordered a small size version and split it with my brother.  All I can say was WOW.  The pizza here is GREAT.  The crust has that certain chew to it that I love.  The pizza sauce that I stress is superb.  I must say that.  I really recommend trying this pizza.  It taste so great.  This trip was definitely worth trying.  If you look at the wall, you'll see that Rachel Ray recommended this as one of her favorite pizza spots!  Go here and get the true pizzeria experience!",12/15/2008,154,479,795,yU3Fjjta3OYMuK2YHQaGsA
4883,Gregory L.,0,4,"To be fair, this pizza is very good, but not the best in NY.  I first went to Lombardi's in Philly, when they had a location near Rittenhouse.  As a young man from New Hampshire, it was an awakening to have the coal oven pizza, thin crust, perfectly toasted toppings... and then they closed, I think their building was being demolished for a new skyscraper.  A few years passed and I went to the NYC Lombardi's - good, but not great and not as good as the Philly location, in my opinion.  The coal oven thing was taken a little too far, as the crust was black in a lot of places, which compromises the taste of the rest of the pizza.  A good place to go and develop your own opinions.",1/3/2009,17,94,0,ldnuIYms0jjlX9XEINVkaw
4884,Adam R.,0,5,"I'm working my way through the best pizza in New York and finally got to this landmark. While I may argue that it's not the best in New York, it's definitely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.I was supposed to eat someplace else in the neighborhood, but there was a 45 minute wait on a Friday night. We wandered around and found a 15 minute wait at Lombardi's. I was glad to make the switch.The place is neat looking, with that old school Italian feel. They lead us through a maze to get to our table, but the table was nice and cozy. The service was also very nice. I don't recall them doing anything special, but I had absolutely no complaints.We ordered a Caesar salad, 12 breadsticks, 1 large pie with ricotta and meatballs, plus four sodas. The total bill with tip and tax was around $60. That's very reasonable. There were no refills on the soda, which is my only complaint about the place.The Caesar Salad was delicious. It was light on the sauce and heavy on freshly shaved parmasan cheese. It was large enough to feed two people easily.The breadsticks were good. They came with a nice large cup of sauce for dipping. The breadsticks were very thick and filling. They tasted good, though not spectacular.The pizza itself was delicious. The meatball topping was made with half pork and half beef and was sliced thin. The sauce on the pizza was nice, though a little mild. They go a little lighter with the cheese, but it doesn't affect the taste and cuts down on the grease. The crust is delicious. I was eating my wife's crusts. Many claim it's the best in New York. I disagree, but it is definitely good pizza.Overall, it's a great place. The atmosphere is great. The service is good and the wait for a table is reasonable. The food is delicious. The price is good.",3/3/2009,209,112,173,orslvo8FZrMOJEDmBKOwrA

I haven't been in about 2 years, but I was just looking for a short term apartment rental in the village and delightfully realized I'll be oh so close to my favorite eatery... Especially being from Cali, nothing compares. The crust is perfection, the cheese is melted to a gooey-ness that can't be duplicated... Every time we go to NY which will be very often now (YAY)...

I can be honest and tell you that this place is worth the hype. Putting a lot of time and effort on making amazing pizza pie is great. Add to the fact that it's inexpensive as well and you can have a great time with friends. The only knock on this place is that it is quite small so make reservations before coming here otherwise your in for a wait.Of course not knowing what to get since I'm a rookie in terms of NY pizza my friend and I ordered a large with pepperoni and sausage and boy was it tasty. the right amount of meat, sauce, and cheese (real cheese) made my experience great. The bread was not doughy what so ever and it had a nice refreshing crisp to it. The meats were not at all greasy which made things even better.If your ever in Little Italy for vacation or any other reason be sure to drop by this place for an authentic thin crust pizza.",6/14/2009,580,124,0,xbSjBSDhl1asvg4g0-9SXQ

Now on to the food me and my brother spent well over $100 bucks its pricey but worth every penny, we ordered a Margarita pizza pie, and a white cheese pizza pie, two calzones, and couldn't even finish it all, the slices are so delicious the pizza crust is thin and crispy, their sauce has just the right flavor not too strong and not too weak a nice Oregano and garlic flavor, the cheese is the real deal and the calzones forget about it to die for, we left stuffed and had pizza to spare we ate the rest on 14st Union Sq sitting down on the big elephant statue that's there stuffed as clams we were, but we had such a wonderful day. I recommend you take a friend to enjoy the experience with you or your family its a great atmosphere for kids and the whole family to go out and enjoy it, or just go it alone you're still going to enjoy yourself.

While hanging out at D.B.A.'s Sunday watching the game, my friends and I decided we needed a little pizza to go with our beer. No, we didn't get Lombardi's, we got Lil' Frankies, they are two blocks away. The Lil' Frankie's pie was classic Lil' Frankies - nice, burned bottom crust, light, with lots of air pockets, and tending towards the crispy side, rather than the chewy. Easy on the salt, easy on the spices, letting the quality of the ingredients shine through.Pretty much exactly how I like it. Lil' Frankie's makes a great pie. But this is not a review of Lil' Frankie's. This is a review of Lombardi's. About an hour after we scarfed our diminutive LF pie, some fine, upstanding gentleman at the bar ordered about five pies from Lombardi's for the whole bar!  You can imagine our glee, we loaded up with a couple of pepperoni and a couple cheese slices, and bought the guy a drink. The Lombardi's pie was on the other end of the pizza spectrum from Lil' Frankie's.Still very good. However, it was quite salty, spicy, with both the sauce and the crust bursting with a considerable amount of flavor. The crust was more uniformly chewy, with a crispy, but not burned bottom and top, and no discernible air pockets.  Honestly, I found it somewhat overpowering. And I like the burned bits. I think for some people, Lombardi's may be the perfect pie. But for me, it's still Patsy's on 117th.",1/22/2008,9,50,7,wU3IsWm95pjjq34TodjZSw

Let's just say I get cranky if I'm hungry and made to wait.  It's not that the place is small, it's just super-busy.   If you're able to snag one of the few seats in their bar area, I might just bump them back up, but that's not a very likely possibility, unless (once again) you make it in before the dinner rush.

We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday around 1:30 and it was about 3/4 full. The maze of rooms in this place make it very awkward. The menu is very small, pizza or maybe pizza. I always like to order a salad with my pizza, I know, I know, it's the California girl in me but let me give you a bit of advice, skip it here. We ordered the mixed greens and it was like ""would you like some lettuce with your dressing?"" The salad was swimming in dressing, maybe to cover up the old brown leaves. I ordered a glass of Montepulciano, again skip it. They have like 3 different wines by the glass, I tried 2, the Chianti as well and not only did they both taste the same awfulness but they serve them in mini glasses as well. I think maybe I'm expecting a bit too much from this joint but if the pizza had blown my socks off I might have forgiven the rest. We ordered a small margherita and for like $17 I kinda felt a little violated. The crust is good but the cheese and sauce are just mediocre. I really felt like I had walked into one of the many bad tourist traps in Little Italy and maybe this is, just a few blocks removed. With all the Pizza places in this city, feel free to skip this one.",1/11/2013,82,447,2,KHZsBBgcMCnXPI2w_bMp2A

There are multiple pizza places in the city that are awesome, but I'm super glad we picked this one to take our guests from out of town.",9/3/2011,23,52,6,Ve7H42QAbFY-dAvy481ufg

Not for nothing, I'm realizing they're alot of Yelpers who don't know Jack Shit when it comes to food!! This is the Holy Grail of Pizza.....REAL PIZZA. Pizza has many variations and alot are good. When it comes to the brass however this is how it's done. Coal oven, check. Perfect crust, check! Fresh Buffalo mozzarella, check, san marzano tomatos, CHECK. Now, you may look at a pie like this and think, Wow, there really is'nt alot of cheese on this pizza. Yo, why do you think New Yorkers fold Pizza. It started for this reason. You fold the pizza to make the hot mass of gooey goodness fall to the bottom of the fold, the sauce follows and the basil rests atop. So there you go stoopid. Lombardis is more bad-ass than a Honey Badger!  This time around I had the Clam Pie too. The Clam Pie is incredible...Im still drooling. 2 dozen fresh shucked clams atop Lombardis crust with garlic, Garlic infused olive oil, fresh orgeano and basil. Heaven! CASH ONLY! The right way.

4935,Matt J.,0,3,"I know this is the first pizza place in NY and I have mad respect for such a thing, but first does not mean best. This place did not come near the best in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, this pizza is good pizza. Eating it made me happy. There's a few main things that make a pizza great: the sauce, the cheese, and the crust are the obvious, the oven, the craftsmanship, and the love are the others. The oven is quality, the craftsmanship was sound, I wasn't feeling the love. The crust was good, the sauce didn't do much for me, and the cheese was above average. Where does that put this pizza? Well, it puts it somewhere between average and great.If you're downtown and feel like trying the first pizza place in NY and there is no line, then it's worth a visit.

Once we come to grips with the bastardization of pizza in this country, we need to separate the artisans from the TGIMcApplebees of the pizza world. Lombardi's for me is one of my favorites. I'll admit, there are certain pizza joints that I go to for specific pies. Lombardi's is one that I go to for their white pizza. If pizza is the perfect food, than white pizza for me has got to be top of the mountain.

My husband and I both thought the pizza was bland and overpriced. The bottom crust was soggy, the rest of the crust was burnt tasting. There was hardly any topping on it - considering they charge about $3 per topping, we expected it to be more substantial. We still felt hungry after finishing 3 slices each. The service was okay - not overly friendly, but not rude, though we did feel rushed. Maybe this is just a NY thing.I have to say the $3 slices we had from Patzeria Perfect Pizza in Times Square were a 1000% better.",12/2/2011,0,42,4,c_LGufdUDifUMQKEHNRb0Q

More than once I've picked up a slice only for it to immediately droop flaccidly, like a flower held by a sad clown, sending the sausage chunks toppling off like CGI commuters on a suspension bridge in a disaster movie. Other than that, it is very good pizza, sure, but I never quite understood why people rave about it like they're in an infomercial and the announcer just said ""Tired of this?"" and then they show other pizzas exploding, spilling everywhere, just barely beating out your kid for Valedictorian, etc. In the end, I enjoy Lombardi's pizza just as much as I enjoy all other above-average pizza--that is to say, a lot--no more, no less.",7/12/2010,81,207,1,4yu5oyhStREopr0ABE0zcQ

We waited a short amount of time for a table, which I'm sure they always have some sort of wait. The menu is very limited, but if you are going there, there is only one thing you have in mind anyway. Whenever I try pizza at a new place I have to get just cheese, because if you can't survive on just your cheese pizza then its not worth my time. The pizza was great. The crust was crispy, the san marzano tomato sauce was flavorful, and the cheese was melty and stringy. I think about this pizza all the time now, and can't wait til I'm in the city again. I would like to try some toppings next time. Also if you like cheese as much as me, I would recommend ordering extra cheese because there isn't as much as I am used to. Their salad and italian dressing are also tasty and big enough for 2 or 3 people at least.

The eatery is roomy by NY standards, and was borderline tacky with the checkered tablecloths and decor. Set on comparing it to Grimaldi's, we ordered a regular with pepperoni and a white with sausage. Came for a VERY late dinner, 10 PM, so there was no wait. For the regular style pizza, I prefer Grimaldi's, which has a nice buttery crust and fresh tomato sauce taste. As for the white pizza, I wish I could combine the two. I like Grimaldi's crust and strong garlic flavor, but I am a huge fan of the rounds of ricotta on top of Lombardi's. Some of my friends thought it was too rich but I loved it. The cheese on both pizzas also didn't get as rubbery as they cooled down on the Lombardi's pizza. Overall, I'd have to hand it to Grimaldi's.",10/31/2011,33,145,0,IlyfABIKsHyWpgHx11n_1g

5004,Katie W.,0,5,"I've been traveling to New York once a year and the first time I ventured out on my own, I was determined to try some authentic NYC pizza. I did my research and decided on Lombardis. It was walking distance from where I'd be and it's Americas first Pizzaria. Can't argue with that. I went in by myself and ordered the tomato and mozzarella with basil. Let me just say, it was everything I was hoping it would be. The crust was thin and super crispy. It had that slight oven char on the bottom, which I love. The cheese was delicious. Nice and stretchy. The tomatos were so fresh and they were still juicy even though they were just cooked in a very hot oven. The basil added that perfect bright herby flavor and complemented everything wonderfuly. The best thing about their pizza is their sauce. The tomato sauce was absolutley perfect. It was savory and acidic. Thats the way tomato sauce should always be. Some places like to put too much sugar in their tomato sauce and I hate that. Lombardis makes their sauce EXACTLY how I like it. The great thing about this place is that you really can taste the freshness of all their ingredients. It's like they get fresh batches of everything every day. I wouldn't be surprised if they do, I mean it's New York. Another great thing about their pizza is their super crispy crust. It provides a real variation of texture with the other soft ingredients. Lombardis Pizza is the best pizza I have had so far, but I'm always on the look out for something better. Oh, and if you come to visit Lombardis, don't forget cash, as it is a CASH ONLY establishment. They do have an ATM inside, but you'll be charged that annoying fee.",12/18/2012,47,137,71,ejryf32C4ZBURQojvWsxig

The sauce has a great flavor and the crust has a great texture.

And are you really charging me for 2 cokes when you didnt even bring the second coke until when I was finished with my meal ?  I was speachless really.  If you charge that much for a pizza the service should be outstanding which is not the case.Ill remember this place hopefully, and wont visit again.p.s. despite the coke issue here the pizza just isnt worth it.And then once and again they dont accept credit cards.",12/15/2011,0,7,0,7IzBspinhsMZ3ivH8ssF7w

The spinach was particularly good; I loved how garlicky it was. We also got breadsticks and sauce, but I regretted it because who wants boring breadsticks with not nearly enough sauce taking up space in their stomach when the pizza is this awesomely yummy? Not me. I wouldn't get them again, nor the Italian soda (strawberry syrup, seltzer and whipped cream with a cherry on top), which just wasn't my thing, although it was fun to try.Now, as for the the heated debate on best old school slice, I've yet to try Totonno's and DiFara's, but I can compare it to Grimaldi's. I would say the pizza here is a slight step down from what you get in Brooklyn, but Lombardi's wins on just about every other count. You can leave your name instead of having to wait in a strict line, and there are actually benches to sit and wait on, as well as the bar. More importantly, the servers are actually NICE. Imagine that! I actually saw someone join his friends midway through their meal and the waiter pulled up a chair for him, rather than yelling and physically barring his entrance to the restaurant. Also, its clean and bright and cheery inside, while Grimaldi's smells like a foot. I'd happily eat the pizza from either establishment, but I'd feel much better about patronizing Lombardi's, which lacks Grimaldi's ""fuck you"" sense of entitlement.

5038,Joe B.,0,5,"Wow, what else can I say that hasn't been said about Lombardi's? Best pizza anywhere outside Italy. Since this place has been thoroughly dissected in other reviews, let me just focus on the meatballs. Love, love, love the meatballs.

They said it would take 15 mins & it was ready when I showed up.The original pizza was ok, I was expecting more for all the hype associated with this place. Everyone in my group said the same thing. The pizza is eh. I'm glad we didn't wait a long time to eat here. Next time I'm in NYC I will look for another pizza joint to try out.

5044,Josh G.,0,4,"If it were possible, I would give Lombardi's 3.5 stars.  But it's not possible so I will give it 4, based on its iconic status, reasonable prices, efficient service, ambience, etc.  It's a very solid and good pizza, of the New York coal oven variety. In fact, for this style of pizza, it's certainly among the very best (although, to be fair, there aren't many places that are in the NY coal oven category).  I'm not a huge fan of the white pizza, which has fluffly clouds of whipped ricotta cheese.  The standard pie is quite enjoyable, though, which red onions and sausage.  It is quite enjoyable to go there on a summer evening, stand outside waiting for what could be quite a while, and then perhaps strolling around SOHO or the East Village afterward.",6/11/2010,21,43,0,4gsB-lK9RCBGdMYGl_JbtQ

And I am all about service, and the service wasn't that great. Though we didn't have to wait, we sat upstairs in an almost empty extra room, to only be moved for a ""party of 17"" that never came.

I just wish that the waiting time was worth it for their pizza. 45 minutes in the freezing cold with toes starting to numb seemed a little too much for just ok pizza. I know it's somewhat of ""a place to go for pizza"", but seriously if I had known how their pizza was I would have gone to Patsy's for pizza. But if you would like to run the risk of potential hypothermia, please order their original pizza and add a topping just to make it interesting. Go for the white pizza if you go crazy for an endless amount of cheese. If you skip it, you are not missing much.

We got a pitcher of sangria and small original pizza, one half with sautéed garlic spinach and the other half with mushrooms. The sangria was not bad but the pizza came out really soggy and the crust could barely hold the pizza up. I think it was because the tomato sauce was too watery.

5059,Peter A.,0,3,"I am a New York pizza fanatic.  I think this is a solidly 3-star ""good' pizza place, no better.  It is not in the same league as San Matteo, Di Fara, or Paulie Gee's, my current triumverate.The crust had a great texture and good flavor.  The sauce was pretty straightforward, not bad, but nothing special.  The cheese was fresh mozzarella (not very salted) and nothing else, which can actually wind up being a bit bland, and did here.  The cheese was also a bit overcooked by the oven--wonder if it was hot enough.  We also had mushrooms that were pretty bland.  A little basil and fresh oregano brightened the pie.Anyway, it was all fine, but just not as flavorful or as balanced as many other great pies I've had in the city.  I could imagine going here if I were nearby, though I think I'd probably just take the train a stop to John's or maybe even No. 28 near West 4th.Of course it's somewhat expensive, but did you really expect otherwise from a famous, touristy Soho pizza place?  I don't really care about the cost, though, since $20 or $30 isn't unusual for a pie this size at an upscale pizza place.  It was more than enough for two people, or precisely enough for two quite hungry people.  Can't hold $20.50 against them.",10/30/2011,1,9,0,vVQkkpzf3jzIP-MJ7AGxwQ

However, very good. Very very good pizza. We had both a sausage and a pepperoni.  You can tell that the ingredients are top quality and the oven isn't some industrial garbage. They really put some quality baking into their pizzas. Crispy, but not too thin on the crust. Certainly some of the best pizza I've had. Will I say that it's some kind of all-time great?

Where can you get a clam pizza pie, huh?  A pie that's made with over two dozen freshly shucked cherrystones and you eat it with... yes - lemon!  I must be new to this because I have not had clam pizza before and the experience was exhilarating.  Couple that pie with a Brooklyn on tap and you got yourself a weekend!  I wasn't exactly expecting gourmet - why? I think the red & white plastic table cloth gave that away but if the chef decides to kick this pie up a notch, then I would suggest him to remove the scallop like muscles in the clams that hold the shells. Leaving this part of the clam in any dish will make the clam too chewy to swallow naturally.  But it's okay becaue I wasn't expecting gourmet.  The house salad was good because I like onions.

5087,Joseph L.,0,4,"I came to Lombardi's last December on a trip to New York with my girlfriend. We had researched places to eat before coming, being the foodies we are, but I knew before even then, that it would be of complete necessity to eat here. I have known for years that this was the first pizza place in the United States, with pretty good pies as well. I was more excited for the novelty and opportunity to eat at such an establishment, one that put in motion something they never could have envisioned. At any rate, all we wanted to order was their original pie. I was surprised what the inside looked like. I was thinking it would be smaller, less restaurant-like, with a more hole-in-the-wall feel. This definitely detracted from my experience, seeing how commercialized and touristy it was. I will not fail to admit that I am part of the problem I suppose; I was a tourist in the city, wanting to go eat there, and with how many pizza places there are, I am sure a majority of their customers are tourists and visitors to the city. As for the pizza though, it was fantastic. Truly worthy of five stars aside from any other factors about the place. The crust was not too thin, thick enough to taste and support its adornments. The sauce was equally splendid, again one of the most important elements of a pizza. It had a slight spice to it, was not too sweet as can happen with homemade sauces, and served as a perfect fluid vessel for the fresh (very obviously so as I myself make fresh mozzarella) mozzarella and basil. Such a simple pie. Simple as all Italian cooking is. This pizza was quintessentially Italian in the sense of that simplicity and how pure, quality, familiar ingredients spoke volumes for themselves. I will go as far to say it was one of the better pizzas I have ever had, if not the best, I certainly tried no better pizza in New York while I was there. Regardless of whether the years of anticipation and my being in such a spectacular city for the first time played a part in my appreciation of this pie, it was as near perfection as a pizza could really ever get. It is a must try for both its historical value, and the comforting quality of the food, I still am thrilled that I had the fabulous opportunity of trying America's first pizza.",6/4/2013,51,100,1,fLs6kjU7XKSIjzMKYTjO3A

I read some of the negative reviews and some were obvioisly written by tourists or transplants. Yes, you may have to wait a while for a table, its the most famous pizza in nyc. Yes, the staff may hurry you out after you finshed your last slice, the line is out the door, down the block and across the street full of people waiting to take your table when you are done. And lets get real, the price was roughly $22 for a large pie and somePeople are complaining, as if the $28 for average pizza from any dive place is a  bargin. Is lombardi's the best pizza on the planet... I would say ""no"" only because i havent eaten at every pizzeria on the planet to compare. Is it the best in ny, i would have to say top 5 atleast. I also think that its scientifically impossible to make a thin crust pizza and at some point through eating, have part of it get a little soggy, especially towards the center of the pie. If yours is getting completely soggy, then you are not eating fast enough and causing a line to form outside the place. To recap: lombardi's is amazing and somePeople consider sex with a toothless crackhead from the point exactly the same as sex with adriana lima.",9/20/2011,0,16,0,gKL1K1yfwAJ5FZGhvh-Hzw

The restaurant is much larger than it appears on the outside and appears to be keeping up to date with renovations, etc. The pizza was excellent, but the breadsticks were terrible! They were completely bland and unimpressive in every way. Basically, like gnawing on bland bread.

Lets start with the crust- nice and toothsome- a little snap of crispiness on the outside , soft and chewy on the inside. The sauce, pretty basic but I am guessing its the quality of the ingredients  that lend loads of flavor. Ditto the cheese-its just different somehow, more flavor.

My major complaint with Patsy's, another (very good) famous pizzeria that is closer to my apartment, is that sometimes their pizzas are too light on the cheese. At Lombardi's, this wasn't a problem - the cheese was in exactly the right proportion to the crust and the sauce. Usually I don't order toppings on my pizza, but the mushrooms and red peppers were very good and definitely something I'd consider ordering again.Also, although there was a big crowd outside, I was impressed with how quickly they kept the line moving. We only had to wait for 15 minutes or so!

Pizza was good but pretty pricey. $3 for any topping that you want other than cheese. Also, drinks such as soda, iced tea, etc. are $3 in a tiny glass and NO REFILLS. This place sure knows how to run up your bill quickly. Our pizza came out fast but I think we were already turned off by the unfriendly, slow service and the nickle & diming. CASH ONLY too.

5170,B S.,0,1,"Awful and major consistency issues. Ordered the Margherita pizza and it came out in 5 minutes - first red flag. It looked absolutely awful - strike two. The crust was very much burned although I'm not quite sure how you can burn a pizza that came out in 5 minutes.The sauce was decent but very acidic so I'm pretty sure they add lemon juice to it which is definitely cheating and not authentic.  For the price of their pizzas, they should be using purely tomatoes. The only reason we finished it is because we were famished and had to be somewhere afterwards. After we finished, we looked over at our neighbor's pizza that just arrived and it looked absolutely gorgeous. Everything on it looked fresh and the pizza looked very well made. This restaurant is a disgrace to the food industry because I cannot for the life of my understand how you can be okay with serving two pizzas on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. I'm almost certain that we were given a pizza that someone sent back especially when I looked around at the other pizzas as we were leaving. If you can't be consistent, why would I bother coming back? I don't like playing russian roulette with my food, sorry. I won't be returning and will be telling my friends that come to town to stay away from this place.

My small pizza, which is plenty for two had a nice consistency when it came to the crust, but the taste was pretty bland and somewhat burnt. There were maybe 10 tiny pepperoni's on my pizza and that was it. The mozarella slices on top where pretty spectacular, but again I could have used more of them. It was also bordering on having too much red sauce. Also, in this day and age who doesn't offer free refills on soda? Lombardi's doesn't and it is a bummer when at $3 a pop for toppings your small pizza can very quickly become $25-$30. Bring cash, by the way.

Bring cash, cause like back in 1905, they don't take credit cards.  I didn't like how the mozzarella cheese was in chunks, so when you bite one side of the slice, you get no cheese.  However, I was told, that is how fresh mozzarella is done, but I rather have it melted evenly across the pie.  Overall, its a good NY style pizza, but I like my $10 large loaded Papa Johns anytime.",1/5/2011,40,58,14,h9dcR0NkxY5Wdc5FA2smiA

Everything about the pizza (toppings, tomato sauce, crust, cheese) were all just above average. The only saving grace is the historical value of the place.My suggestion if you want great New York style pizza, go somewhere else.

However, I noticed other people eating around us did not have this problem, so I suppose it was one of those typical, once-in-a-while mistakes. Other than that, the pizza was awesome. So awesome, in fact, my friend ate four slices and I ate three and a half.

I'm usually not a fan of too many toppings but mMmMmm anything would taste good on top of that thin, crunchy dough.

My review for this place mainly reflects my appreciation for how SO SO SWEET the staff was to let us wait inside for the place to open. They ended up seating us at 11:20.. another THUMBS UP!!  Super friendly service and really tasty pizza. It's in a very practical location, in proximity to tons of retail shops and other diners/restaurants. Really great closure to our NYC trip!!!!",3/7/2011,7,30,0,TN0mCdX5LBNY4Z65rfic3Q
5225,Rory Y.,0,5,I thought I had eaten the best pizza ever when I was in Chicago but that all changed when I ate pizza here. Lombardi's has the best pizza that I have ever eaten. It was a 45 minute wait in the rain but it was well worth it. We had a large pepperoni mushroom and we finished it all. It had fresh toppings with real Italian pepperoni and mozzarella. I'm back at home and i'm still thinking about it. Eating pizza for me will never be the same.  While we were there we found out that this was the first pizzeria in america.,6/27/2011,12,17,0,4JR2KWvRsUxjblt1j6L92w
5226,Darin E.,0,4,"I'm torn about this place.  Having had good pizza but a horrible dining experience at Grimaldi's Pizzeria, I really wanted Lombardi's to be a clear stand out in every way.  While it definitely produced a quality pie, it's not the best I've had.  (That honor goes to SF's Una Pizza Napoletana.)  But they won me over with awesome meat toppings which my favorite place does not (or on rare occasions does) have so I ended up loving it.  Also, I think it's important to mention how effective the hostess was as well as the table service.  As for the pizza, it has a good balanced flavor without the heavy salty taste of Grimaldi's.  The toppings tasted fresh and the crust had a nice slight char from the oven.  My one gripe about this place is the ambiance.  Or lack of it.  If you're seated downstairs (like me) or in one of the side rooms, you will notice that the decor just sucks.  I usually don't mind environment when the food is stellar but this place could really use some paint and or a redesign.",1/4/2012,294,339,16,SRz0Q-tsPd1SU8bvFi_ToA

Non chalant waitresses who will not mind ignoring you for 2 hours because after all they are 'Lombaridis' and they dont care if you come back or not5.

5232,Blayze O.,0,2,"Okay, so it's got history and there's apparently an oven in the back that says this place dates back to 1901. That's all well and good, and perhaps this is the sole reason to even go to to Soho (unless you're a touristy soccer mom or prepubescent girl) but aside from that, there's nothing elevating this place to legendary landmark status. It's the Applebee's of pizza restaurants, and the interior feels exactly like that. Instead of kitschy Americana junk littering the walls though, you get more of the typical red-sauce Olive Garden decor. It's really just a giant T.G.I. Friday's at the core though with typical 20-something kids running the joint. You're really just a number, not a valued customer here. Somehow, the quaint history of this place got lost in the process of making it accessible to tourists and thus exceedingly profitable for the folks who own this place.My experience though with this giant of the New York pizza world was actually not too bad. We were seated fairly quickly in the lower part of the restaurant, the table next to us was occupied by a handful of old-school Brooklyn-esque Italians chitchatting, shooting the breeze. If only they had those guys permanently on display there then this place would score a few more points on atmosphere.The pizza however, (the standard Gennaro pie which is your basic mozzarella, sauce, and basil pie) leaves much to be desired. Sure, it's a pretty respectable pizza compared to the garbage those fools out in Chicago consider pizza, but this is New York. Obviously you can do better. Yes, it's a good thin crust but that's really about the only thing going for it. (Head to any half-decent Brooklyn pizzeria for the same product but better) There's no handcrafted love to these pies and it shows, you're getting a quickly made pizza that while good, is far from anything great.I suggest that you visit Lombardi's once, as it is perhaps the last decent remnant of good Manhattan pizza with a bit of history to it. The only reason I entertained the idea of coming here was because Lucali's Pizza in Brooklyn was closed. Aside from that, there's no reason to ever return to Lombardi's unless you somehow really find their pizza to be something really delicious, which I don't.",5/5/2009,2,21,11,pIqq3DidAc7rH9YvAYDOsg

There's something about Lombardi's on a Saturday night.Maybe it's large pool of freakin' tourists outside clogging up the works.Maybe it's the one hour and twenty minute wait (really only thirty or so) they tell you you'll have to endure in order to consume the pizza.It still blows my mind how you can tell that almost none of the people there are actually from NYC.  Hint number one: not one of them is wearing even a little black. Other hints: 1. Bad hair colorists. 2. Bad hair styles. 3. Bad hair days. 4. Good hair days, but bad hair. 5. Large super-stretched Hummer limos dropping them off.5a. Men with bad jeans that come above their navels, with their hands in their pockets, standing around looking uncomfortable.6. Large super-stretched Lincoln Towncar limos picking them up.6a. All of the above, plus:7. They're actually sitting outside the restaurant reading the menu, deciding what pizza to get...8. ...for HOURS (especially when there's a perfectly good bar across the street where they could be drinking lychee martinis while they wait, like we did).9. Also, saying things like, ""Do you want pizza?  That Caesar salad actually sounds good.""9a. Men with bad uni-brows.10. Frat boys with the hipness quotient of a piece of cabbage. Really uncool cabbage. Cabbage from, for instance, Cleveland (by the way, did you know that people in Cleveland bring beer koozies out with them to bars? How freakin' lame is that? But I digress...)But on to the pizza, which is really the important part here, right?1. The crust is magnificent, chewy, just a little burnt and dense.  Moist in just the right way.  It absorbs the sauce. And speaking of sauce...2. The sauce is superb and there's actually enough of it. 3. The cheese is fresh and tasty mozzarella. Now, because this is fresh mozzarella, this pizza is not really the classic NY pizza slice pizza, but it predated it, so it's all good.4. Your pizza is cooked in a 102 year-old coal pizza oven. There's even a bad mosaic above the oven with the year 1905 spelled in the tiles.  How cool is that?5. It's the first pizza place in the U.S., the one to which ALL OTHER PIZZAS are in some measure beholden.  That pie from Pizza Hut that some douchebag in Nebraska is eating right now? Yep, he owes a debt of gratitude to Lombardi's. Sure, that's not really pizza, but it wouldn't be around if not for Lombardi's.Yes, it's a bit of a tourist trap.  A few years back they took over the store on the corner, so now there's more room to cram the B&T folks in on a Saturday.  Whatev.It's still a great pie at a great price.

I ventured to Lombardi's with my girlfriend this past Tuesday as she was raving about the Pizza.  To my surprise, I've been in NY for all of 19 years and my girlfriend whose been here a year, has eaten at this place before I have!  I am ashamed.  Still, better late than never, since the Pizza is worth the way (accordingly to reference).Tuesday, June 10th: - 6:00pm - Arrival @ Lombardi's - 6:05pm - Seating - 6:12pm - Pie of Choice - Large w/ Mushrooms, Sausage, and Pancetta - 6:21pm - Pizza Presentation, All Dieting Inhabitations Resolved - 6:47pm - Satiety Achieved, Although Desiring Another 6 Slices!So I arrived at Lombardi's at 6:00pm on a Tuesday evening to discover that there was no wait time to get into the restaurant.  Sweet!  I promptly asked for a table for 2 and was seated within the first few minutes of arrival.  Usually, the weekend wait can go anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours.  Luckily, mine was a mere 5 minutes.The ambiance of the restaurant is nothing to really rave about.  Afterall, we're @ a Pizza joint for Pizza.  Not at a James Beard Foundation nominated restaurant.  It's cheap eats!  Expect cheap seats.  I will comment though, the decor and theme of the restaurant played directly into their well established foundation in that their old school Pizzeria theme, decked with red & white checkered table clothes and unsteady wooden chairs, gives this restaurant a homey and relaxed feel.  Add to it the exposure brick wall, and you have yourself a traditional Pizza Parlor, minus the expensive prices experienced at some other places around NY.The Pizza...  Alright, if I knew that the Pizza at Lombardi's was THIS MUCH BETTER than the infamous Grimaldi's, I would've saved myself the 2 1/2 wait in line and came to this place on a weekday where the wait time is all of 4 minutes!!!  Not to mention that the Pizza was about 100 times better than it's Brooklyn counterpart.  Upon receipt of the Pizza, the aromatics released through the combination of the Basil, Fresh Mozzarella, Toppings, and Mildly Charred Crust infused to form a calm and warming sensation for it's future consumers.  I gathered my first slice, folded it promptly, and took a bite.  Alright, I burned by tongue!  But, I was able to conclude the following about the pizza....  The first detection that was evident through primary consumption is that of the tantalizing tomato sauce.  The sauce used in the application of that of a rip tomato base that's mildly seasoned with Salt, Pepper & Basil to give the necessary kick the pizza requires.  The secondary tastes that stems from the Pie is the lightly charred crust.  Measure approximately 1/2 cm in height, the petite application of dough used in this creation allowed for a balance between the various ingredients used in its creation.  The mildly charred crust produced a smoky, yet clean flavor that pair perfectly with rubbery texture of the fresh mozzarella.  All of this was aided by the additional toppings of Pancetta, Sweet Sausage, and Fresh Mushrooms.  The toppings provided the right amount of saltiness and different textural structures that made this pie truly unique.Needless to say, I consumed 6 slices!  Yet, I felt as though I needed another 6.  It was just THAT good!!!I have found my renewed love of Pizza!!!  I will never eat second or third tier pizza again!The total for the Pizza came out to approximately $25.50.  Not bad at all for Pizza that's second to few and far between!When going to Lombardi's, make sure you go on a weekday, immediately after work to avoid the insane crowds.  That way, you'll get to experience the Pizza and the environment of the restaurant without the 2 hour wait or being rushed out to accommodate the next group of people that want your seat.One warning for those attending, CASH ONLY!  Don't even think about dropping plastic on the table unless it's a Babe Ruth Rookie Card that's behind a solid plastic protective case.",6/12/2008,266,454,791,mQr4popcpi9E_hIIJ8Wumg

Now I know why, This place is tourist spot. (And all the reviews from people who live outside of NY proves it) It's overhyped, overpriced pizza that is known as the FIRST BRICK OVEN PIZZERIA IN MANHATTAN. The toppings are sparse and the sauce is super sweet. And for 20 bucks a pie I expected it to be larger. Im sure this place pays a pretty penny to be in the Zagat guide.

5252,Eric L.,0,4,"This place is supposed to be really famous in NY for pizza, so naturally we had to stop by. For a party of 4 we ordered two pies with split halves - for the first pie, we had sausage and mushroom for the first half and pepperoni and pineapple for the second half. For the second pie, we had margherita for the first half and then margherita topped with prosciutto. The pizza themselves were pretty good. The toppings were fresh, and the way the cheese melted into my mouth with every bite with the toppings worked really well in terms of the taste. The crust didn't really work for me, however. I really like a flaky and delicious crust, and this one seemed lackluster in my opinion. It's definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't break my back to come back here again. But that's just me. The final verdict? If you consider yourself a pizza connoisseur, come and give it a shot.

It looked like they were giving away free money or something. My friend had to fight her way through the crowd to even pick up a to go order!We ordered a large with meat balls and mozzarella. A pretty plain pizza but I will say, hands down the BEST EFFING pizza I have ever had in my LIFE!!! The fresh mozzarella is really what made the pie.

The energy in the place on weekday nights is great.....less tourists and more casual night out locals.  VERY VERY KID FRIENDLY.Checkered tableclothes,  original floors and walls...old-school bar and seating...you can simply smell NYC in this age old tradition.And many ppl argue that the PIZZA isnt THE BEST in NYC....but hey...the overall package and experience of PIZZA IN NYC  just can't be topped....and its not in Brooklyn...IN THE CITY---good job LOMBARDIS.",4/14/2008,35,62,8,ikmgxRQKYXS1h6lgi13PWA

This was my first trip to NY and as my first cherished NY meal, I saved that special moment for you... and you play me like this!?My boyfriend and I had their famous MARGHERITA pizza. Needless to say, I was utterly disappointed. My pizza was burned and looked like it was hastily made. The older couple next to us had a beautiful Margherita pizza. Tons of basil, well-balanced mozzarella, and a decent crust. Ours had maybe 3 pieces of basil? To be fair, the ingredients were fresh and the mozzarella had a lot of flavor but even the parts that weren't burned were merely satisfactory. We weren't able to even finish the pizza due to the burnt flavor overpowering everything that COULD HAVE BEEN. The crust was also a little too dense for my liking. Pizza crust is actually my favorite part of the pizza and for me to need water to wash it down is pretty sad.The couple next to us didn't seem to enjoy their pizza either. I overheard them saying, ""So this is the pizza they're known for? What's so great about it?""At $14 for a small pizza that is barely above ""decent"", it is definitely not worth it for me. Bleecker's is $3 for a perfectly cooked slice of Nonna Maria or Pepperoni Pizza. Artichoke's is a $3-4 for an amazing artichoke and crab slice.

We're all in sweaters and layers and jeans and boots. So then you come in and it's 89 degrees inside. Okay, other than that... service was a tad bit slow, but not unbearable. I also enjoy that your choice of soda is RC cola or Diet RC cola. Fortunately, they have iced tea, otherwise what a pickle I'd have been in. The pizza was very good. Not great, but that's a personal preference. Their sauce is too sweet for my liking. I like things a bit more zesty. Like Sbarro. Now THAT's a great pizza. (I am kidding. It was a joke. Relax, New York.) The crust was particularly delicious. Could taste the garlic baked in, and the little pieces that were slightly charred in the coal oven made it all worthwhile. I do think I'd try another NYC establishment before heading back to Lombardi's again, but that's not an insult. I'm just adventurous.",2/18/2008,987,239,34,jh_rji4QuVSN_hO1pa9D0g

For Instance, Chicago style Deep dish, California style wood fired, and of course traditional style thin crust. One thing that dose make a pizza stand out from another is fresh ingredients! I recently ate Amazing pizza in Rome, Florence & Venice & can safely say that it was the best pizza I have ever eaten! Thin slightly crispy crust with just a bit of homemade sauce, Fresh mozzarella & just enough toppings for added flavor. Truly the way pizza was intended. the perfect combination! Well that was the best pizza I had ever eaten until I had the Glorious Gastronomical experience that is ( Lombardi's)!! They make pizza the way it should be made in my opinion. Just like the pizza in Italy, Not to much sauce to over power the flavor & consistency of the crust. Just enough toppings & Incredibly fresh Mozzarella! The flavor profile of fresh mozzarella vs not fresh is so obvious & so different. Almost all pizza places use mozzarella that is not very fresh! It's hard & usually in blocks & can be shredded. Fresh mozzarella is Moist, soft & creamy  and has a flavor that only fresh mozzarella has! This perfect combination makes for the most Flavorful, Textural experience possible! So if you can't make it to Italy any time soon... Do yourself a favor & go to Lombardi's in NYC & have the Best pizza experience of your life! As good as Any pizza in I Italy if not better! Simply...

Lombardi's, since it's new renovation, with phony retro isolated dining room, after isolated dining room is the New Yankee Stadium of pizza, more worth a walk-by than a meal - a nod to something that used to be great, dishing up replicas and facsimiles for $20 before you ever even talk toppings.  Don't complain when the thin crust immediately soggs to inedible mush and don't make the mistake of calling 2 minutes after their delivery cut off, because the bottom line at Lombardis is they just don't care.  Walk a block down Mott street and hit up Lasso.  It actually has an atmosphere and Pizza worth a recommendation.  I'm not shilling for them.  This is just one man relaying the painfully obvious truth about a tired old washed up dump.",12/11/2009,0,4,0,Wq78bcL610vT1nnB2Lj3pw

I wouldn't mind going again. The pizza we ordered was a little burnt on the bottom, but we ate it anyways. It was baked in their very own brick oven so we didn't mind! We can tell that fresh ingredients were used and it was good quality pizza. It better be because of the price. Frankly, Zachary's Pizza in California seemed to have tastier pizzas, but you have to wait a long time (30-40 minutes) for your pizzas at both spots. So, I suggest you go here when you're beginning to feel hungry, not when you feel like you're going to faint because you're starving lol.",10/14/2008,22,260,199,6a8XHypxGwNTRWqtqQsylQ

I'd say this was better than most (the sauce especially was awesome), but I wouldn't wait an hour to eat here again. Another note: They'll probably tell you that it will be ""25-40 minutes but may be less"" (I heard them say this to everyone), but it will likely actually be longer. We waited over an hour.

I have definitely had my share of pizza, but there are  so many other things I would rather eat when splurging calorie wise.....up until the time I experienced Lombardi's that is.   Yes, some ""hole-in-the-wall"" spots in NY serve up a good, but very greasy slice. Yes, there are some Italian restaurants that serve a fancy and decent tasting pizza. Lombardi's though gets it just right with a just the PERFECT amount of crispiness in their perfectly tasting crust,  the perfect amount of their perfectly formulated ""secret recipe"" sauce, the perfect amount of such smooth and wonderful mozzarella cheese, freshly chopped basil, and delicious pepperoni (not those thin flat pepperoni Domino's puts on their Pizza...sorry for bringing up Domino's!  yuk!) making it the best thin crust pizza I have ever had. For thick-crust it's Gino's East in Chicago or nothing at all.I may have to try and get somebody to dry ice one out to LA now that I am thinking about it again!Truly Folks, if you are ever in NY don't miss the PERFECT opportunity to take a trip down food heaven lane yourself.  : )",7/26/2007,37,60,1,iSkHqZTrnUlWMdlTzosozg

They were great and could easily be enjoyed as just a side.  The cheese pizza was simple but oh so delicious.  Great crust, slightly sweet tomato sauce bursting with tomato flavor, and terrific fresh mozzarella.Despite it being somewhat crowded, I think we had our pizza 10 mins after we ordered it.  We also ordered Italian sodas and while the kids didn't like them too much - I thought they were refreshing!The 2 large pizzas satisfied our party of 2 adults and 3 teens (2 boys, 1 girl).  No leftovers and we all walked away pretty full.Tab: 2 large pizzas, 1 coke, 3 Italian sodas + tax = $61 (before tip)",7/26/2010,3,36,0,MCEBZg7lE15w_XahEnuLyQ

5346,Ricky L.,0,4,"for the full review with pics:tastychomps.blogspot.com…Friday July 1812:32PMLuckily after finishing up our banh mi from Banh Mi Saigon, we didn't have too far to go as our next destination was only a few blocks away past the fruit vendors and gucci prada bags of Chinatown and into Little Italy for Lombardi's, the ""first"" official pizzeria to open in America.Lombardi's Pizza in New York City is widely known and recognized for popularizing pizza the way we know it today. Recently, the New York Magazine did a time line special of the pizza through time in 104 years of Pizza in New York in their Cheap Eats of 2009 issue.Though the current Lombardi's is down the street from the original, there is still a continuum of sorts dating back to the original Lombardi's. Over a hundred years of pizza history? I've got to check it out.As we walked up on Mott Street approaching Spring Street, I noticed on the corner a huge mural of Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa greeting us with a pizza pie and smiling, letting us know that we are ""here at Lombardi's"".There was a line of people waiting for the dining room area, but that was okay since we were on a mission and had to keep moving. We told the hostess that we wanted to get take out and she told us to head towards the back and make a right and then a left to order, right where the pizza oven was! What a surprise that our adventure led us into the Lombardi's coal oven room, where pizza makers were hard at work putting their classic pizza creations together.We were recommended by the man at the register to get the pepperoni as it is delicious here, and so we ordered a small personal pizza half pepperoni and half plain margarita (cheese and tomatoes) (about$18). It is important to note that they do not sell pizza by the slice here only by the pie made fresh to order.We wait for our pizzas at the bar and enjoy a nice cold glass of Yeungling beer (it's actually German Amerian not Chinese) straight from the tap. The beer was cool and refreshing, as the sun had been steadily getting warmer outside and we needed a drink from the trek. Bad Idea, since it filled us up quite a bit and probably slowed us down a bit (but it was a good beer nevertheless).Soon, the dining room's waiting area filled up to the brim. I was glad that we were in the bar area and had placed our orders already to go. The pizza arrived and we downed our drinks before stepping outside to sit on another stoop to behold the famous pizza in our hands.The pizza came in six slices with a flat crust, slighty charred and smoky from the coal oven pizza. The pizza had fresh mozzarella, a red tomato sauce, fresh basil and on half the pizza were the little circular quarter pieces of pepperoni. It is important to note that the pizza, like all the pizza made here in New York is said to have a distinct light tasty goodness because they use the New York City tap water.The pizza I thought was good, not the worst ever by far but not the best I ever had. The cheese was fresh but tasted a bit bland and the tomato sauce was a bit watery causing the crust to moisten and soggify. The pepperoni pieces on the pizza however was excellent, crunchy and spiced to a savory crisp satisfying the tastebuds.Overall, it was okay but definitely a bit too hyped up. It is a good pizza, and it may be the first pizza, but it wasn't the greatest.With a pizza box carton half full, we proceed onward to our next stop: The Tuck Shop, a Australian Meat Pie shop.",7/24/2009,513,261,1688,4s-SO0yFb-gmlPutpFK5fw
5347,Jessica G.,0,4,"I probably don't need to review a place that already has over a thousand reviews!  :)  So I'll just say that the restaurant is larger than it appears so there's more seating than you'd think.  Waiting for a table isn't too bad.  And, most importantly, the meatball pizza is AMAZING.  :)",1/21/2011,0,14,0,vGQCseA44sLpRQSC_TZizg
5348,Crazy Bernie S.,0,5,There's enough pizza to choose from in new York to confuse anybody. So if you're gonna listen to anyone listen to a native new yorker. I travel home to new York yearly to do one thing. Eat. And all I eat is pizza and chili dogs. The pizza style served at lombardis is the original first introduced by them here in late 1800s. Nothing has changed and it never will. If you don't eat at lombardis before you retreat to whatever pizzaless hell you live in then you have not been to new York.  Other coal oven choices include patsys and angelos and that is where the list ends. Forget about it.,12/5/2009,42,654,73,qzkA4pdGVtQOxYUOdQtuKA
5349,Danielle A.,0,4,We are from Arizona and made a visit to NYC. We were told by several people to try Lombardi's Pizza. So glad we did! It was delicious!

5350,TJ J.,0,5,"I'm picky about my pizza. I avoid eating pizza that's delivered from the usual delivery places like Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's. I didn't understand the hype of New York pizza until I was introduced to Lombardi's. Before Lombardi's, I preferred my pizza Chicago style, but now I highly regard their pizza as one of the best. Who knew meatballs, ricotta cheese, and basil can be an amazing pizza topping combination. The ingredients taste very fresh, and I like the crispy thin crust.",4/8/2008,82,318,65,cpUM9bOVufwQzpJcmBumuw

The servers look stressed and were running around like crazy on a Saturday night. So we decided to order a Margherita pizza for take out, which took about 20 minutes. The pizza itself was good but not incredibly special and was overpriced for the quality. It was a little cold and not as tasty as it looked. It was also slightly burned (ugh..). If you're into the whole touristy thing then this might be a place you want to check out once but I definitely think there are better pizza places out there and I don't think I'll be going here again.",1/18/2013,103,24,2,2w_sTGEe1WIypfm_vuKG1Q

Okay, so it's not a huge deal, but come on, you have to be a pretty big fan of the joint to risk being seen by the same waitstaff twice. (Not that the waitstaff has time to notice anybody during the busy hours.)I go to NYC at least once or twice a year, and this is the only restaurant I insist on going to every single time I'm there.

5393,Adam W.,0,5,"Lombardi's pizza is spot on! I really can't think of a single complaint I have about this restaurant. I showed up here with three other friends around 7:30 expecting to have to wait a long time to get a table, but we only had to wait 20 minutes before we were seated. I was really surprised by how large the inside of this place was and how nicely everything was decorated -- it's definitely a step up from the ambiance at some other famous holes-in-the-wall. I suppose there's really not much choice but to get the Margherita pizza after you sit down, so that's what we got (that said, they do offer a white pizza, but who wants to try something like that in such a renowned pizza establishment as this one??). Our waitress came to give us our cups of water promptly after we were seated, we placed our order a few minutes later, and the pizza came out in a matter of only a few minutes (it seemed like no more than 10 to me).As for the pizza, it was absolutely excellent. An 18"" pie is pretty big, but I honestly think I could eat the entire thing by myself because of how good it tastes. The fresh mozzarella and basil that top even the plain pizza are delicious, but the sauce is really what makes this pizza great. The sauce has a very smooth consistency, but also has a lot of tang to it. Despite the fact that it's so smooth, it still tastes really fresh, as if it was made with very fresh ingredients, but cooked down to a sauce reduction (I have no idea how they actually make it, but that was the impression I got from the taste). The crust was also excellent -- I thought it might taste burnt from some of the pictures I saw, but it wasn't burnt by any means, really delicious. Beyond that, it'll cost you $20 for this pizza, which I now have little doubt is the best in Manhattan. As a New Yorker, you really have an obligation to try this place -- you'd be missing out if you didn't.",5/6/2009,15,152,1,dPJHJQvtSYjFykTH--yrFw
5394,B K.,0,4,This is a damn good slice of pizza. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that there was a piece of string accidentally baked into my piece of pizza!  Yuck!

And because it is NYC and we are all probably eating far worse things that have accidentally fallen into our food. But still...yuck. So a 1 star deduction.,11/22/2009,58,337,12,Hcr4-587KLy0TzaoZgSIeQ

5397,Candyce P.,0,3,"So... when I was told we were going for NY pizza, I immediately thought yummy greasy cheesy pizza. Not the case at Lombardi's. We ordered two large cheese pizzas, and two house salads. I must say, the house salad was really good, and served in those old wooden bowls that our parents have stored away somewhere.. kind of nostalgic actually. Then came our pizzas, hot and delicious. It is traditional neapolitan pizza and quite delicious. They serve it with the usual pizza accompaniments: parmesan, chili flakes, oregano... and also a little container of minced garlic. Half the table thoroughly enjoyed adding minced garlic onto their pizza slice... me, not so much. There wasn't enough cheese on the pizza for my taste, but the sauce was good enough to not whine and just eat. The pizza was good, though, and definitely hit the spot after a tipsy night out. If you're looking for that greasy cheese pizza though, I'd suggest picking it up from a hole-in-the-wall type spot!",9/2/2009,131,170,0,-U3o87ZrOBKDC4gKU12tGg

The pizza was good- each ingredient tasted very fresh. Not too high in sodium.... not too oily.... overall it tasted healthy.

They serve beer on tap which just adds to the experience. I am bias because our waitress was extremely attractive but the staff working were on top of things.

They tend to char the crust over here so make sure you tell them otherwise if you prefer a softer, chewier crust.  The best slice is the white clam pie and if you are lover of clam and garlic, don't  miss this one.

I also tried my friend's garlic spinach which had excellent tomato sauce, but again his spinach had a kick but just was not what I expected.

Executive Summary: I was not disappointed.I'm sure there are many jaded NY'ers who have had too much of the good stuff, but I haven't found a good Neopolitan style pizza in California.The caprese was outstanding.  Nothing fancy, just straightforward and honest, made with high quality ingredients.  I went down a somewhat unusual road of picking ""sauteed garlic spinach"" with my mix of meats.  In retrospect, that was not a good combination.  No more sauteed anything on pizzas from now.  I didn't appreciate the contrast.The crust was perfect - burnt on the edges but still pliable on the bottom.  The volume of cheese and sauce was perfect and did not overwhelm the toppings. In contrast with the last Neopolitan pizza I tried, Two Amys in DC, Lombardi's pizza had better all round balance, and better price.

5459,Henry B.,0,3,"I am giving 3 of my 5 stars to Lombardi's for the service and atmosphere alone.  After trying Grimaldis in Brooklyn I decided to try and visit all of the best rated pizza joints in the city..  I visited Lombardi's on Monday night around 8pm and was expecting at least a 30 minute wait.  To my surprise, the wait was only about 10 minutes (just enough time to order 2 drinks at the bar.)  We were then instructed to follow the host through what seemed like a maze of the Lombardi's restaurant.  After passing through the kitchen and to the connecting dining room we were presented with a tiny 2 seater which offered enough room for both of us and the food (they serve the pizzas on ""space savers"" which basically lift the pizza to face height.  They didn't have 2 menus so we shared one, not a big deal, and the waitress greeted us promptly.  Since this was the first time we've been to Lombardi's we decided to play it safe and get a plain pizza with half mushrooms and a caesar salad.  The caesar salad was great, but the pizza was a bit disappointing.  The presentation of the pizza was great, typical old style NYC pizza, but it was just missing something that neither of us could put our fingers on.  The cheese wasn't that great, the sauce was a bit plain, mushrooms were very fresh which was great, but they weren't cooked enough, and the dough tasted a bit like thin cardboard (or at least how I would think cardboard would taste like.)  They don't take credit cards so make sure you bring enough cash, and I recommend going across the river to Grimaldis if you're looking for the best pizza in NYC.Maybe it was an off night?  I'm not sure so I will give it another shot after I hit up Grimaldis and edit my post accordingly.",10/18/2007,23,119,1,yx9V9AgWAcrLGQFgEj2AVw

5462,A O.,0,5,"This is America's first pizzeria.  There is a reason it's still around: because the pizza is copied but not surpassed.  Crust is crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside (never dry like some other Neopolitan pizzerias).  Sauce is savory with a flavorful tomato taste - never too sweet, just the right taste and consistency.  Fresh mozz, homemade pepperoni.  Sure its a tourist mecca and they rush you out the door at times - but even to a NYer its always worth it.",7/6/2012,4,147,2,sy_hwluk_ooPhP_GT6mr4g

It's basically just the crust of the pizza with tons of clam pieces, garlic and cheese. The crust on this was perfect. Sprinkle some lemon and enjoy. The regular pies were also pretty good. I liked that they didn't charge us extra when we asked to spilt the pie with different topping choices on each side(unlike Grimaldis). The bottom of the pies had minimal carbon soot that sometimes appears on pies made with brick ovens, I appreciate that. Definitely go here.

My theory is that it's all in the ingredients. I ordered the 14"" classic pizza and added Pancetta, Black Olives and Mushrooms. Everything tasted fresh, organic and delicious. The pizza crust had that wood-oven-baked rustic quality to it and the basil garnish awakened my palette. There is good pizza all over New York, but Lombardi's is at the very least really good and uniquely authentic.",5/20/2009,41,27,5,Zts2nXrv2YIi0DLQElX6Bw
5465,Joseph C.,0,2,"For a few years I've been on a quest for the best pizza in NYC,and I was eager to taste pies from the first pizzeria inAmerica. I even brought some friends who used to live here.Having grown up in Rome, Italy, I appreciate the crust morethan the topping, which seems to be the main criterion forAmerican palates.Alas, Lombardi's was a big disappointment. The crust wasthinner than the American average, but still not as thin asRoman (Latium) style pizzas'. On the other hand, the dough wasnot as savory as the best (thicker) doughs that can be found inthe Neapolitan pizzerias that sport the brand ""Vera Pizza.""I was surprised to find myself even more let down by thetopping. Our second pie was their ""Original Pizza,"" which ispretty much the ""Margherita"" you can have in Naples. Thetopping was so scarce as though they had run out ofingredients. There were few shreds of basil leaves, littlemozzarella, and if there was any grated Romano it must haveevaporated.A sprinkle of (hopefully extra virgin) olive oil on the pieright out of the oven, like the do in some Italian pizzerias,or even here (I've seen it done at di Fara's which is a parlorand does not have the benefit of a wood or coal-fired oven),would have rescued the pie by softening the crust, especiallythe large swaths that had not had the benefit of topping, aswell as enriching its flavor. I tried this trick on the slicewe brought home, as an experiment. It tasted better out of myhumble toaster oven than fresh from Lombardi's oven.I hope our visit was just a bad night for Lombardi's, but theyare far from topping my ranking. John's on Bleeker, despitetheir inconsistencies, is much better in my humble opinion.",1/27/2011,0,3,0,ZG-b2-_xOoTVZVbNxXAeQg
5466,A T.,0,4,"Bad things first: you have to wait and wait and wait and wait, oh and did I mention wait? If you haven't made a reservation be prepared to wait anywhere between 1-2 hours. And when you have to stand in the cold for 1.5 hours (yes it really did happen), the pizza better be really good.Which it was, really really good pizza. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza for 3 of us, the size was perfect with 8 slices.. one of which we had to run out with unless we wanted to miss our broadway show. The pizza has a very thin crust and is loaded with enough pepperoni to give me a heart attack. A little more cheese on the pizza wouldn't have hurt but thats only because I love it so much. My friends seems to think it was just about right or it would've weighed down the slices. Our server was extremely busy but did her best to attend to us every now and then. In fact, when we let her know we were running late and our pizza took longer than ever, she gave us a free breadstick basket. Woohoo! The dipping sauce for the sticks was nothing like I've ever had before, LOVED IT! You know the pizza is good when you take your first bite, when people stand in line for hours for it. In the rain. In the mean streets of NYC (I'm only half kidding).My advice is to plan ahead if you don't have a reservation. Trust me, you don't want to run on the streets while eating that last slice so you don't miss the opening line of Chicago. Esp. if its your first broadway show ever.

5467,Jon C.,0,5,"There is a reason they have been in business since 1905. Coal fired ovens make a pizza that is just very original as nobody make it due to environmental laws, plus who has a coal oven these days? The wait for a table can be a bit harsh if you have a large party of like 6 or so. groups of 3-4 goes by quickly. The eggplant, the original, everything is great. If you think its overpriced then you dont live in NYC. You are also paying for the history and the ambiance it has. Sure do other people have other favorite places but they havent been in business since 1905. Fads come and go but quality products stay through time thats all i got to say!

5507,H B.,0,5,"I was walking around Little Italy a few years ago and the craving for Pizza hit. Unfortunately I had no guide book and no one to call for advice. What does one do in this situation, go to the nearest bakery, confront a waitress and ask them where they would go if they could only have one more pizza in their lifetime. The waitress gave us only one answer, ""You gotta go to Lombardi's.""I knew I was in for a treat when we got there at 6:45pm and there was a line going out the door and around the corner. It started raining and as we stood there for an hour the aroma and chinese lady trying to sell us an umbrella kept us company. After an hour and a half we were seated, the restaurant is small and quaint, the pies around us looked delicious. While I was in the mood to be adventurous and try the clam pizza the idea was nixed by my compatriot. So we went classic, medium pizza with pepperoni, red peppers and linguica sausage. The first thing that i noticed about our pie was that I asked for it well done and they did it right, the crust was crispy, the cheese perfectly melted and the topping looked delicious. Much to our pleasure the pies were just as good as they looked. Now, when people ask me where to go for pizza in NY this is where I send them.While it is not in the same place it was when they first opened so many years ago you still feel like you are in a place with history.",9/14/2009,67,702,9,Ht8iGitRu8kynEubcIhsTQ
5508,Ash L.,0,3,"In case you were wondering if the pizza is still good if you take it to-go (to avoid the crazy long wait) and heat it up in the oven to eat afterwards, my answer is, ""I think so."" At least the cheese was still very thick and stringy. It tasted like a good thing. However, I wish my friends and I would've been able to enjoy our first bite of a NY pizza that came right out of an oven, since we came from Orange County, Calif. for a vacation and wanted to experience anything that New York is known for. Oh well. We'll try again another time and have a slice when it's oober fresh and cheesy. A con would be the price. Over $20 bucks for a small pizza for two toppings is a bit much for my blood.",1/9/2010,21,60,33,BTrTscK0G3Mh6B1codJ_vQ

Most of the places that get a lot of hype are usually terrible. However, Lombardi's was an exception. The pizza is always hot and fresh. (I'm not too crazy about their crust... but I guess that depends on your crust preference.) I usually go with a friend and share a pie. The service is alright. Bottom line: It's good but not good enough to go out of my way to eat there. If I'm in the area and it's dinner time, yeah, sure, I'll stop by. But if you're not that close, I'm sure you can find a pizza place that will make a pie for you within a five block radius that you'll enjoy just as much, perhaps even more.",7/31/2008,1,13,0,njU3_vwp8lw8ZOaq4MvHEg
5526,Tech A.,0,2,"Lombardi's pizza is not that great, to call it overrated is a understatement as I don't seee how much of good points in the pizza and how it got to be overrated.Many people I have spoke to have said they have gone to lombardi's for the last 10 years and recently over the last 2 years they have declined in quality.The service in the resturant is not that great but the waiter service is okay, the don't take credit cards and they seem to lack certain facilities of a more modern resturant such as not serving ice coffee but serving regular coffee and someone throwing ice in it which is  poor way to service ice coffee which would taste weak or bitter. I have been informed that seating and capacity was upgraded but not the pizza.The staff is not unfriendly so that is a great point although they don't seem to be too amazed and loving their job they do seem happy at times. At first I thought I was having great pizza, it was a different style but I soon realized that is was just a different style and not necessarily good pizza. The pizza was undercooked a bit and overcooked a bit especially on the crust. The tomato sauce seemed to taste fine at first because of the combination of the cheese and sauce but eventually it turned out to be not much of a big deal.Its very pricy lombardi's for what you are getting.  Its overated and a lot of marketing and advertisitng is what's keeping it in business. Whether its on the food network, old reviews, tourist traps,etcIts not horrible pizza, people who think its great may be used to pizza hit and haven't really tried or not what great pizza is. I have to give it two stars because its overpriced and hyped and really not that great in its category of gourmet pizzas.As for the sodas, I had italian soda in addition to the pepporoni and sausage pizza . The soda was vanilla and I really had to ask the waiter to put sugar syrup in it because it wasn't sweet it all, at first I thought well maybe its the style of the soda not too sweet, but really it had like no sweetness to it at all.A lot of reviewers, have agreed with me, the curst is burnt or under and overcooked, most of the time the sauce is good although my experience with two different pizzas indicates one of them had either two little or two much meat or cheese or sauce.Be aware that the prices are 3 times their competitors and the atmosphere is not that great especially since it can get crowded with tourists although when I was at the place it wasn't too crowded in the late afternoon. The pizza is also started to taste as if it was not propertly made as in the past as some reviewers had stated. It seemed as if the staff may have been a bit too hasty in prepearing the pizza and with high demand that may have been the case. One person questioned whether they were stretching the dough ,and if so was the pizza pre-packaged or hastily prepared.The person at the front desk when you walk greets you but you can tell she is just an employee and is basically doing what she is scripted to do and her face looks as if she knows this place is a bit guilty in overcharging customers for what they are getting, I am not sure if she is still there, now",4/22/2009,0,11,0,aC5PrDDZkJYyIdunlhm1oA

I couldn't wait to try some good NY pizza and thought for sure I would love this place but they let me down. The pizza here tastes just like Virginia pizza, in other words it's nothing special. I really hope this place isn't the best NY has to offer, I didn't get to try grimaldis pizza but maybe they're better. Don't waste your time going here.

The pizza was delicious (but then again I like just about all pizza, just some more than others). The pricing was fair, but I'll say a bit on the expensive side. The place is pretty large, with plenty of seating, but that didn't stop my wait for a table from being about an hour.   I do like how you're able to pick your own toppings, but then again you are ordering a whole pizza vs. a slice like your typical NY Pizza joint.    So why 3 stars...well it's not a terrible places, but on my next visit to NYC, I don't think I'm gonna make it a point to stop in unless I'm just around the area. The pizza is good, probably one of the best I've had in NY...and I ate at a LOT of pizzerias. However, given that most Pizza in NY is delicious, much faster to get, and cheaper...it's just really not worth making a special trip IMO.

5545,Taylor K.,0,4,"During our recent trip to NYC, I wanted to sample several pizza joints and Lombardi's was definitely on my must-try list. Lombardi's is situated on the corner of Spring St and Mott St and less than two blocks from the Spring Street metro; so its easy to get to. Walking into Lombardi's definitely feels like you are walking back in time into an old, narrow, brick walled speakeasy-type place. We walked into the front bar and dining area and the hostess walked us back through narrow passages, making turns through the kitchen, and around several corners into the original brick walled dining room. My wife and I split a small (6 slices) with pepperoni. Yes we are in NYC, but at $20 for a small/6 slice pizza seems a bit overpriced. The pizza itself was VERY good; cooked in a coal oven with sweet tomato sauce, a crisp, but not burned, crust and the cheese tasted very fresh and the pepperoni small/crisp/ with just a hint of spiciness. They don't do refills on drinks, besides water, and its CASH ONLY. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and the pizza was definitely good. Not the best I've ever had; but definitely worth trying. Lombardi's may be a bit touristy and overpriced; but I would definitely recommend stopping by this classic joint in Little Italy if you are a pizza lover, if only to say you have been to the first pizza place in America!",6/2/2014,3,75,4,15Q2jMGBvQsGUjlcXCaiLA

Even if there's only two or three of you, get the large size pizza because there's something superior in texture about it (I can't really explain it). I suggest getting the meatball, ricotta, & spinach pizza. They will let you do half & half combos if you want to try another kind, too. Also, don't eat it like a sissy.

5564,Ann R.,0,3,"After I read this (slice.seriouseats.com/ar…) article I wanted pizza almost everyday for month too. I wonder if I'm enough of a fatty to pull this off. Maybe not, if it has to be sausage pizza. Why?Me no likee the sausage.Anyway, I equate sausage pizza to thirteen year old boy food. You may be asking yourself, what other foods fall into this totally arbitrary category, Ann?Corn nuts, specifically ranch flavored ones, Slim Jims, that fake Tostito cheese with salsa in it. I can't say why these 'foods' fall into this specific classification, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's because this is what I remember Kevin greedily hoarding when we were younger. Also, Nerd Rope, even though I seem to recall Kevin hunting down this treat well into his college years...Back to the important issue at hand. PIZZA.Lombardi's Pizza is one of the city's oldest pizzaria's as well as one of the most popular. It touts itself as New York City's first pizzeria. Pretty cool, but while working briefly in Soho years ago, I tried it out during lunch. WAY disappointing. Everything was wrong, a tough ass crust, uncooked garlic, not salty enough. What was all the hype about?Jim suggested it was a fluke, so when someone suggested we meet there for a Sunday lunch, I magnanimously decided to give it a second go.We stuck to basics, and ordered a half white and half Margarita. A good choice, because the white pizza was overwhelming with all the ricotta, but in a good way. Sidenote: You know how when you order a bagel and they give you three times the amount of cream cheese you really need? That's too much in a good way, because when I get a bagel with half the amount that is necessary to enjoy the bagel, it kills my day. For real.The tomato-y tang of the Margarita nicely offset the creamy, cheese-y globs of ricotta. I found myself alternating bite-for-bite.My pizza pass/fail test is if eat the cold, leftover crusts on my plate after the pizza is gone. I ate about half of what was there, but I can't remember if I liked it or not. I might've just been really hungry that day. So not passing, but not failing either.Lombardi's round two was definitely better than round one, but the best pizza in the city? No, sadly, it was not.Also, it's cash only. That's just flat-out annoying.",1/5/2010,5,25,0,hZfQ3_ErDG0cwkwZjnPGRA

5572,chloe w.,0,2,The pizza here is not that great. My husband and I expected a lot bc of all the great reviews and were really looking forward to trying this place. The pizza was thin but it was soggy in the middle. The dough and crust was really good. It was salty and the tomato sauce was tasty. The cheese however was just kinda funky and not good. I love pizza and I must say the cheese on this pizza was just kinda gross. I picked it off all the slices I ate. It kinda reminded me of a  plastic cheese- not like a high quality cheese. It looked good when it came out but I just did not care for the taste. I added mushrooms to half of the pizza and that caused it to be pretty soggy which was also not too appetizing. I have to come here again to meet up for the scotts pizza tour my husband and I signed up for but we are gonna pass on the free slice of pizza that we get with the tour.,1/30/2010,5,150,63,91eF-7x4MREcBMSDfy-H0g

We were seated immediately and our server was so attentive and nice that my friend was absolutely floored at how great the service was.We ended up ordering a house salad and large pie half extra mozz and mushrooms and half red peppers and sausage. The crust was just the way I like it! Thin and crispy and the toppings while generous, not too heavy that it makes the slice impossible to eat.My friend fell in love at the first bite. She wanted to eat the entire pie!After a couple slices and a couple sangrias - we packed the rest up. As we were leaving Lombardi's, I kid you not, my friend turned to me and this is a direct quote: ""I had pizza when I was in Rome, and it did not taste as good as this pizza!""Lombardi's - another great job!

While waiting for some pants to be hemmed at Uniqlo, I ambled over here since I'm sick of people asking if I've been. Yeah, it was the ""first ever"" pizzeria and it's famous, etc. so fine I'll try it out. Usually, there's a line, but a street festival in Little Italy seemed to have drained off the usual tourist dregs, and I got in right away. The establishment is nice in a tourist trap sort of way, with ""professional service,"" the obligatory photos of barely recognizable celebs awkwardly smiling with the owner up on the walls, and a kitschy menu on which things are ""famous"" (and therefore expensive). That's right, $17 for the small margherita, delivered with ho-hum table-turning-over service. Is it possible to say a pizza is too crusty? This one was not only 20% crust, with only a thin layer of cheese and sauce, but it left a burnt crust taste in my mouth I don't even suffer at the street pizza joints. I had to ration out my tap water to wash it down, since no one ever came to refill my glass. Cash only, which makes me wonder what this place is a front for. If any ""friends"" of Lombardi's are reading this, please don't ""ace"" me. Go to Emporio, instead, right up the street.

Plus, it was featured on a Food Network special as one of the best pizzeria, so course, that convinced me even more to stop by. The wait was long, but my group and I decided to wait the 20-30 minutes. After waiting outside in the cold for a bit, we managed to find seats at the bar and have a drink before being called. The place is rather small, but it has a nice and cozy feeling. We were sat at the end of the restaurant away from the big crowd, which was nice. We ordered the house salad and a large pizza with peperoni. There was a total of four people in the group, and our order was more than enough. The salad was really good, especially their house vinaigrette dressing. I think I even served myself twice. The pizza was excellent. All the ingredients were fresh, and each slice was bursting with flavor. I'm not sure what type of pizza this is. I would categorize it as a thin crust although it is slightly thicker than usual, but it's definitely not thick/deep dish. Service was great. Everything was prompt, and our server always checked up on us to make sure we were okay with drinks. At the end of our meal, we were so full that we had a slice of pizza left over. I would recommend this place for anyone that is visiting NY for the first or fifth time. Its a mush go to place.",5/12/2010,0,30,2,vAcc85W4SaQcaFyPIilKnA

We ordered the Margherita since my friend is vegetarian, so maybe the meat pizzas have more taste. The crust had that cardboard type feel and there was barely any basil. It wasn't bad pizza.

By eating delicious pizza almost every late-night, I had some high expectations for Lombardi's Pizza. And my expectations were totally met.We ordered the margherita pizza with meatballs and fresh mushrooms and it was the most delicious thin crust pizza I've ever had. The sauce was so fresh and the toppings were great, too.The only complaints I had about the place were:-We sat next to the door and the constant in-and-out of crowds of people meant that the door was always open. Resulted in quite a chilly dinner.-We didn't have cash and had to use the ATM with a 3.00 transaction fee.

(obviously there are some anomalies of course) Your tables are actually far enough not to be on top of other people's conversations. When I went to Grimaldi's, even though the pizza is compareable the seating was horrendous. I'm ok with common dining but that was a little ridiculous .

First bite, I thought it was a really good pizza. The crust was nice and crispy, the way I like it. As I started on my 2nd and 3rd slices though, other thoughts came into my head. That crispy crust was starting to become abrasive on my tongue, like sandpaper, and there wasn't quite enough sauce or cheese to help ""wash"" it down.

5643,Kyle M.,0,4,"Lombardi's is very high quality pizza with only a few things that could use improvement. Three problems:1)The cheese is a thin and sporadic, I get that this is the old Italian way of making pizza, but I suspect that limited cheese was to keep cost down, at 15.50 for a small pizza I don't thinking having a pie with plenty of cheese is too much to ask. 2)The sauce is good, but not great, it's sweet but not quite as complex in flavor as I normally enjoy. Price - it is expensive. As I said 15.50 for a small pizza that realistically speaking 1 person can finish alone. However non of these things are deal breakers, it's still really tasty pizza and definitely worth getting. The service is really good also. One note about the toppings, specifically the sweet Italian sausage, I'd recommend it, this is really good sausage and adds tremendously to the flavor, however the sausage is EXTREMELY salty make sure your prepared for that (ie if your going to be walking around the city all day choose another topping).",7/31/2009,5,47,0,cBmceT3n50ZItb_7aGVRrA

The thin crust, the thick, juicy sauce and the cheese all combined for a heavenly slice. The only thing that might deter me from coming here again was the 45 min wait.

Why don't they just call you when the table is ready?Then they lined us up like it was an amusement park ride line and lead us single file into the back. Also: beware: the breadsticks are literally long rolls. No cheese, garlic, etc. on them. They are sticks of bread with marinara sauce on the side.

BUT, I HAD to write something on Lombardi's since it was so AWFUL. I have had pizza many many places and this was by far the absolute worst and the most disappointing. Had they not written everywhere ""the best place on the planet"" I would still have been disappointed, but when your expectations go up with all the (self-proclaimed) hype, you are even more disappointed. two of us had a veggie pizza with 4 toppings and the other two meat pizza again with 4 topping.  They were both SOOOO SOGGY, it was falling apart. You can't even taste the crust it's that soggy. What's even worse is that it didn't even taste like pizza, i think they  need to re-think their pizza sauce. I understand the sauce is fresh, but that shouldn't come at the expense of TASTE!!! my mom was right, it was missing oregano. How can you make pizza without oregano? At the end, when we had paid and were leaving, my party of four could not contain ourselves any longer and told the waitress that the dough was very very soggy and she had the nerve to tell me that i've never tasted fresh pizza!!!! WTF??? i have had awesome pizza in rome and all over the place. ANYWAY, do NOT waste ur money. It's too bad that places like this just get a reputation and stick some celeb pictures on their walls, hoping to make up for their lack of taste.  oh, and one more thing, there was barely any topping on the pizza.Shame on ZAGAT for giving this place such a high rating, clearly they are paid off.

The only drawback is all the pictures of the goofy owner all over the place. The guy thinks he's very photogenic, think Lou Ferrigno before he fell apart.  This place lives up to the hype. They claim to have introduced the pizza to America, and they may well have.

The pizza came out maybe after 10-15 minutes, quite fast; it was brick oven I went by the kitchen and saw it myself -a large hole surrounded by white bricks--this is the real deal; for all those whiney whiners, you have been having lousy pizza all your life which is why you cannot tell the difference; this is oven cooked thin crust pizza people!! The topping s were terrific. The ricotta melted in your mouth, I loved the meatballs, you can tell it was developed with a flavor that melted in your mouth. There's no comparison to our $0.99 pizza round our corner or dry corner pizza in our hood, it's far more superior-let your tastebuds absorb it--maybe also you guys come when it's too crowded better when there's less people you get great service and food is excellent they can take thier time,  I told the waiter he was very nice and unusually friendly thank you, he said oh, where are you from, I said NY. But my hubby and his friend had British accents, but friendly waitstaff is nice for  a change and a breath of fresh of air our waiter was a young guy who looks Italian--kudos to you; we left a nice littel 20% tip, great food, great service, great company!

I think this is definitely one of those places where less is more, get a plain margherita or a white, too many ingredients just weighs it down and you lose the true flavor, particularly of the crust. I have taken visitors who have done this, (probably why I left unhappy). Please don't load it up with a bunch of extras, if you want a salad, order a salad, don't put it on your pizza and complain you have to eat it with a fork and knife because the slice is to heavy to pick up, or that it is too wet because of all the sweating vegetables on top.",4/5/2008,0,54,0,fmbD-qZILCZbFf31eEP59g

The white pizza tasted unique--not a big fan of ricotta but it wasn't too chalky like other places..the mozzarella was incredibly fresh! The wild mushroom pizza is better for a light lunch--it was tasty but not as flavorful as it looked...and for my favorite of the night: the roasted peppers..WOW, they brought out the savory sweet flavors of the rest of my slice beautifully and mixed really well with the tomato sauce and basil. I almost forgot about the cheese--thats how good the peppers were.Lombardi's..worth the wait, but very cramped when you go with a large group (over 6). Fresh basil, cheese, sauce, perfect thin hand tossed crust, and juuust right amount of oil to keep the pizza hot but no so much that orange oil dribbles down your hand as you fold it (although I don't mind that too much..I'm a Brooklyn boy that loves his oily Brooklyn pizza).I didnt notice the service much--they just said hello, took your order, served it to you and left you alone, which I prefer anyway.",3/27/2009,0,156,0,-ipe4RBLU62yo_jHhEVttg

I'm a born and raised New Yorker and  found Lombardi's pizza to be just another pizza. They may have been the first but maybe not the best. Service was so-so, we went early so no lines, the pizza was soggy, oily (as oppose to other yelpers claims), and they were stingy with the toppings. Maybe I went on a day when everything was going wrong, i really dont understand the 5stars from some people. My drink had either paper or lettuce floating inside and the tap or water from the hose was cloudy. Dont get me wrong, the pizza wasnt crap off the floor but it was just another pizza nothing to rave about.         We ordered a large for 2(we were starving) but I think a small would have been fine.This place is really relying on their rep. for being the first pizza place  to get customers.",8/7/2009,0,5,1,kPr_Ys5LQFpyWSLOKS2uVQ

5729,A K.,0,5,"First of all, make sure you bring cash. This place doesn't take creds and that's fine - that's New York for you. But between the pizza and the sangria, you'll want to be sure you got cash.Everyone probably already knows about the pizza here. And yes, it really IS that GOOD!The sauce is awesome and so flavorful. The crust is fantastic - one of those crusts that you DO WANT to eat! Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside, a really good and tasty crust.The pizza sauce is incredibly flavorful with an explosion of flavors, ingredients, and spices.Their margharita pizza - cheese pizza - is delicious. The flavors they put into the sauce melds together with the crust and mozarella. The white pizza is an explosion of garlic and basil and ricotta cheese - which they must put on the pizza with a frosting piper because the ricotta has a cool looking flowery design.But yes, the pizzas are great, are yum, and definitely the finest PURE pizza you can find (I happen to like a good Chicago deep dish and Pizza Hut type pizza on occasion, so that's why i distinguish ""pure"" pizza).So besides the pizza, what else is great about this place? Something the travel and food shows won't show you - the sangria.The sangria is awesome. Very tasty, and goes great with the pizza. My DC friend and I discovered this the first time we were here. After a day of exploring the city and eating here and there, we ended with dinner at Lombardi's. I decided to try a sangria and ordered one for her as well. Well - we should have bought a pitcher because we ordered 2 glasses each (4 in total) and that equaled to the price of a pitcher - which actually equals more than 4 glasses (we came back a 2nd time with an additional friend and the 3 of us each had 2 glasses of Sangria!).They make the sangria very nice - there's the red wine taste but it's mellowed out by the fruitiness and the garnish is exquisite - orange and cherry.

We ordered 3 Pizzas The White pizza , clam and garlic pizza, and half cheese and half pepperoni, mushroom and olive.  The Crust was amazing- the best i have ever had- 5 star on crust. Nobody liked the White pizza- I would skip unless you like ricotta. The clam and garlic was good but not the best i have had. It was light on the garlic.  If you order ask for extra garlic. The best clam and garlic award goes to Village Pizzeria in San Francisco. The 3rd pizza was ok . we were expecting a black olive but got an Italian olive that made the flavors weird.

5782,Robby M.,0,4,"Read all over the internet that Lombardis has the best pie in NYC so I knew I had to try it. Took the extra-humid subway downtown to give it a shot. I'm generally not a fan of NY style pizza because I'm a deep dish, doughy crust kind of guy. Thin burnt crust doesn't really do it for me. Even with a little black on the bottom the crust usually takes on an bitter, ashy taste. I digress. I was seated as soon as I arrived. The downstairs area didn't have the same character as upstairs and it certainly wasn't bustling with conversation and the sounds of the city -- but I didn't mind. I ordered a small with pepperoni and a beer. It took just the right amount of time to come out for me to work up a nice hunger. Took my first bite and let me tell you, I was a changed man. The crust was thin, but not crispy or burnt. It was soft, and very fresh tasting. The sauce wasn't your standard, sugary store-bought crap. It actually tasted of fresh tomato. The pizza had a thin layer of fresh, aromatic mozzarella. I know i keep saying fresh, but really -- that word describes the pizza perfectly. In Beverly Hills, New York style pizza means overloaded with grease and cheese - blah. This wasn't that. Finished my pizza and beer, came upstairs, and it was pouring rain.

It was hot outside and the cold drinks were refreshing - the peach flavor was just right. We ended up ordering a 14"" (6 pieces) with spinach, mushrooms, and prosciutto. I was ravenous and knew I would enjoy every bite of the pizza. We each got 2 slices and it was the perfect combination of toppings and well spread. They were generous with toppings and cheese and the crust was made perfect (crunchy on the edges but not burnt). I don't normally eat crust but this crust I ate -- a testament to how good this pizza is.

5789,chile o.,0,2,"We just happened across Lombardi's scouting the neighborhood. I had forgotten that I had researched this place, and it got me all giddy that we were in front of on of the original pie joints in America. The front was crowded, but they walked us through the kitchen to an empty back room. They seated us and one other couple. They took our drink order, then came back several minutes later to take our food order. We settled in to wait for things to arrive. About five minutes went by, and my girl's house salad came out. She enjoyed it very much, and I thought the taste of the vinaigrette was outstanding. It sure made me thirsty, though. Would be nice to have those drinks. So I look around the now full dining room for our waitress, and she's serving pizzas to people who seemingly just arrived. This goes on for a good ten minutes before our drinks finally show up. Then a whole slew of other tables get their pizzas. Then my pie finally shows. Small pepperoni. Tough pie to make, I guess. It is warmish enough, I guess, and has decent flavor. Then a family shows up with a girl in a wheel chair. The staff wants us to move because this is the only table to accommodate a wheel chair. I'm okay with it, but I can't help but think that we probably would already be gone if we had gotten our food and drinks in a timely manner. So after the musical tables, I go back to my pie, and it is now ice cold. Totally ruined experience. As I sat picking at my cold soggy excuse for pizza, I began to notice the pictures on the wall. I'm sure you've noticed that famous joints often have pictures of famous people, possibly standing next to the owner of said establishment. Well, not here. The pictures here are just of the guido douchebag who owns the joint. If there was ever an example of a NY prick, this has got to be the president of the club.If you want good NY pie, I like Cee's Pizzeria. If you want coal fired thiiiin crust, go to Pepe's in New Haven CT. What a complete disappointment! Worst tip I left on my stay in NY.",6/6/2010,146,56,9,G00FQW6-Pi6FjxDSNRWdeQ

I found that quite rude, especially since we were there to celebrate my cousin's marriage. Hmph. Then when the two other people came they had to sit at the bar, because of course there were no tables available. RUDE! But they pizza was excellent, as was the salad (spinach, yum!). I got a vegetarian pizza of spinach, olives, and mushrooms. You must order extra cheese to get any cheese worth talking about. But it's good.

Horrible right?? And the place had only 8 ppl which were my family of 3 and a different family of 5....I say, you could do better at sparros....",9/2/2010,0,1,0,gkm1-yxB9jn3rK4nE5eBmg

5822,Maritess D.,0,4,"i went to NY back in June and heard this place was a must visit.  my friends and i went and this place is pretty small and there was a LONG wait, and nowhere to really wait at.  ppl were sitting on the floor it was just hot and cramped in there and it just gets awkward cuz u and strangers have nothing to do but look at each other as u wait for a table.  we decided to just order to go, so they tell u to go back to the kitchen and that's where u place ur to go order.  while we waited for our pizza we stopped by rice to riches which is across the street :)  anyways the pizza is worth the hype it's just sooo good.  We ordered the white pizza which has a bunch of diff white cheeses and garlic oil...mmmmm and the original pizza with sausage BUT they forgot to put sausage on our pizza :( and we were already on the cab back to the hotel...the original was still pretty good anyways.  i would like to try and dine in if i ever come back to ny :)",10/12/2011,104,46,15,z5ZQbIAPtxAMFdZOgrOzTQ
5823,Lisa D.,0,2,"Oh my, this place is such a tourist trap! Having grown up in the New Haven area, I know my thin crust, crunchy pizzas--this one pales in comparison. The sauce was bland, the dough was bland, and there wasn't enough cheese (and it all came off the slice with the first bite, leaving you with just bland saucy bread to eat). All this for $19.50--and that's with no additional toppings. Overpriced and overrated. Service, however, was friendly and prompt.  And the bathroom was clean, even though it was the end of the lunch rush.  At least there were some positives.",2/17/2010,2,68,13,v77-8NeCjIqEFNeaf0LlXw

5831,John N.,0,2,"Right after our meal in ChinaTown, we walk to Little Italy to look around so I made a joke to my friend about let go try Lombardi's pizza because we are so close by. Anyway she say yes and I was laughing so hard because I was so stuff from eating already but I am not going give up the chance to try the 1st pizza place in the US. Anyway the line wasn't too long, a 20min wait plus I need my food to digest so i can eat more. We order the original margarita pizza(basil, mozzarella and tomato) pizza plus some red wines to wash it all down. The pizza came out fast and I was pretty disappointed with the taste of the pizza. It was bland to me so i had to add SALT and order more basil to add on the pizza. Anyway we took most of the pizza back because to me pizza alway taste better the next day so i wanted to give it another shot at it but the next day it still taste the same. I am glad that I try this place but i doubt I will come back here again. I rather eat at papaya king hot dogs!!!",8/9/2009,442,1044,159,nswWHjhUtnhuNlPS67HBsg
