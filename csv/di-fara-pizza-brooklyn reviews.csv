1,Pepper P.,0.0,2,(NOTE: Take a moment to look at how many burnt pizza photos there are in the recent food feed. If you go here or receive a burnt pie from delivery make sure you complain.)I went to Di Farra for the first time about four years ago and my husband and I had an amazing pie. It was made by the owner Dom DeMarco and the pie was cooked perfectly and the ingredients were fresh and well balanced. Now I live in the neighborhood and I've gone there on multiple occasions and ordered delivery and every pie I've had is completely burnt and barely edible. The other day when I went the place was completely packed. The man running the counter had a notebook with names but he was also cooking the pizza and it was a total disorganized mess. I stood there for about 15 minutes while two pies sat on the counter at which point he started going back through the notebook and handing out slices to people in the list. I don't understand why he would hand out all the slices as soon as the pizza cans out of the oven. I'm disappointed that I paid $6 for a completely blackened piece of pizza. Despite the fact that I live down the block I'm never going back.,7/14/2019,32,88,37,lLiDXEWgo-cIJZja_nxwyw
2,Sophy G.,0.0,3,"Guys I'm so sorry I don't agree with the majority. Being from Brooklyn and raised between Bensonhurst and Dyker Heights I've had my share of ooey gooey, cheese stretching, oil dripping pizza but this my friends was overhyped. I walked in on a Friday afternoon and after standing there for 20 mins was told I needed to move to the right and put my name on a book. They write down the type of pizza, how many slices and your name onto a spiral notebook. Right before you get your pizza they drizzle oil on it. I'm not why this is needed. They also cut some basil onto it. Now I'm a basil lover therefore I appreciate that touch. The pizza in itself didn't have any thing to rave about. I'm gluten intolerant so I'm pretty upset that I risked having rashes all over my body for this",7/6/2019,21,52,100,k0yI5eNRNcnpE-1baq7XfA
3,Nicole M.,1.0,3,"Google said this place opens at 1pm on sundays, but they were already taking orders at 12:30 when we arrived. We got our first regular slice around 1, and our square slices at 1:30 - with no line really.. waiting for that first slice wasn't bad but I was ready to lose it waiting for the 2nd Lol. I preferred the square slice much more / could understand the hype for that.  Both had crust/bread that were perfectly crisp. We were really confused why they didn't have a ton of regular and square pies thrown in the oven- it seemed like they made one pie at a time when we were there. Also, you pay after you get all slices which was a nice honor system; however, since we got our 1st and 2nd slices a halfhour apart, I'm sure people get annoyed waiting and walk away without paying for their first if they order multiple slices. Don't expect ambiance, super casual few tables and more of a eat on the street corner kinda place, but highly recommend getting there around opening time and getting that square slice!!",6/23/2019,150,281,994,NZRWlKoopUUmv2AtA_6kJQ
4,Stephanie L.,1.0,4,"My boyfriend and I came by on a Saturday around noon, and surprisingly there was no line! We went inside to order a square pie and round slice and was told it would take about 20 minutes to make the pie. Not too bad of a wait for a fresh pie! Square pie ($34) - Came with 8 slices of deliciousness, sprinkled with pieces of fresh basil. The pizza sauce was definitely fresh... tasted like fresh tomatoes. To me, the sauce was a little more on the tangy side than sweet. I would have liked the cheese to be a little bit more evenly distributed across the pie. There was some parts of the pie with just sauce and no cheese. Round slice ($5) - Same fresh basil, sauce and cheese as the square pie, but with a thinner crispy crust. The cheese was more evenly distributed on my round slice than the pie, which I appreciated! Overall, Di Fara was pretty good. Not my favorite pizza place in NYC (Lucali's still has my heart...) but I believe it's a must try for any pizza lover.",5/31/2019,129,30,45,mJK7bxi2RIkOgRcGTt6QJg
5,Diana P.,1.0,5,"It's delicious ! I swear it's the sauce. I went mid day on a Thursday to avoid the rush and still waited about 20-25 mins for a slice of margarita and cheese pizza. If you feel like you stepped back into the 70s or 80s come here. I personally didn't see the older gentleman there but nonetheless the pizza was good. It was crispy, made with love... you see them rolling the dough, poking it and pouring virgin olive oil right before they cut and serve it. The cleanliness could be MUCH BETTER and a little updating would not hurt. Places like this some ppl want it untouched but they seriously should shut down for a few weeks and bring it into 21st century. Should not affect the quality of the pizza right?!? Right. Back to the pizza...If it's a group order a pie, it looks like it's well worth it. I would definitely come back. Just not going back during rush hour$5 a slice i believe$30 for an entire pie",5/10/2019,207,48,24,s-7p2dvNOAVs-foSLag82Q
6,Morlene C.,0.0,5,"Di Fara Pizza has gone through a paradigm shift in the last couple of years. For the longest time--for over half a century in fact-- Dom Demarco insisted on making every individual pie himself. For so long he wouldn't even let his three adult children who work in the pizzeria and grew up helping him at the shop make a pie. The man likes to have control. And the pizza's great, so who's to blame him?In the last year or so he's finally allowed his children to step in and make some pies. He's expanded to Williamsburg. Di Fara is on Uber Eats! Who could've imagined a world in which you could order Di Fara on an app?In the pre-Uber Eats days part of the experience of going to Di Fara was to wait several hours in line and watch Dom painstakingly pick individual basil from a windowsill flower box and cut the leaves over the pie with a pair of scissors. He took his time. When he grew tired, he'd sit down and no pies were made in the interim. When he got sick, he closed the pizzeria. Dom is not exactly a capitalist.The slice is one of the best in town. You can smell the freshness of the olive oil and basil. The buffalo mozzarella is thick and almost pillowy, sitting atop a layer of piquant San Marzano tomato sauce. The bread is nice and crisp at the bottom, with a pleasant hint of salt. I love salt.Though they've made it more convenient than ever to try their pies via delivery, I say it's worth the in person visit to the Midwood location. Dom has retired, but maybe if you're lucky you can catch a glimpse of a Brooklyn Legend.",7/4/2019,407,39,342,VLTBPUrbNRR-f84h-altQw
7,Dona F.,1.0,3,"I gave this pizza place 3 stars , not that the pizza isn't good- it's very good- but no justification for $5 a slice.  I used to come here when it was $3 and I thought it was a lot then. Dominick is the owner and reminds me of Dom D'Louise when he walked with baby steps in his skit with Carol Burnet. He makes one pie at a time painstakingly slow. He grows basil on the window sill and cuts from there for the pies which is a nice touch. The wait is out the door. Sorry but when I crave pizza I need it NOW not in an hour!! Place is dirty.  Update - board of health has closed them 3 days ago for evidence of live mice. This is the second or third time.",5/20/2019Updated review,31,247,770,rMgKJHpA0kyU8fUk-Ef0NQ
8,Amanda D.,1.0,5,"Prepare yourself - either you will have to wait up to an hour for freshly baked pizza or it'll be so packed you won't even get the chance to wait and will have to come back again on another day. If you do get the chance to wait, it's well worth the wait. Yes, you will see an 80 year old Italian man making your pizza at his own pace. Don't rush him, please. It does take about 30 minutes for him to make each pie, so be prepared to wait.Once out of the oven, it has got to be the best NYC pizza I've ever had in my life. I'm not sure if it's the fact the old man is still making the pizza with love or just the ingredients are all so fresh. We ordered the DiFara classic, which comes with sausages, peepers, and onions. The pie was a masterpiece. The crust was thin, without it being too thin. The pie had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Basil was garnished on top, and was the highlight of the pie, in my opinion.If you have the time to wait, I would suggest you do so.",4/26/2019Previous review,383,304,95,my2T74Ifjz0eR_RE1Neb4A
9,Marco M.,1.0,5,Excellent slice. Only cheese was available because of a party. The first slice we shared was very good. We went back for another and it was even better. More well done and crispy. Comes with a bit of grated Parmesan and basil. Third stop on our pizza crawl - best sauce so far - assertive and spicy. Yum.,3/2/2019,238,1149,2592,_eJ9pXiPKoObEWpI2MmlqA

12,Ariel R.,0.0,1,"KITCHEN NIGHTMARE. Worst restaurant experience and very disappointing pizza. I don't usually write reviews but this was so bad that I have to say something. I came for the first time on a Sunday evening at 6:15 pm with my in-laws who are in town. We ordered a regular pie with pepperoni from the two guys working the ovens. These guys were really nice, and very busy. We ended up waiting for 2.5 hours for this pizza while being strung along that it would be out soon. Only one of their four ovens still works so they can only make a few pizza's at a time. At about 8 PM the daughter started working the front. She was clearly drunk and was fighting with the two guys making the pizzas. They would yell then go to the back and yell some more all in front of us customers. She eventually kicked out the one guy who had a handle on what was actually going on. After this people started to get annoyed because we had all been waiting 2+ hours. The woman working was now getting into yelling matches with customers who were simply asking about their orders. After 2.5 hours I was able to find my order which she had mistakenly put under a different name. While trying to pay for my pizza the woman got so angry (for no logical reason) that she kicked us all out of the store. I was NOT going to leave my pizza so I grabbed it, and the one remaining guy working said to just give him $20 because he was clearly embarrassed about the woman's illogical rant and behavior. Fortunately I was able to escape with the pie right as the pinnacle of the melt-down happened. We were all in shock about what was going on and how the woman was treating her employees and the customers. The worst part was that after all that wait the pizza ended up being marginal at best. The pizza had been over cooked and ended up sitting out for a bit while the woman went on her rant. The center of the pie was very soggy and the crust was hard and stale. You couldn't fold the pizza to eat it because the crust was so hard. I would never ever go back to this place again nor can I understand why it was so busy to begin with. Clearly this place used to make good food but those days are long gone. Everyone else that waited with us had the same feedback. Amazingly terrible experience.",7/7/2019,0,2,0,ScUogWwU3xoW8PRDNOAhSg

14,Eric L.,0.0,1,"Di Fara went to being my favorite pizza spot, to my least favorite overnight. I ordered a pizza pie but instead received a whole burnt nasty pie with the center missing and paper thin slices. In addition the box had a written apology, for the huge hole in the pie with an extra slice on the side. In my opinion this was not only rude, but also unprofessional. The right thing to do, would've been making a new pie the proper way to satisfy your customer.

It's not pretty, even though his daughters are, and sometimes it's smoky from the square pies, and it's always hot, and crowded, but the pizza is worth waiting for.

18,Corinna Y.,1.0,3,"I've always past by years ago in high school, and finally decided to try out this famous pizza place that everyone raves about. I came by on an extremely cold Saturday, and the line was long as expected. It took 15 minutes to get in and order a slice, and 30ish minutes to get the actual slice. At least it was fresh and hot once my friend and I got it. As much as I would like to say that this pizza was as great as people say, I was honestly disappointed. The only great thing about it was that the tomato sauce tasted very fresh and sweet, it is certainly different from an average joe pizza. But the slice itself barely had any cheese and tomato sauce on it, most of what tasted like thin crusted bread. It ended up tasting like your average NYC dollar slice pizza. I'm practically dumbfounded and confused as to why it is hyped so much, maybe getting the square slices or a whole pie is better than the slice???Anyways, I might try it again, but with the ridiculous wait time probably never.",7/15/2019,206,49,22,OGsqbjcBG2U1_rxx7Amarw

There is no pre-made slice, there are no day-old pies. Everything is made to order.The dough is a masterpiece; it's thin, it's crunchy, it has a soft springy interior texture at the edge, it has the gorgeous browned spots that add that slight bitter caramelized flavor.The sauce is exquisite; silky, sweet, tangy, and placed with exactly the right amount to not drown the dough and provide a substrate for the cheese and toppingsThe cheese; only the finest buffalo mozzarella, and not so much that it becomes a grease fest or huge mouthfuls of gluey cheese.And when the entire masterpiece comes out of the oven, it's hit with olive oil and fresh basil.Yes please.",6/23/2019,0,10,0,UbldLdKfuwVNYcUb8mkTCg

Concept we show up to a window and say 2 slices of regular and 2 slices of square and wait. There were not many people there, they cook every pie fresh and only 1 pie at a time. Which was really upsetting because you know you're about to sell 100 slices of regular and square, lets use the other 4 ovens you have and put pies in each of them. Nope. So we get our regular slices about 20 min of waiting. We could of walked away without paying because they are so lax there. We didn't we stayed, another 45 minutes before the square slices showed up.

24,Edward W.,1.0,4,"We came here right when it opened at 12pm on a weekend and there wasn't much of a line. We waited about 30 mins for our pizza. We ordered two pizzas, one square pie and one classic pie. The square classic is by far the superior pizza here. Square classic is a margherita pizza and has a delicious thicker, firm bottom and crust. The fresh basil was definitely a highlight on the margherita. Classic pie had a fairly bland crust and the toppings didn't really go well with each other. It was worth the journey out here just to try it, but there is plenty of pizza closer to Manhattan. I definitely regret trying the classic pie at all, we really should have just doubled down on the square pie.",12/8/2018,420,1571,3021,P4Td3m5oMGZGTfDVZzgztg

27,Alan N.,1.0,4,"New Yorker my whole life and I finally came to Dr Fara for the first time today. A lot of mixed feelings. It is GREAT pizza but coming here is an experience. For those interested in knowing the wait time: I arrived at 1135am Saturday morning and there were 8 people in front of me. I was the 3rd group to order. I didn't get my pizza until 1255pm. So its a decent wait even when I was so close to the front of the line. They're definitely working as fast as they can but its definitely a slow slow process. Definitely they should find a way to be more efficient and organize a bit better. I felt like I was the third person to order... it shouldn't have taken 50 minutes to get my pizza. The pizza itself is really good. I got the DiFara classic. Don't get me wrong, its really good pizza (8.3 on the one bite scale), but it was definitely missing the WOW factor. It took me over an hour each way to get there, 1.5 hour wait... so I really wanted the WOW factor... and I can't say it gave me the WOW factor. The ingredient are SUPER fresh and the sauce is as amazing as everyone described. But it just wasn't special..Tip: If you just get a single slice, you definitely won't be waiting as long as I did. It's still a decent wait... but won't be over an hour wait. General note, if the owners are reading this. Please wear gloves. People were touching everything you can imagine (including the money) and then touching the pizza. I don't really care but its definitely poor food service etiquette. Also a bit disappointing, the old grandpa wasn't there. It seems like he's working less and less now. So if you're lucky enough, he might make an appearance. To summarize, its great pizza. But for $34, deep in Brooklyn, and 1.5 hour wait, I can only give this place 4/5 Stars.",7/11/2019,317,335,1477,xl9Rcs-cW9Vt4140HR03nA
28,Dan E.,1.0,5,"When i think about a perfect NY PIE: thin crust, gooey cheese and sweet/herby sauce.  Di Faras is literally the perfect slice. The crust is super thin and crispy.  It creates a great vehicle for the sweet tomato sauce, with chunks of whole tomatoes, and hand sliced buffalo mozzarella.  The cheese melts beautifully on top of the sauce and dough.It is often stated that one can't rush perfection.  Di Fara's slice is no exception.  The wait time, early in evening before the dinner rush, was about 30 mins for the pie.  The wait will be considerably longer on the weekends and closer to dinner time.The price point is a little high for Pizza.  At approximately $30 a pie, it is almost double the price of my neighborhood pizza spot.   But I always stop here when I am in Midwood, because this is one of the best, certainly top 5, slices in New York.",10/20/2018,222,68,44,3YdU0NNc_nTfssCtdyV-bA
29,Ceylan T.,1.0,4,"I finally had an opportunity to try pizza from this place.  I was excited as I'm a sucker for old school establishments that have a history.  I had it bookmarked as it's one of New York's best spots to grab a slice of pizza.    I was worried that there would be a long line as I had been warned by others that a line was consistently always present.  However, to my relief, there was no line on the weekday that I visited and I was ecstatic that I would be able to finally try their pizza.  It isn't exactly a cheap slice, but you're forking over for an institution that has been here quite a while and hand made by the man himself.  The inside looks like a health hazard, but the walls make up for it by displaying articles that glorify the place.  The pizza was good, however, being a newbie to the thin crust style, I had had to remind myself this was an old school classic.  It might take some getting used to for me, but four stars for the combination of the hype of the establishment and their pizza.",10/18/2018,196,346,2228,XCpqR8MR4gc3CN3iyw4c1Q

31,Jen J.,0.0,3,"I came here on a recommendation/based on all the articles that I've read. I went on a Sunday in May. It was pouring rain outside/super cold and they were supposed to open at 1 PM, but made us stand outside in the rain and did not open the doors until nearly 1:40 PM. I was the 2nd person of the day to order. I ordered a regular slice of pepperoni and sausage and a square slice of sausage and extra cheese. As the other reviews say, I waited about an hour for my first slice. I figured that would be the total wait, but I waited an additional 45 minutes for my second slice. I left after 3:00 PM after arriving at 1:00 for two slices of pizza. They have awards up all over, mainly from 2007 and prior. The pizza was good, but the situation surrounding it and the extremely long wait did NOT make it worth the time. Someone also tried to tell me that it was slow because the owner/elderly man was making the food, but it was actually a bunch of folks in their 20s. If I had to review the pizza only, I'd give it a solid 4 stars, but being a cash only place that makes you wait not only in the rain because they chose to open late, but also so long for two slices of pizza...definitely not worth it in my opinion.

I got there at 1130 of course they don't open till noon. I waited in line behind only like 5 people no biggie. BUT let me tell you Brooklyn is a fucking disgusting armpit mess of shit. Nothing but homeless begging, Hassidics yelling and people being fucking nasty everywhere. I couldn't wait to get the hell outta there. I waited and got my 2 slices.

Of course my ride was ready the fucking minute I got the pizza so I could only take one bite and had to run but I finally got to eat them and the were really damn good. I actually liked them better than Frank Pepe in CT. They are super oily but I loved it anyway. Place is tiny tiny and its old school. The old man wasn't there but I believe his son was. They were super nice and kind and it was 5$ a slice which is insane buy you are in a touristy place. I dug it one more thing to cross off my bucket list.

I got a square slice with pepperoni, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. The sun dried tomatoes and pepperoni were yummy and large in size. The pizza is great, but the crust was a little too hard.

You won't get your average Round pie, neither will you get your average sqaure pie. On top of that, it will take you a long long time to get this pie. So if you are prepared to wait, be crammed, burn the roof of your tongue (I was too excited) then you might be ready to have my absolute favorite pie in NY.",7/5/2019,2,44,95,8UB6mwNz-gZycbdwIwswNw
37,Steven B.,1.0,4,"Made the trek to Brooklyn on a muggy September Wednesday around 2pm. I was pleased to find that there was no line for Di Fara at this particular time on this particular day. The famous Dom was not working today either as he had the day off. I'm not sure, what if any, effect this has on the pizza.I was hungry and would be remiss not to get a slice of the regular and a square style slice.The regular slice is a NYC style. Fresh Basil. Nice crunch on bottom. Moderate chew. Red sauce is good, but I'd like more of it. Not too greasy. Light dough, mild yeast flavor. It seems like they are using low moisture mozzarella, with maybe a sprinkle of Parmesan. No cheese slip! A very solid NYC style slice, one of the best for sure. The combination of rich cheese, fragrant basil and sweet tangy, slightly savory red sauce is addicting. My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more sauce on this slice. Now on that note, the square slice is absolutely loaded with a deep red sauce. Extremely rustic and savory sauce. Nice complexity from the charring on the bottom. The middle part of the slice was soggy and caved in from the weight of the sauce. Pulpy bits of tomato. Low moisture mozzarella topped with more sauce. The flavor of the cheese mostly gets lost under the sauce, so If you are a sauce lover like me this may be up your alley. I did find the flavor of the dough itself to be lacking. I'm mostly getting the interplay of the sauce and the charring on the crust. I don't think this slice is for everyone. My only complaint is that I would have liked a dough that was more flavorful and did not get soggy from the sauce. Di Fara is just shy of a 5/5 for me. The regular slice is about as good as it gets for NYC style. I just would have liked a little more sauce.However, the square slice was lacking on structural integrity and the dough flavor. But the flavor of the sauce is deep and extremely savory like no other sauce I've had.I give Di Fara a solid recommendation, worth a detour. Make a journey there at your own discretion.",3/10/2019,30,177,1047,nJRC9BUXSho8BnplaoClBA
38,Dennis R.,0.0,5,"Simply the best pizza I have ever eaten, bar none. The crust is thin, crispy and holds up the contents. Di Fara's sauce and cheese can't be beat. The fresh basil on top is the perfect finishing touch.",9/14/2018,3,4,0,YfyBMUQoUcz1nGTMMpY4tw
39,Yael D.,0.0,4,"I have a couple hardcore lifetime New Yorker friends who grew up in Midwood, with Di Fara as their neighborhood pizza spot. Legend has it, according to them, that it was totally painless to walk in and grab a slice back then. So hard to imagine.   As for me, I can still picture exacting owner, Dom, lovingly drizzling imported Italian EVOO on each and every pie as it came out of the oven, toe-tapping customers be damned.  Back when I first began coming here, the wait was vaguely torturous, but bearable.  Then the masses discovered it, which translated into higher prices and worse, an interminable wait that made me stay away. For a looong time. Recently, forces seemed to conspire to send me back.  Dom was nowhere to be seen. His kids seemed to be running the show. The place wasn't that crowded, so naively, I figured the wait wouldn't be too bad. Oh, how wrong I was. At least 30 minutes after I ordered... Just when I was about to lose my sh*t, I got my slice.  Now, I gotta say...  It was good!  The crisp, airy crust was different than the ultra-floppy, thinner, charred-on-the-bottom one I remember from Dom's heyday, but it was lovely in its own right.  And the topping boasted vibrant, distinct flavors and plenty of fragrant fresh basil.Ultimately, though, part of the alleged charm of making a pilgrimage here was always about watching the pizza empresario himself in action. That era definitely seems over. And while my slice was good, it was not all that waiting worth of good. There is definitely comparable pizza in NYC these days without the absurd time commitment. Returning here after such a long hiatus gave me that sense of closure we all innately long for. I now know what I've been missing and can move forward.  Yes, of course am talking about pizza. What did you think I was referring to (wink)?ps If you're interested in trying a square slice, the wait is even longer than for the regular. All I can say is, heaven help you.",7/8/2019,136,578,1907,PUDYBk_OW3dYQFNhGPaRjQ
40,Dasle K.,1.0,5,"Di Fara has been on my bucket list for years, and I'm happy to report that I FINALLY had the chance to make the trip here.Di Fara now has a second location at the North 3rd Street Market in Williamsburg, but we opted for the full experience at the original location. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon, so we got lucky with almost no line. The only wait was for the pizza itself (40-45 min). We ordered half original, and half Di Fara Classic (peppers, sausage, onions, and mushrooms). Both were sooooo good. But if I had to choose I think I liked the Di Fara Classic better. A few tips:- Cash only.- There really isn't much to do in the area while you wait, so make sure to come with someone who you can talk to for hours. - Consume on the spot; but it's still good when you get home. - Be prepared to wait at minimum 45 min. - DeMarco is 84 and may retire one day. GO before it's too late. The pizza here was solid by all standards, but was it a game-changer? To be honest, no. I'm still a fan of John's on Bleecker, Lucali in Brooklyn, and so many other pizza spots that we in NYC are blessed with. But 54 years of pizza making is both an art and a science. Di Fara is consistently ranked for the best pizza in NYC (and America) and I think there's something really special about the whole counter pizza experience, and about DeMarco himself. I'm very grateful that I had an opportunity to witness the pizza master at work. I hope you get the chance too.",8/19/2018,724,287,2048,Z04BoxuWChF17meyN_e33w

42,Charles R.,1.0,2,"Di Fara's, I respect your tradition but I can't call your Pizza ""Pizza."" Burnt pieces of toast with evaporated tomato sauce and a sprinkle of cheese don't qualify as Pizza in my book.We came at 12:18, 40 minutes before their 1:00pm open only to have to wait an additional 25+ minutes for them to open. Upon entering, there was a cockroach twitching on the ground centimeters from the front door, but we were willing to overlook that in anticipation of some ""delicious"" authentic Pizza. After all, what NY restaurant hasn't dealt with pest issues?But I find myself mentioning it here now because it is not only that we were greeted by a roach, but also that we were stiffed $20+ dollars for four slices of burnt toast. I would understand the purpose of burning the bread if it became caramelized, but this certainly was not. It was dry and tasted like stale bread.It is hyped up places like Di Fara that make me think the reviewers at Zagat and NYTimes get bored and try to look for restaurants with sweet stories. Yes, I agree: it would be so great if this super out of the way, sweet old man in an old Pizza shop, using fresh ingredients, slowly churning out slice after slice made delicious Pizza. But he doesn't. People like to eat food with a backstory and the reviewers know that: they take advantage of that to write compelling stories.People confuse age with quality and that presents a problem. Just because a restaurant has been grandfathered into a neighborhood, does not mean it is good. These reviewers make long write-ups and people buy into the hype. All the praise sung by article after article, people then look for. They seek out these elements so lovingly written about in the paper. They romanticize to the point where they aren't tasting the Pizza, but instead riding on the freshness of the ingredients alone to justify spending so much. They want to be inspired, understandably so. We all seek out inspiration in our food, but the skeptic and strong-minded can look past the hype and can call a bad meal when they have one, and that was a bad meal.",8/19/2018,22,156,252,x2nzlW8_Q66EVmW2fnijHg

44,Charlie P.,0.0,1,"A lot of trouble for a slice.One star only because the six times I've tried to eat there, I haven't actually been able to get my hands on the holy grail of Brooklyn pizza. It's pretty fussy for a no frills hole in the wall. Long, long lines at all times. I was told the wait would be at least three hours on a week day afternoon for sit down and takeout. We were expected to wait in arundown hybrid coffee shop and storage room around the corner without leaving a phone number.Maybe the hype has gone to their heads or they can't keep up with the demand (or don't want to which is totally understandable). Keep it small and the quality exceptional. I won't give up, but maybe we aren't a good fit. I'll update when Di Fara graces me with an actual slice of pizza.

45,Bradley R.,0.0,1,"Honest opinion? Based on pizza not made by Dom the old man.Nothing great. As a matter of fact, note the cheese on the square slices (7 bucks each) is melting off the slice. Its barely cooked. Like an after thought. The regular pie had better cooked cheese but my mouth is on fire right now. I believe they add red pepper flakes to the sauce.Crunch thin (thinner in some places) crust was good.Basil was fresh and thankfully not cut with an old scissor (which is Doms schtick).Pie was $30. 2 slices of pepperoni square was $14. $44 for this is a tragedy.Lucky for a Saturday, i was able to grubhub it and wait for 5 minutes when i arrived. There are (crazy) people who wait 2....hours for this. They stand there (or sit) for 2 hours. Get a life people.This is an example of mass hysteria. No one wants to be ""that guy"" say its mediocre at best. Everyone wants to fit in with the crowd.I give this a 3.5 out of ten.",1/26/2019,348,61,141,2leYLZ_LnhbBQFWS56PNhA
46,Sally Z.,1.0,4,"I might be making some people mad with this review, but my overall experience was not great, minus the 5 minutes I was inhaling the pizza because I was so hungry at that point. Went on a Saturday around noon. Our friend went 20 minutes before they opened and there was a line already! He ordered a pie for us. We ended up getting our pizza about 2 hours later. Didn't really understand the system but lots of people who ordered after us got their pizza first, maybe because they ordered slices and not whole pies. Who knows. In addition to the extraordinarily long wait, it was about 90 degrees with 80% humidity and the restaurant portion was not open! They were only taking window orders. Meaning nowhere to sit and wait and nowhere to eat. Again, not sure if this is like a weekend thing or something, but really didn't think it was good for business. Guess it doesn't matter to them, they will always have business anyway!The pizza itself was very very good. But it was not mindblowing. I think I had hyped it up so much in my mind after hearing and reading and seeing so much about it, I was a bit dismayed. By no means was it BAD, but it wasn't extremely memorable. It was just very good, and I can't say anything was bad about it. The cheese was a melty 800 degrees, just like  the oven it was cooked in, the basil was fresh, the crust was thin, the sauce was well proportioned. Delicious. That first bite though. I would love to go back and try the square! I'm bummed we didn't go on a day that the son was making pizzas. Apparently, only his son makes the squares and he doesn't work on weekends. So I guess I will have to go back!And regardless of all of this, I really respect DeMarco for making each pizza by hand at the age of 81.

47,Holly W.,1.0,4,"It was a rainy late December day.  Di Fara's has been on my Cousins bucket list so we head there!  Quick review:- Bring cash (prices are not listed but keep in mind it's $30 for a pizza and $5/6 for a slice)- Expect to wait awhile (also nowhere in the neighbor hood to really wander around on a Friday afternoon since you're in a Hacidic area)- Go square!For those who need more info:I have to say there has to be a better process.  First you wait in line at a window they don't actually use to take orders but the old pizza box sign hanging on a bungee cord crossing the door to get in tells you to stand in line.  *While you are waiting don't get worried you are doing the wrong thing seeing everyone coming and going inside or walking with pizza out back (apparently you can take in there to eat.)  They have already ordered and are just picking up.  We were in line for about 40 minutes before someone approached walking up and down taking our order in a notebook.  We ordered one large Sopressata pizza and 2 slices of cheese pizza.  We were told at least an hour (no precise answer there.)We re-entered past the bungee box sign after 40 minutes.  We continued to wait with at least 30 other people.  We waited about another 40 minutes for our whole pizza. While we waited a square pizza overcooked a little and they cut it up and offered it to the waiting patrons.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  Just cheese but yummy! I can say from waiting I did learn they have their own writing/order system I quite enjoyed trying to figure out and I saw the little pieces of sopressata torn up added to our pizza after it had already cooked for a little bit.  Also, I saw how they made their pizza's.  When they come out of the oven they cut a ton of fresh basil and garlic oil in a pretty spiral.  They do put the extra touches on to make it 'theirs.'  When our whole pizza was done, it sat there in front of us but we couldn't eat as the cheese pizza slices for my daughter hadn't even been put in the oven yet!  Little disappointing as for how long we waited. About 15 minutes later we had our full order. We could eat!  So, by tearing up the sopressata... you had no idea what bite had it or didn't which I loved!  It was very tasty... but not tasty enough to want to wait as long as we did again for pizza!  My daughter being a 7 year old disliked all the basil and I had to pick a lot of her 2 slices.Overall we did it!  And I do want their square pizza again...",1/11/2019,27,370,463,eBrVkzHhHKZxyVS1SPKbJw
48,florina a.,1.0,5,"I grew up on this pizza. Through decades, it has remained consistently amazing. It's now $5 per slice but worth every penny. They use he freshest ingredients, the best quality and generously cut the size. I can't say enough good things about this pizza!If you don't like Parmesan cheese, you ask them to not sprinkle it on top (which they do by default). They also add fresh basil on top. Get a regular slice, you won't regret it! Or come with a group and share a pie. You can call and order ahead and avoid the line by picking up from the window and taking it to go.

I paid a visit at 3pm on a Thursday with no wait at all! I got two slices. Both were very greasy which I love and there's a nice touch of crumbled cheese on top. The basil is a nice add but I could barely taste it. The tomatoes were juicy but didn't bring any flavor. And the crust was awfully dry. I'm not sure why I even had the crust. I was in pain and near death from the dryness! What really worked were the chili peppers. There's a container of them near the register and they definitely elevated the pizza. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, this is average, or even below average. Given that this was out of the way, I don't see myself coming back. I would've hated to have waited nearly 2 hours for this pizza which many have done. I still recommend giving this spot a try. Just don't go around noon.",10/5/2018,347,82,386,507fvG45uz-AGF2umZqVdg

We walk in and the woman said they're short staffed so it's a pick between a square pie or round pie- NO toppings. We have heard so many great things about Di Fara Pizza so we figured it was worth whatever wait Yelpers have said. We waited a total of 2 HOURS just to get the actual pizza not even eating time included!!!! We understand everything is made fresh the moment of but it was just 1 plain round pie. Anyone that came in were orderly and polite but the woman seemed so frazzled and would say each order was a 40-45 minute wait. FOR PLAIN CHEESE PIZZA. In reality, every person had to wait about 1.5-2 hours. Can you imagine how long they take with toppings OR delivery?!?! Luckily we were able to secure a 2 seater spot in the front by the window so we ate comfortably but I'd honestly never make my way here again even if I lived around the corner. The pizza wasn't even that great. I mean we were starving so it tasted good but it was so thin. Too thin for $30. We've had plenty of good pizza in Staten Island and NJ; not worth the wait time.

61,Nobel V.,0.0,4,"Di Fara, a place that has been a staple for years.  I definitely think this place is good due to the nostalgia as it has been around for such a long time.  Dom is still making the pizzas and I will be taking advantage of that as long as it is still happening :)Anyways, yes the prices are a little high but I do enjoy their pizza.  The think crisp slices hit the spot for me.  I also add their chili oil (and some chilis too for a good kick).  With Dom making the pies though, a line definitely will develop during peak times which can sway away people (especially if people end up getting many slices or pies).  If you like the crisp thin-style pizza and can take the spicy chili oil, then I say give this pizza a shot (if you somehow have not been here yet!)The place is small, and it is cash only, so be ready!",11/25/2018,1011,315,1318,dAr6e-x6izK_Pi5OFAqiIg
62,Billy M.,1.0,5,I think Di Fara is some of the best pizza in Brooklyn next to spumoni gardens and Lucali they have a great square slice. It's cooked till it's crispy the lines can be long during peak hours I love the pride the owner takes in making his pizzas that goes to show quality over quantity.

64,Maria E.,0.0,5,"In the five boroughs of New York City, by far my most favorite pizza spot is........ Di Fara.Located deeeeep in Brooklyn, right off the Avenue J spot on the Q, Di Fara is well worth the wait. I've been here about 5 times before (twice visiting New York and another 3 times while living here) and it doesn't get old. Honestly, I would be here every other week, but it's about an hour subway ride from my place then another hour or so of waiting for the pizza. STILL worth the way, but not for every week.I don't know how to describe how it's so different... Maybe because this little old man that single handedly makes every pie with his bare hands (takes it out of the oven without mits!) all day. Fresh ingredients, I'm pretty sure he makes everything in house. At the age of 83, this man has dedicated his life to making ""pizza pies"" as my father calls them. yes I did order 2 whole pies. One grandma style and the other a regular pepperoni marghertia. Usually I'm a square pie kind of girl, but I have to say that I actually liked the round pie better.The ingredients are fresh. That sauce is so good and the hand ripped basil is just the best. I don't know what it is about this place. Maybe it's because I can feel how much love he puts into every pie. It's just amazing. Hands down, my favorite pizza in all of the 5 boroughs!MC",6/16/2019,22,64,99,tCMMycmIg65tlPMTpaS5cA
65,Tommy O.,1.0,4,"Di Fara is known for some of the best pizza in NYC by every major food publication. I'm from Chicago so I had to compare some of the best pizzas in NYC to Chicago. My buddy and I visited Di Fara on a Saturday around 1pm over Memorial Day Weekend to kill some time before check in. I walked in and the place is very small. It can probably fit about 30-40 people, but that would be extremely crowded. If the place is packed, I would recommend buying a pizza to go as there are only about 20 seats. We were able to order within about 10 minutes and then it took about 20 minutes for the pizza to be ready. So as long as you come during off hours, the wait times are not that bad. The ordering system is a first come first serve so make sure no one cuts in front of you because there isn't really a line. Di Fara is also cash only and they offer thin crust and square slices. They serve pizza by the slice ($5) and whole pies ($28-$34). We ordered the Classic Pie, which comes with sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The pie came out blistering hot as it was just fresh out of the oven. The toppings were the freshest toppings that I have ever had. The red/orange peppers were still crunchy when I ate them, which I have never had happen before. The cheese was tasty and the basil was so good! The only con that I had was that the crust was slightly burnt on the bottom. But other than that, the pizza was amazing!Food was about 4.5. I gave the review a 4 because the place is cash only, not much seating, and the long wait times. If you are looking for an amazing slice of pizza, then Di Fara is a great place to try!",6/10/2018,165,165,290,xFecfpI9Klvgrrre0W6BtQ

Oh jo, running out of sausage by 4pm on Sunday. :( Pie after pie coming out made by the 2 guys, each one more charred then the other. Why buy quality ingredients and then have the flavor ruin  with burnt crust? When you bite into it, the burnt crust is on top of the tongue and that is all you taste, burnt flavor. Oh Dom, your legend is there but fading.",1/13/2019,4,106,502,qvbkSFpcs465fMa6mVvcjg
67,Christine G.,1.0,2,"It had been a few years since my last visit to Di Fara. At that time, it was excellent and set a very high bar. As a native to the New York area, I have high standards for pizza and wanted to revisit one of the ""greats"" again on a recent visit home. This time, I'd give the pizza 3 stars and the experience 2 stars. We arrived around 2pm on a Friday, hopeful to have missed the ""lunch rush"". Every other tourist visiting NYC that day must have had the same idea, because a small crowd was waiting to order. We waited a few minutes to place our order for 2 slices. Once we ordered, we stood around outside for another 30 minutes or so (in the rain) before the interior crowd freed up enough that we could stand inside and wait. We stood waiting inside for another hour or so in the hot, crowded space, until my boyfriend grabbed a table where we sat and waited for another 30 minutes.Yep. We waited over 2 hours for 2 slices of pizza! While we waited, we had plenty of time to observe the pizza making system. Orders are produced in the order they are received to ensure maximum freshness. This means that if you want just one slice, you have to wait for everyone who ordered full pizzas ahead of you to have their pie made, and then for enough slice orders from the list to accumulate to make a slice pie. The entire operation is staffed by 2 very kind, hardworking people who are doing their best, but simply cannot tackle the volume efficiently with their method. If a slice could be produced at half this pace, I'd be willing to chalk this up to ""quaint family business pace"" but it was simply too long. People grew frustrated and abandoned their orders, which meant customized pizzas that could not be readily reused for other customers either went to waste (as did the time it took to make the pizza) or were accepted by people who hadn't ordered that but wanted to stop waiting. Based on the system I'd say you're better off ordering a pie than a slice. Once we did get our slices, they were just okay. My boyfriend got the round slice, which he liked (but didn't LOVE enough to justify the wait). I got the square slice, which was, after all the effort made to serve it hot, lukewarm, and burnt on the bottom. The ingredients were high-quality and fresh, but it was not the life-changing perfection I remember from years past.Overall, save yourself a long subway ride and hours of waiting: there are many other excellent pizza options in NYC.",1/6/2019,197,301,48,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw

69,Tatiana D.,1.0,5,"I saw this place on ""Munchies"" and on ""Somebody Feeds Phil."" I figured I had to try it since it's so popular. Wow, I am glad I did! I spent $30 on a whole pie, usually I would cringe for spending that much just on a pie, but OH MY HOLY REALIZATION! I was not upset at all! This pie was soooo good! Every time I took a bite and the fresh basil landed on my tongue, I just drooled. It was so good. My husband and I kept talking about how good the pizza was every time we grabbed a new slice, and then next thing you know, we finished the whole pie. I still can't grasp why it was soo good! It was such a simple pie, and yet, my mouth was watering at every bite. We just got the basic pie, which was included cheese and basil on top. Also, we went later in the evening when it was dark so we weren't sure if the place was closed or not because the lights were so dim. We just decided to try to open the door anyways since online it said they were open. So, if you go at night, and it seems like they're closed because of dim lighting, just go in, they should still be open. I have to say that this place is definitely deep in Brooklyn. So, if you're coming from Manhattan or Queens, be prepared for a travel. I think it took us maybe 30 to 40 minutes through the subway to get here. When we ordered our pie, it was not crowded at all, which I was so happy because I heard how people can wait up to 35 to 45 minutes just for their pie when it's busy. Luckily, our pie came out in 15 minutes tops! I was honestly tempted to buy another pie because it was so darn good! The pleasure of having Dom be the one to make our pie was not in our favor. He wasn't in. I did find out though that he comes in on Fridays and I think on Sundays during the day time. Please try this place out if you stop by Brooklyn!

70,Gab G.,1.0,4,"Came with two people the day before Thanksgiving and there was no wait. Wasn't impressed by the square slice - it had clearly been out for a while and was pretty dry - but that was just a snack to eat while we waited for a full Classic pie. The decor is outdated and there's no bathroom, but this was not a problem, as once our pizza was ready, we devoured it in record time. Definitely a bit pricey, but so worth it.

71,Jeannette N.,1.0,4,"I was fully prepared to wait an hour for a slice of pizza, but I got one as soon as I walked in! What are the odds! Maybe because it was memorial day weekend and a very hot day, but I certainly wasn't complaining. As for the slice itself, well of course I had insanely high expectations considering Di Fara is consistently rated the #1 pizza in New York, and I can say without a doubt, I've had better. The tomato sauce is delicious and fresh, good cheese, but I wasn't a huge fan of the crust - it was a tad burnt on the ends. And for $5, I would have expected a bigger slice. Maybe the pizzas are better fresh out of the oven. Mine could have been sitting out for awhile as most people seemed to be ordering whole pies and not slices. Nonetheless, I've got to give Mr. DeMarco props for slinging these pies day in and day out for over 50 years. He clearly puts a lot of love into his work, and despite all the fame and presumed fortune, he's kept his joint small with no frills. I'll have to give it another try sometime soon.",5/27/2018,204,193,783,Xp0gC-xpP7iEKTNXCM6WZw
72,Jose C.,1.0,5,"I originally came here for just a slice. I had already tried a slice from another place and wanted to try a couple through Brooklyn. I didn't want to get full off of just one place. But after I had waited about 45, I decided to just order two slices. The story about my wait here was quite interesting but I won't go into all of that. I will just say the rapper Q Tip was in here buying a couple of pizzas and walked off without me even recognizing him. I was initially offered squares that were available and I had so yes, but I'm glad she never gave them to me. I had noticed one thing...Dom wasn't making the squares. He was making the round pizzas up front and once I noticed that, the round is all I wanted. I'm sure the square slices are good, but I wanted what Dom was making. If you read a lot of reviews from this place, most will say it's not worth the hype or not worth the wait especially at $5 a slice or $32 a pizza. I want people to come here and enjoy it, not for their hype but for the experience. Yes it's pricey for just ""pizza, but you have just one person making the round pizzas, one at a time. If you watch him make this pizza, you can see that he makes it with amore. He uses nothing but imported fresh ingredients from Italy, the sauce and mozzarella and the olive oil he drizzled on the pizzeria before he puts it in the oven. He doesn't need a timer, he opens the oven, and knows when his pizza is ready. Once it's ready, he sprinkles some cheese on top and cuts some fresh basil and mama Mia. A wonderful deliciously made pizza. If you don't care about all that, then maybe Di Faras isn't for you. The pizza is thin, crust was amazing and just right perfect amount of cheese and sauce for this type of pizza. You can really enjoy and taste every ingredient that he puts on this pizza. Very simple ingredients, yet one of the tastiest pizza I've ever had. Next time I'm in town, I will defiantly order a whole pizza, wait the hour or two while taking a walk on the neighborhood.",4/11/2018,454,543,912,XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA

The pizza has the best quality recipe out of any parlor I ran into in the city (We ordered a pie with half pepperoni and cheese) and the customer service was beautiful. As busy and crazy as it gets, every worker was kind and courteous to me. This is probably what I appreciated the most out of Di Fara's. You definitely won't mind tipping them for it. Some things to know:Cash onlyThe place is pretty small but has extra space on the other side of the block. I managed to get a small spot in the venue to sit down and eat but other's weren't so lucky I'd imagine.Be prepared to wait and stand in a crowd.

76,Bob B.,0.0,1,"Dom DiMarco once made some great pizza. Dom was the best...a friggin' genius. BUT NO MORE. He is now over 80 and is retired. His kids now make the pizza and they cannot cook...at all. Dom's kids have inherited NOTHING but a name. They are a disgrace to the memory of a once great pizzeria. I am not exaggerating. I ate at DiFara almost 3 times a week during 2002 or so until 2011. But Dom's kids can't even make pizza in an ordinary acceptable commercial manner...much less in Dom's ultra-superior and unique style. Shame on you Dom to allow this to happen! You should have just closed up and went out with some dignity rather than try to squeeze out the last few dollars off the hype machine.  The ingredients are now just ordinary commercial crap. The crust is a disaster...bad flour heated in a gas oven until dry and brittle. Unevenly cooked. Parts are raw and parts are burnt. Cheap olive oil drenches the whole mess. Truly inedible.  GONE are the great ingredients....GONE is the extreme craft, the hand manicured pies. Gone is Dom.,,,and the pizza is crap and the store is unsanitary. DiFara was always a filthy little place shut down annually by the board of health, but at least the pizza made up for it. Now the pizza matches the environment. It is now just crap....crap, crap, crap. Don't eat here. It saddens me to say that. Dom was great. Hats off to you Dom...but the pizza is now disgusting and insulting to the memory of a great career.

We were given a heads up of roughly how long it was going to be so we were able to kill time nearby rather than waiting in the shop. As Dom (the owner) makes every pie by hand, you're probably in for a wait. Having said this, this was undoubted some of the best pizza I've ever eaten in the United States.We got a square pie, two slices of the regular pizza, and two slices of the classic pizza pie (the slices were going to be ready quicker, so we ate those while waiting for the full pie). Absolutely delicious. If you're going to wait an hour or more for the pie, PLEASE eat in the shop or the car or nearby! So good fresh!",2/22/2019,125,12,13,M8trZJIpQMxHLDInMRbKHA
79,Victor P.,0.0,1,"This place is absolutely disgusting. I don't think they have cleaned it since its grand opening. I used to eat here sparingly in the 90's and the pizza was totally different. It was a good slice if you got it before it sat out all day. Unfortunately, that almost never was the case. The place was always empty and completely dead back then. Fast forward to the early 2000's the owners daughter got into marketing and advertised their little diamond In the rough. This near vacant pizzeria exploded with customers. Now they're cutting fresh basil (with school scissors) for each pie and covering it with parmesan cheese. Touting it as a gourmet slice with an outrageous price. So I gave it a try recently.... (before reading their health violations)Pizza was very oily, a sloppy mess. It wasn't very good.  Im just happy I didn't get sick. I waited over an hour, and was skipped in line by a transplant hipster. So much for being an original Brooklynite. She got her pizza in 15 min I waited over an hour. Forget this place its all marketing and hype. BEWARE the place is so dirty its an actual health hazard.

80,Zeeshan R.,0.0,5,"Yup, it's as good as they say it is. Don't think there's a need for me to hype it up any further, so I'm going to provide some helpful tips.1. Get there early. If you are not the first few people in the door and seated, expect anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours wait. 35-45 mins before opening is a good time to get there.2. Don't order too much!!! Can't stress this enough. In our uncontainable excitement we ordered 4 pies for 6 people but the minute we got our first pie, we realized our mistake and for the rest of our meal we had a lingering uneasiness about what we were going to do with so much pizza. I recommend ordering just enough to satiate yourself without overindulging so you can fully savor and enjoy the complexities of the pizza here.  (Aim for 2-3 slices per person) 3. Don't compare Dom's pizza to any chain restaurants or you're going to be disappointed. This isn't any of that gimmicky, bready, greasy crap you have on a drunken night out.

No Is it worth a 1hr+ weight? Hell no But that being said, if I were in the area, and walked past and saw no line, I wouldn't be opposed to buying a pizza. I just wouldn't go out of my way for it, nor would I wait in line. We shared 2 pizzas between 3 people (had 2 slices to spare at the end):-plain-half pepperoni, half sausage The toppings and the pizza itself were both delicious. The crust was pretty stiff though.... for instance it was a little difficult to bend the slice to eat NY style. We arrived on a weekday @ 11:30, and there was just one person ahead. The line developed about 14 deep by the time it opened @ 12:15 (15min late). However it seemed like every was served very quickly after opening (in fact our plain pizza was already available when we ordered).Not much seating available.

83,Ghali A.,1.0,5,"Maybe we got lucky or maybe I was strategic but I couldn't have asked for a better experience to order, buy, and taste a pizza pie from Di Fara. The stories I've heard and read of people waiting for hours outside in the scorching heat or the pouring rain for a pie (or an effin slice) were almost discouraging and outright pissy since most of the negative reviews are from people who waited hours then criticized the food. I get it. You wait hours, getting agitated and frustrated, cursing the heavens and the pizza Gods, that by the time you get the pie (or if your dumb enough to wait that long for 2 slices rather than throwing down an extra $15 for a whole pie), you're pissed so it tastes like crap to you. By this point, you don't understand the fuss and the buzz and the hype so you judge the pizza - ""this pizza's not worth the wait"", you sloppily thumb-fist into your Yelp profile like a nerd on prom night. You judge the taste of the food by the fact that you chose to wait for it. But guess what homey: I got so lucky, I was enjoying my pie within 15 mins of ordering. That's right, I'm actually boasting about the fact that I waited the same amount of time I would've waited at any corner pizzeria - and that's a big effin deal. On this past Saturday morning, my wife and I decided we'd stop at Di Fara for a pie on our way to meet some friends later in the afternoon. The plan was we'd buy a pie, eat a couple of slices, and save the rest 'cause, you know, we're smart enough to wait for a pie not just a slice. Why wait an hour for a slice when you can grab a pie? Let the wait time match the reward, you dodo. We planned to wait an hour - no more. I didn't wait in lines for an iPhone; I'm not waiting in line for a pizza. There's always next time. We arrived at 2:45p on that beautiful, sun-shining Saturday afternoon and by 3:10p, we were eating our delicious, crispy, tasty $32 pie. No friggin joke! It couldn't have worked out better than if I were to write this storyline. The place is dank, old, small, and grimy but we like that right? It's part of the charm. There were people ordering; there were people waiting; but, luckily (or strategically) there was no infamous, gut-wrenching, flavor-busting, taste-diffusing line. I walked in, walked up, and placed my order like a good NYer. Within 15 mins, I bit into the best slice I've ever eaten. I think I even heard angels sing. It was so crisp but not over cooked. I expected the slice to droop upon folding because it looked greasy but, alas, it did not. The bifold worked. It wasn't greasy, it glistened with flavor. Every bite was a crunch with a punch of robust flavor: the dough tasty; the tomato sauce perfectly balanced the cheese - small chunks of skinless tomato but no acidity added the perfect texture to the thin slice. The cheese was perfect. By the time I got to the crust, which was also amazing and full of flavor, I found myself eating a whole new slice. We killed the pie. Now, maybe I'm exaggerating or maybe I'm not but either way, I only waited 15 minutes so I got to enjoy it more than you. And that makes it worth it, mofo. Here's my tip:- If you're going to wait, don't wait for a slice. Get a pie. Make it count.- Let it cool for 2-3 minutes then devour. Don't eat it right away like an amateur and don't wait 'til you get home, if you live more than 30 mins away, like a moron. - If you absolutely have to take it home, don't put it in the trunk, eff-tard!- AND don't leave a negative review about how underwhelming the pizza was after all the hype because you chose to wait 3 hours like an idiot then drive it home 30-45 mins away.

84,Elizabeth B.,1.0,5,"Yes, getting pizza here is an all-day event. As long as you get in the mood for that, you're all good.An important note: Some Yelp reviews note that you should call ahead to help with the wait. We tried calling, and we got a voicemail saying the wait is over an hour for a slice, and to not leave orders on the voicemail.We arrived at around 4:30 on a Sunday, and the wait was an hour and a half (we ended up waiting two and a half hours). We ordered one regular pie. No worries, we wandered over to The Ox Tavern (about a 15-minute walk) to watch the Eagles game and have a drink before enjoying our pizza.We then sat at their cafe Fatts that has additional seating for customers. We sat at the table outside since it was such a beautiful evening.Yo. That sauce. That olive oil. That fresh basil!!! You read those other reviews correctly - it's the best pizza in New York. Possibly the best New York style pizza in the world. Ask them if you can get their marinated Calabrian chilis if you like things spicy - so much better than just crushed red pepper.The people who work there are also by far the nicest pizza shop employee's I've ever met.

You can definitely taste the perfection of using the best of ingredients from Italy and Isreal... but two hours? For this? I live in Chicago and have had better than this... so what gives? The biggest disappointment of the whole trip? No Dom.A few articles we read said that he makes EVERY single pie and if he isnt able to come in... they close for the day. That I thought was the coolest thing ever... When we asked where he was.... the daughter said... Oh.... Uh..... He's in the back...Whatever.Go to Roberta's or Artichoke.

When you enter you see an old and not very clean pizza spot; it's very disorganized and you don't know where the line starts, your best bet is to as someone and wait for your food which could take 15+ minutes.

I had a lonely square slice that looks like it was sitting there for 5 years.  It was $6 for the slice and a whole pie would have been $34. That's a lot of dough no pun intended so it better live up to the hype. The slice was half heated up so while eating it there were patches of cold spots. The crust was hard throughout the whole slice as well as greasy. I know it wasn't hot out of the oven fresh pie, but if your going to over charge then it better be good. The place itself looks run down which matches up to their pizza. I heard the old man that ran the place made it the best but he retired.

However the square slide had little thicker crust, more tomato sauce, more seasoning, and mozzarella cheese.

A few people in line got sick of waiting and left. Around 12:40 they started taking orders at the window, and shortly after that, let us in. Since I was one of the first in line, I got a seat in the back. Started chatting with a nice local who gave me tons of food recommendations.I waited about 30 min for my 2 slices after that. I ordered a slice, and a square with pepperoni.  Note the people in line behind me that ordered a whole pie got it  and finished it before I got my 2 slices - if you come here and are in a ""hurry"" order a whole pie. I found all the patrons to be friendly and everyone started chatting as they were waiting for their pizza.Come here expecting to wait. If you appropriately temper your expectations you will be okay.The square slice was big and hearty with a lot of sauce. The pepperoni was crispy and good. The dough was crisp on the bottom and doughy on the inside (in the best way possible). The regular slice was nice and thin, and very greasy, but had a great flavor. It tasted very light (despite the grease).Would I come here again? Sure if I friend wanted to come and to wait in line. But I'd likely try somewhere else new on my own.

Was surprised when we saw it on Food Network and all the other foodie shows so had to take the family to eat the best slice in NYC. Tastes the same as it did 25 yrs ago. A very good slice but now its $5. Back again over the summer so we stop by with my sister's family so they can try the best pizza in NYC. We order a pie and when I come in I talk to Dom's daughter since I grew up in the area. Next thing I know the guy working there says my name and he remembers me from 20+ years ago...it's Rob from back in the neighborhood!  And he's been making pizzas there for years now.

104,Franny A.,1.0,3,"Once upon a time there was a neighborhood pizza place on Ave J. It was the lone Italian pizzeria in a sea of kosher pizza spots. It was where we went for a quick slice and it was no better than any good slice growing up in Brooklyn. Dom the owner came from Italy and it was in the late nineties or early 2000's that Dom went back to Italy and brought back new techniques including fresh  basil and the mixing of cheeses. When he first upgraded the pizza he used to have the fresh basil on the counter, that he cut onto the pizza.  A pizza phenomenon was born.When I brought my Jersey friend here Saturday the pizza had changed.The corner joint still original design, unrenovated and unremarkable bordering on dirty as it has been for many years, but previously the pizza redeemed all that- no more.Dom, I'm guessing is no longer at the helm at all and the pizza is very different. We ordered a round and while we waited I watched pie after pie and knew immediately. Still has the hot peppers on the counter covered in aluminum foil. But, when Dom made the pizza after its first reincarnation, , it was thinner crusted , nearly charred with sauce and cheese up to the crust. No more- now thicker without the pillowy delicateness and with more crust- the pizza is good, but far from pizza pilgrimage material,",10/7/2018,877,1342,1194,uWnVvgXhopXEPdEcI2vXrQ

One or two slices got a bit too hard/black underneath, more than I would have liked, but it was still really good. Loved the huge chunks of garlic and fresh cut basil right on top. The pepperoni made it a bit oily but what can ya do. The interior is old and you can tell it's been around forever. Has that neighborhood charm that's irreplaceable.

Finally, I was able to make a quick trip to New York City. We had two and half days and Di Fara was on my ""MUST HAVE"" list. We took a subway and after 11 stops, we finally made it to the neighborhood. Every place there is closed expect for Di Fara. They close pretty early at 8 pm but everything else around closes around 6 pm. Sometimes I forget I'm not in Vegas haha. Anyways we ordered a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and olives. The wait was about an hour and a half, which is understandable because of their popularity.I loved seeing all the awards and recognition around the walls of this little pizza shop. Everything is the way they've been doing it for decades. Dom makes all the pizzas with love and care. We left to go to a bar in the meantime. We came back right at 8 before they closed and three of us killed this pizza in two minutes. We spoke with one of the workers that refers himself at the ""Chinese Guy"" haha. He was very nice and it was nice to hear about the history of the place and how there's so many pizza places that try to copy them. I repeat, this is the only Di Fara in the world and the pizza is unlike anywhere I've ever had. It was delicious! The ingredients tasted fresh and the crust is tasty. I'll definitely come back to Di Fara every time I go to New York. I recommend ordering two pizzas for a group of three. Don't forget to bring cash!

These were no joke the best pepperonis I have ever had. They are super thick and flavorful. Crust was nice, some parts were a little too crispy but that's NY pizza in general.

Got a square slice and a regular slice - coming from L&B right before, we had high standards for a square slice and Di Fara did not disappoint. The crust was harder and crispier than L&B with sauce that's more vibrant and acidic as well. Perfect, fresh basil with quality EVOO really made the difference here. I'd say this was as good as a square slice can get.Regular slice was less impressive for me but still better than my first experience. The cheese, basil, sauce, and EVOO are the highlights here. The crust is very thin with a nice crust, but it has more of a chew than the regular slice, which can be good or bad based on personal preference.All in all, if I'm in the area again, I definitely will be back",9/6/2018,253,602,0,DxsZCsQXTN7vcVUwtGlN9g

I'd tell my friends that I wouldn't mind waiting - it was like a work of art to watch him take the pizza out of the oven with his hands and drizzle the olive oil over the pies. Then he'd gently cut the basil over the slices and cut the pie so it's ready. I couldn't wait to have this fresh home-made pizza that I felt my grandpa made. I hadn't been back to Di Fara in a bit and was nostalgic for a real slice. I went in and was heartbroken to know that Dom is now retired. His kids are now running shop, and although the line wasn't as long when I got there, I didn't have to wait to get a slice. There were slices already made! What?!! I wasn't used to this. I wanted to wait for a fresh slice, but this was no longer an option. The guy put the slices on a plate, and my first thought was.... ugh, these look nasty! I was tempted to order a whole pie fresh but figured I'd give them a try. What a mistake! Everything about my slice was ALL wrong. The cheese was hard, crust was cold, and it seemed like it had been sitting out for way too long. This was not the pizza that I remembered. I really wished that Dom were back to make the pizza. I don't know if it'll ever be the same as when he was there.

129,Eric G.,1.0,4,"What a slice. Just got two slices for take out.Plain slice only not the square slice. But boy what looks simple tastes so delicious. Love waiting for the fresh pie to come out and watch them cut the fresh basil on top. The sauce, cheese and crust all blend together in a way that's just sublime. May look like other pizza slices in New York but the taste is far superior. Came in around 7pm on a weekday and there was no line. Very old school vibe, like nothing has been changed since opening. $5 a slice is pricey but you don't have to go often as long as you go once to give it a try.

When you come here, expect to wait because he takes his time making pies since quality is his utmost priority. You can't go wrong ordering the classics. My favorite is the Sicilian pie with pepperoni and cheese. If you're ever in the area, do yourself a favor and grab a pie from this place.",2/15/2018,367,131,551,GT21VEsUayBwSjzACt3CzA
132,Shyann C.,1.0,2,"This place was a major disappointment. I grew up in NYC for 18 years and I went to Murrow HS right around the block. I've never tried it till this past weekend and my experience has still left me very ticked and disappointed.My crew of 4 total waited 3 HOURS!!! They tell everyone the wait is 1.5 hours!!! DON'T SAY 1.5 HOURS WHEN THATS BULLSHEEP. I knew there was a wait but this is ludicrous.There was not much seating and a lot of us were waiting outside all over like bums. Marland, my homie (see his review below) bought us 2 squares WHICH WAS BOMB after waiting about 2.5 hours. HOWEVER, whoever cut it should be FIRED. ONE SQUARE IS $6! Each square was maybe 2x3 inches. Such a damn shame especially with their reputation. After an eternity of waiting outside, we were able to sit inside with dim lighting (can they please provide one or two lamps...). With high expectations, the pizza finally arrived at 5 PM (we placed our order at 1:30) and it looked great. After digging into our plain pie with extra cheese, we noticed that the dough was tough and tomato sauce and cheese has evaporated. It was overcooked!!! This pie was $32!!!!!!! WHY?????? I'm done. You get the point. This was a waste of time and money... they had the right ingredients but wrong execution. Disappointing for my first try. I will never be back especially there was too many amazing places in Brooklyn alone. I had to go to Joe's Pizza in the city to satisfy my pizza cravings that night. God damn pizza shame.",4/24/2019,389,178,222,nsxZLh3zfPvlUGizK44qVg
133,Hersh M.,1.0,5,Great pizza! Everything tasted super fresh and homemade. The hot peppers they have for you to add put the pizza over he top. I preferred the thin round pizza because the square was a bit heavy for me. Make sure to come at least an hour before you plan to eat because thats the minimum for how long it will take.

There are pizzerias out there that might have better pizza...sure, but they more or less owe it to this guy. His ingredients are directly imported from Italy and overall carry a rather hefty price tag. 5 bucks for a tiny slice or 30 bucks for a thin pie might not be economical for many. But honestly, it's certainly worth a taste, even once in your life. Overall the pizza is relatively thin, the dough is uniquely fresh and the cause and cheese are on point. And to top it off, fresh hand cut basil and olive oil drizzle...this is the classic slice we have grown to love!",5/9/2018,227,160,339,HotEGqyhwbVOtitlztiIsQ

Even the crust is salty which is still fine but I wouldn't wait in line for it ever again.

136,Christian V.,0.0,1,"Update:We rented out Di Fara's for three hours yesterday for a private party. It cost us $1000 at approximately $50/head.The experience was a total mess.First thing first, Dom did not make any of the pizzas. So if you were expecting his pizza making skills at your party. Sorry, you'll be out of luck.Second, while we rented the entire location for 3 hours, we did not receive a single pizza until nearly an hour after the party started.Third, private parties here don't go uninterrupted. While the party is supposed to be ""private"" about 20 people burst through the door during our party. They even let the next party in before ours ended and let them start decorating.Fourth, the hood that removes smoke from the kitchen was broken so the entire place filled with smoke. People's eyes hurt and you could see the smoke through the air a mere 15 feet away. About half of our party would escape for air every 30-45 mins. On a cold day, we had to leave the front door wide open just to clear the smoke. It was unbearable.Fifth, the pizzas when they did come out were burned. Not a tiny bit of black around the edges, but obviously burned. Char all round every edge. Pepperoni and sun-dried tomato burned on the top, charred as could be. Blackened pizza bottoms.$50 for four burned slices and breathing smoke. You do the math--------We made the pizza pilgrimage today to visit this longstanding legendary pizza staple.Our wait was about 10 minutes until we ordered 2 pies: 1 pepperoni and 1 classic. The pizzeria is simple old converted corner store. Besides the pizza oven and dough mixing stands, Di Fara lacks many of the visual indicators you're in a pizzeria. The menu is a tiny and faded image in the backdrop. The few tables inside are narrow and wood veneer. If the 25 or so people who are inside at any one time, only around 12 can sit at any one time, leading to people churning tables as their pizzas arrive and Di Fara employees set order to seating.When we finally received our pies around 45 mins after ordering, we were not disappointed. The dough was pleasantly crispy, the cheese was creamy, the sauce lacked the overly sweet sugar or overbearing spiciness of cheaper pizzas, and the pepperoni was flavorful.Di Fara is one of the best pizzas in the city. It's difficult to rank any restaurant given how food quality varies, but top 10 in NYC would not be a stretch.",11/11/2018Updated review,161,58,5,kQRgcpnk1UJk7HaA50kEnQ

Every morning like a Brooklyn slice. Let's go to Di Fara's, the Greatest Pizza in New York. My lady brings me here. I'm third-wheeling; she brings a friend. The line is short. I marvel at the Hebrew lettering on the Walgreens across the street. Walgreens in Hebrew across from Italian fare. Di Faras is the greatest pizza, they say. It'll change your life, they say.The old man is here drizzling olive oil on the pies. I'm obsessed with fat. I love oil. I tell my girlfriend I like fat. This conversation colors my Di Fara's experience. She thinks it's about her because I put my hand on her waist in line and squeezed her, salivating while staring at the oven. The people I'm with bore me. They're vegetarian. I think I have to come back with Ben and Daniel for the sausage and anchovy kind. So that I can hear the boys say real things to each other. The boys aren't sensitive. I tell Tess I can't wait for the pizza. That I think she's beautiful, that I don't care that we can only order margarita slices (they only do their special pizzas as whole pies). I tell Tess I'm happy. Long lines aren't good for awkward group outings. I convince her friend that I like it here, that Brooklyn is good for now, that I actually don't miss California that much. Di Fara's doesn't exist in CA, I say. We can't get pizza like this in Los Angeles, I tell her. We eat our slices outside. I peruse the elevated train and the black hats. I'm having one of the world's greatest slices, my life is supposed to change. Brooklyn remains grey. The slice was maybe underwhelming. I don't understand hype of any kind. The oil coats the mouth. It's spicy on my tongue. In ways, I've forgotten how to feel. We may venture to far things and stand in line. The mark of our generation is buying food. But food, Di Fara's, I'm sorry to say cannot not change my life. I have the same family. The same insecure girlfriend who wants to run for office. Don't get me started on people who run for office, I say... I'm a curmudgeon at 27, respecting Mr. Di Fara types. Guys who make pizza. People that paint things. Or make roads. Things we actually need. I'd pay Di Fara's another visit. But pizza is pizza.

138,Alyssa K.,0.0,1,"I was really excited to try this pizza, enough so that we ventured about an hour from Manhattan via subway to do so. Luckily when we got there around 6pm, there was no line, so we walked in and ordered two pies - the original and square. The service off the bat was nothing special, and I couldn't help but feel like I had just walked into a restaurant that let their reviews get the best of them. After about 20 minutes, our order was ready. We tried the original first, which was good, and the square after, which was also pretty good until I found a thick black hair under the cheese of my last slice. Despite the fact that this is totally gross, I do understand that it does happen. My friend discreetly brought it up to management, who proceeded to question us and told us she would ""check to see if it was one of our guys."" After, my friend left the restaurant to get cash at the ATM next door. While he was gone, we could hear the hostess and servers mocking the situation and my friend for thinking it was a hair from their own staff. My friend then came back and was told we would be discounted $4 for the specific slice..... four dollars...on an order totaling over $75...If management had simply apologized upfront, I would have left feeling much better about the situation and the restaurant as a whole.

Went there today to give it another try and it was worse this time than last... the regular slice crust was doughy and flopped over when I picked it up, the flavor was meh and both me and my friend were both disappointed. The square slice was much better with a crispier crust and better taste  but the price tag is heavy... $6 a slice... lol! We work around the metro ny area and try to get to as many different pizza joints as we can in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan and in any one of these boroughs we can get 2 slices of superior tasting pizza for what it costs for one slice of thiers.  P.S.

We waited about 30 minutes our regular pie with pepperoni, and pizza was FANTASTIC! I really enjoy the crust, and it was soo good and crunchy. They use fresh basil on every pizza which makes it more delicious. We had to grab the pizza and run to Kings Hwy station to get home on time. Pizza was still delicious and not soggy at all.

Wanted one square but since they just opened it would have been a 40min wait. Very limited seating, 3 fold out tables with maybe 15 chairs all together. Taste: 8/10 very good slice. Sauce was light and not much oil. It tasted like olive oil. Cheese was delicious and not heavy at all. Surprisingly the crust was actually very good. Crispy crust not chewy.There is a lot of hype for this place and much of it is warranted. Best slice I've ever had? I don't know. I'm a big fan of John's on Bleecker street. Nevertheless, if you want a good slice this is definitely worth it. $5 plus a $1 for a topping is a little much though. But all their ingredients are fresh and these days the price of cheese is ridiculous. Glad they didn't raise the price to $7.Ended up staying til 215 because I was enjoying a conversation with a guy who had been eating there since December 1965 (the place opened in '65). As luck would have it channel 11 news stopped in to ask Domenic what he thought of de blasio and lasting eating with a knife and fork. They then interviewed Lloyd( the guy I met, who also refused to give his last name to the PIX lol). Lloyd then recommended Ostrovitsky's bakery, which I gladly went to for desert.

Run up to the door and there's a sign that the dining area was closed for a private event. Noticed there were several people standing at the window at the corner so we quickly found out that they were waiting for the place to open to place an order! To go only but we were down.  It was an hour before they opened and we were the 3rd group in line. Figured with only 3 parties ahead of us it wouldn't take that long - nope! Just before they were supposed to open we saw lights and other activity and were then told the old man wasn't there yet - UGH. About 10-min later the daughter takes the first group of orders including ours and has them ready for the old man when he got in.  Our group traded off and on in queue while we window shopped the many Jewish deli's, bakeries, etc that lined the street. By the time our pie was ready we were loaded with treats and goodies in tow.  From the time we got in line to the time we got our pie it was nearly 3-hours. 1 hour early, 1/2 hour until the old man showed up and another 1.5 hours to get our pie after ordering. We took the daughters advise and for a party of 4 we ordered the DiFaro Classic Square pie with a slice of round to just try.  During the time we waited the dining room was never used, I'm assuming they just didn't want to bother with it, especially when it was raining. Easier to keep the hungry crowd outside on the sidewalk!It truly felt like we won something when we finally got our pie and took it to the car to eat.

As several people told me before I went, it's good pizza but not worth the travel out there. They were right.I wasn't able to order a slice with any toppings. Toppings were only allowed if I bought a whole pie and since this was our second lunch, getting one slice each was aggressive enough. You have two options: Square slice ($6) or Regular slice ($5). The square has way more crust so I was not into that. I got the regular while my two friends got the squares, and they were served two slices that had been sitting out for a while... they were no bueno. I got mine freshly made, but that came at a price of waiting 30 mins. And I gotta say, it was just okay. Super thin crust was great, but just nothing special about the cheese or basil.

However, I wanted to make clear the basis of my disappointment for those who, like me, bought into the hype and made the long trek to this seemingly very Jewish neighborhood at the end of Brooklyn for pizza.I came here on a Saturday around 11:15, almost 45 minutes before they were going to open, and there was already a line by the bus stop to the left of the store. Everybody in line seemed to be a tourist, judging by some of the overheard conversations. The couple in front of me were arguing about whether they could get from brooklyn to ellis island/the statue of liberty using the subway. The line grew fairly long, reaching about 25-30 people before openingFinally, the place opened around 12 and I walked in to see the owner standing near the oven next to a small box of basil leaves. He had only two employees helping him, a younger man in the back who he entrusted to get toppings and a man taking orders. The place itself was covered in reviews suggesting that we had reached pizza nirvana. There was almost no seating relative to the number of customers -- maybe 10-15 seats for many more people.I ordered an entire pie and stood by the counter, watching the owner make the pizzas. I found the method of preparation a little odd in that he didn't take cheese and distribute it equally along the pizza, but rather cut the cheese into oblong, irregular chunks and then set it at the edge of the pizza. He also watered the pizza with oil afterward, which I had never seen any other pizza maker do. I am not a pizza chef so it is possible that this is a good idea, but the final product made it seem like it is not. He also had a habit of opening and re-opening the oven for periods of time as long as 5-10 seconds, causing the temperatures inside to fluctuate. After about 30 minutes, the pie came out of the oven and his assistant cut the basil on top of it. Again, he cut it in such a way that some slices had lots of basil and others had barely any basil. I don't know why this is. I sat down and tried the pizza, grabbing a hot slice. It immediately flopped back onto the plate as I picked it up, half the slice imploding under so much hot oil. I corraled and took a bite. The basil I could hardly taste, the cheese had little flavor, the crust was soaking wet, and the sauce was tangy but in a mystery sauce dollar slice type of tangy way. As I ate more and more of the pizza, it didn't get better. It just got more inconsistent. Parts of the pizza were dry and chewy, others were burned, and yet others were very soggy.Overall, I left pretty disappointed. This may have been a bad day, or the pizza may have changed over the years, but I believe even my two star review is being generous. Again, if you love the pizza, I am not insulting you as (1) you may have gotten a better slice from the same place as pizza quality can be variable; (2) we may just have different tastes and I am certainly no pizza expert. I tried to like this pizza as I love food and love finding new foods that really perk me up, but it just didn't work here. Lots of respect for the man who is still making pizzas at his age and for any business owner who can make it work for years, but I will save my money for other places.",3/11/2018,0,11,1,6cNYPtwsqMV_CO5-T6sfDQ
163,Eric K.,1.0,4,"Di Fara was the first true New York pizza I ever tried in my life; back in 2014, I was mind blown by the quality, including of course the basil cut from the windowsill by the man himself for freshness. Classic and priceless. I remember walking to the venue at 11:30, half an hour before opening so that we could be the first ones in line. By the time we hard ordered the line was out the door and around the corner, and my friend and I shamelessly devoured a whole classic pizza and considered lining up for more slices. I think this memory has put an unfair standard on all pizza, including di fara, for me. This time around, there was surprisingly no line, and the original di fara owner was not around. My family and I tried the classic and square pizzas, the classic laden with savory and meaty sausage and onions on top of a crisp, thinly baked dough, the square on a sourbread-esque dough. Both were great, classic new York pizzas, and if I am around town I would come back, but unfortunately the recent experience didn't match my impossible expectations. But I'm still grateful for the family for introducing me to my first New York pizza, and hopefully something will bring me back in the area so that I can visit again.",12/2/2018,651,107,165,OiLTZfmhOpyvHaHWV4e1Pw

165,Glenn V.,1.0,1,"The build-up preceding my first DiFara pizza experience was epic. How the pizza is created with the best possible ingredients, how the sauce is made, that the pizza gets topped with the freshest ingredients, so on and so forth.After giving my name and order, I hunkered down into my book ready for the wait time lore that eclipses the pizza lore, one hour on the average. Two square pies, one regular -- no toppings for a mere ninety six dollars and zero cents. Ripoff.Then it began to rain which bothers me not, just gotta protect my literature, I watched others scrambled for cover -- but shelter was not to be found inside, the ragtag cardboard sign sorta legibly expresses.One hour and thirty minutes later, no pizza & no mention of my order from their tick tack toe design on a yellow legal pad told them. But a simple flip by any worker a page back clearly showed- -Glenn 2Sq 1Rg-- please know, I inquired three times during this wait, pointing to my order on the paper. Still, nobody had any clue why my pies hadn't gotten started at the one hour, fourty five minute wait.With 4 hours committed already including travel time, what choice did I have but to wait and take it.The pizza was finally served two hours and ten minutes later and it was low grade quality across the board. Everything explained to me about this place, clearly was from YEARS gone by. DiFara is only a name. I'm still taken back by the experience and will never, ever return.

For my husband (who is from New Jersey) I insisted we go to Di Fara's for our first dinner date (he had never been) and it changed his perspective of pizza forever after.

The sauce, the cheese, the basil - all work together perfectly. I got lucky today and found a parking spot by the front door and no one - no one - in line (5:30 on a Thursday).

So when I saw the size of this tiny slice, I wanted to cry. In order to leave the best lasting impression in my mind, I only limited myself to 1 slice and decided to go have a hotdog at Nathan's boardwalk afterwards.The place is worn down and counters are filthy. But do we care? Nope. And nobody there wears any gloves and handles cash and pizza. But do we care? Nope. The lines are million hours long. But do we care?

178,Anthony V.,0.0,4,"I'm sorry. I tried. I really tried to like DiFara's. Let's start off with the good: I won't deny that the toppings are top notch (talking fresh basil, wild onions, prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes!)  The zesty, chunky tomato sauce and the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese are definitely on point. But that's where it ends. It was the crust that broke the deal. It was burnt beyond palatable. Or should I say a ""well-done"" crust. Which some people like, actually. But it could not stand up to the tomato sauce, ultimately getting overwhelmed and soggy to the point where I could no longer pick it up. Disappointing. Think about it: pizza is and always will be a humble food. It was never meant to cost $5 bucks a slice or $30 bucks a pie. Pizza was never meant to take more than 2 hrs to bake & serve. Notwithstanding the heat and humidity of a typical New York August, let's just say: overhyped and overpriced.",6/9/2019,0,2,0,WL3rbGK7hGMJZx18pj5HMA

Would happily down a whole pizza by myself in the future. Only downsides are that it's a little pricey for pizza and the wait is indisputably ridiculous.

This institution has been turning out great pizza for 50+ years and there's one man to thank, Dominic. He's the pizza wizard who's been manning the ovens since the 60s and refuses to give it up. We ordered a large cheese pizza and three square slices as we wanted to taste all the options. The winner by a long shot was the large cheese because of its simplicity and refinement. The copious amounts of fresh basil that Dom hand cuts on top are truly unique to his style and it's such a power move. All that being said, be prepared to wait a long time for this pizza as he moves in slow motion, but it's worth the wait. Our wait time was close to 2.5 hours from the point where we ordered. My suggestion, grab a corner store beer and enjoy the salivating wait.  Given my allegiance to New Haven style pizza it's nice to know that Dominic has NYC nicely represented.

All the hype about this place is well deserved!When I came here it reminded me a lot the pizzeria i went to in napoly, people outside waiting for their pie and hanging out drinking soda and having fun. I came in a little before 1 pm, the location of this restaurant is in a commercial area of avenue J so there are meter parking spots all along the avenue, I was fortunate to find parking right in front of the pizzeria, by then there was already a full hour and a half wait for a pie. I was told many great things about Mr. Di Fara's pizza and they are all true, but let's start from the start. They do sell the pizza by the slice, in contrary to what I was told,  that only whole pies were sold here, so if you just one a slice you may actually not have to wait as long and get your slice right Away,  just as I did. CASH ONLY, so make sure to bring some cash or you will waste a lot of time, this restaurant only have a handful of tables so try to take it to go and avoid the wait for a table.  The pizza: there are no words to explain how amazing this pizza is, there is not one ingredient that makes it great or stands out. The entire synergy of flavors have it's fair share on the success of this amazing slice of pizza, the dough is crunchy, the sauce is to die for and the cheese is of a taste that I have never experienced before. The fresh basil ties the entire slice together and all you can hope for is for that slice to never end. I can safely say that is is the best pizza I have had in my life. If you ever wanna come and have some, do so and try to not leave it for tomorrow, only Mr. Di Fara makes the pizzas here, so once he decides to retire this legend will only remain with the ones who came and tried this legendary gastronomic amazingness.",4/29/2017,655,620,4829,3GXPuSZNRB7l-EB7LU4IDg

They were very busy and the guy making pizza was overwhelmed but the pizza is still #1. If you come here for good pizza and you are a pizza lover it's worth it. They could have a better system in place to make them run more efficient but the quality of the pizza IS THE BEST.

If you time it right you can walk out with a slice with virtually no wait...however, good luck being satisfied by one slice LOL.

That said, being Connecticut born and bred, if it ain't apizza, it ain't pizza...except this place ranks in my top 5.While I certainly wouldn't make the schlep a habit, this pizza is definitely worth hauling yourself out to ""far ass Brooklyn"" (so coined by friends who live in Woodlawn and have decided Prospect Park is the delineation point for ""far ass Brooklyn"")  at least once. Dom DeMarco ain't getting any younger and you have to watch him methodically assemble the pie and then go reaching into the oven barehanded to pull them out like a badass.I feel like they should use a second tier of the oven to speed up service, but alas - there's probably a reason why they don't.",5/22/2017,164,890,533,ElDfk_42hMdjU_weLWRKtA
210,Charles B.,0.0,4,"I've know Domenico DiMarco for 22 years. This was before anyone even knew the infamous name of DiFara's. I was told by Domenico that he got the name from the 1st two letters of his name and the word Fara which means ""flour"" in Italian. So the name DiFara means from flour. When I first met Domenico, I was introduced by my private sanitation contractor who happens to be a bit of a foodie. He told me to meet him on East 14th Street and Avenue J for probably the best pizza ever. My response to him was that I don't eat Kosher Pizza. Over the years Midwood has become the mecca of the Jewish people. I didn't know that this little gem was tucked away in the middle of Midwood.Anyway, I digress, I met Steve and was introduced to Domenico. I was told to have a slice and, ""tell me that isn't the best pizza you ever had"". Truth be told it was exceptional.The following week I paid Domenico a visit and found Dom, seated at the rear table eating. I approached him and he asked me to sit down and asked if I had eaten. I told him, that if I have already eaten, I would not be there. He asked me if I eat rabbit, ""coniglio"" in Italian. I reaponded yes. We sat down and had roasted rabbit in rosemary, olive oil, garlic, salt/pepper, onions and white wine. We drank some wine with our meal and discussed how Domenico wound up in Midwood from Napoli. I was intrigued.Today Domenico and I do not have the time anymore to sit, talk and savor his hidden culinary delicacies which have been overtaken by his pizza making skills.How I miss those days.

The basil is cut fresh and it not only tasted delicious but smelled amazing as well.Overall this is a great pie and 5* worthy but it took almost an hour to make since we got the whole pie and that's the reason for the 4* but I don't think that would be relevant if just getting slices.",5/31/2017,555,431,1110,zMKWSl7SxxPW3nidytb91g

Those were the best study sessions. The pizza is phenomenal. Every pie is given a great amount of time in order for it to come our perfectly. They're all topped off with olive oil and fresh basil; a small herb that makes a huge difference on your pizza. The pepperoni is thick and delicious.Order a full pie. It's not worth ordering by the slice. Plan out when you're going; I've waited twenty minutes and I've also waited two hours.

The dough was crispy, the amount of cheese and tomato sauce was perfect, and the basil was delicious.- All of the pies/slices are made to order by Dominico, the owner, himself so you know you'll be getting a fresh slice made by someone with decades of experience in the field.- The place itself probably hasn't changed much since it's conception. Could be a good or bad thing I suppose but it does have a rustic charm.The bad:- $5 a slice...- The wait...Even though it may seem like there aren't that many people waiting inside for their orders, it still takes at least 20 mins for you to get your's, even if you're only getting a slice, because they only use one oven (at least when I was there) and because you only have one elderly man in his 80's making all the pizzas.- Unorganized service...I ordered a slice before another guy who came in after me but he got his slice first cause the cashier forgot to look at her notepad to see that I had ordered first...not cool.Would I come back again?

He was extremely friendly as well. The place was pretty quiet and most of the folks coming in were local neighborhood folks and they were greeting them by first name. The square was my first try. You can taste the fresh ingredients. The crust was dense, crispy and perfectly charred. My only complaint is there was just a little too much sauce for my liking other then that it was very good. For those who complain the pizza here is too oily the reason why you taste oil is Dom Demarco drizzles olive oil on top before the pie goes into the oven.",1/5/2018Updated review,71,458,1341,74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ

I'd rather go to artichoke's for the same $7 a slice of thick artichoke cheesiness. There's very little seating, but you get to watch cute ol' Dominic make the pizzas.The lines are long only because 4 pizzas fit in the oven at a time. I definitely suggest eating it hot and fresh out of the oven. Don't take it to-go. Eat it while it's hot and fresh. Bf and I learned out lesson. We were told there was a 40min wait after putting in our order of 3 pies for a game night party, so ran over to shoprite to grab some chips and drinks. Came back and their orders were a bit backed up and pur pizzas weren't in the oven yet.

There's only room for 8-12 people inside so if you have more than one person with you, have one secure a spot if you can. Make sure you are ready to order and DONT be shy ad ask people if they places their order. If not, just get in there. It's more like a bar order. Make eye contact order a slice or a pie and you pay after the pizza is cooked. Give your name and that's it.I suggest you put all the condiments. Garlic, oregano and pepper flakes.

232,John G.,0.0,3,"Born and raised in NYC, I am a pizza critic at heart. I wasn't necessarily disappointed with the pizza, it was just that it came with such a hype that I literally expected it to be the be the best slice I've ever had. We purchased a round and square pie. The wait wasn't bad, about a half hour for both which would be expected for a fresh pie in my opinion, although most people stated it would take even longer. Nonetheless, after the barstool sports review of this place and a friend recommending it, we finally made the short journey. On a 1-10 rating, I give the regular slice a solid 7.5 (not the 9.4 the Massachusetts native, barstool sports owner gave) & the square slice a 7.0. Both respectable scores. It was good pizza, not great.  I enjoyed it, though wouldn't go out of my way to find it.P.S. There was not the old man making every pie as I was told and what was shown in the pictures within the place. False advertising there.

Although the restaurant is small, with hardly any seating, a long wait, and your order comes out piecemeal just depending on what they have available, I still thought it was worth it. The sauce is very unique and super fresh. It tastes like tomato sauce is supposed to taste. It's a more saucy"" pizza in my opinion. It comes out piping hot so it can be kinda messy with the cheese. The regular is very simple and I didn't add topping because often that just overwhelms the pizza flavor. Sometimes less is more. I preferred the slice over the square though they tasted very similar.",10/11/2018,26,884,434,nW8ujzozMdCPeEhD-_QRcA
234,Marland V.,0.0,3,"If you aren't ready for a lengthy review of one of my favorite things in the world (other than my family, my girlfriend, my dog, my friends), then please skip to another review that is more accommodating. Pizza is something I take quite seriously. It provides joy, laughter, and lasting memories to those who consume it. NYC is blessed as there are countless pizza shops ranging from gourmet to the $1 slice quality as well as your average (but still tasty) slice of pizza. Regardless, they are all worthy in their own way. This review is about a few of my experiences in Di Fara's. I've now been there 3 times; the first I waited about 90 minutes, the second about 2 hours, and the third a whopping 3+ hours. Di Fara's is a name known far and wide because of the quality and care that is put into each pizza pie. These guys don't mess around. After all, if you're waiting for 3 hours just for a pie, you got to expect their best. Sadly, the third time was not the case. My girlfriend's sister was visiting from LA (originally from NYC) and I said let's go have the best pizza ever. After over 3 anxiously frustratingly long hours, we finally got our pie with extra cheese. I even ordered a square while we were waiting. The square slice is $6, it says it right up front. But when you don't cut a square pie correctly and the slice you give a customer is clearly smaller, this shouldn't qualify as a $6 charge. I did accept the slice as she gave it to me, but I was very disappointed. The taste of the square was phenomenal along with the quality of the sauce, oil, cheese, and dough. But nonetheless, at $6 a slice you can't mess with size. As for the pie, it was very disappointing. About 40% of the pizza crust was clearly ""charred"" and ""blackened"" from being overcooked. The crust and pizza itself was hard and difficult to chew. Mind you, this was not my experience the first 2 times but the owners need to keep in mind that if customers are waiting 2, 3 or 4 hours for a pizza, they better make sure it's damn perfect (or near to that). This wasn't even half of what we expected and we walked away feeling disgruntled and unhappy. What upset me the most is this overcooking was very clear to the person serving it. Anyone with eyes can see how well done it was and if you have patrons waiting for 3 hours for a pie, this is considered unacceptable. I want it to be known that when these guys make a pie to the best of their abilities, it truly is the best damn pie you'll have. But after 3+ hours of waiting and a girl who traveled cross country, and you get an overcooked burnt pie without so much as an acknowledgement, you are disappointed to say the least. I will be back as I am a fan of second chances, but I doubt the remainder of my party will be.",1/2/2018,68,79,55,C21ThqA-cuEVeDBKyDlNZw

There was one guy - an artist who uses pizza as his medium - working the dough and the ovens. While the atmosphere of the place is on the lower end of the spectrum, the aroma is spectacular - an intoxicating blend of fresh, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil and olive oil. I promise that your mouth will water just sitting there. And once your pizza comes out of the oven (mine was a plain pie) you will be well rewarded for your patience. Thin, crispy, with flavors bursting forth and complimenting each other like no other pizza before or since. My only piece of advice, that I'll be sure to follow next time, is to call ahead so you might get served a little sooner.

No way we were waiting 2+ hours for a pie, so we settled on the last two slices they had left. Meh is all I have to say. Seriously though, the average age of the staff when the daughter isn't working is like 75. You then understand WHY it takes 2+ hours for pizza. This guy is moving like a sloth putting together these pies (and probably why the pizza is $30 a pie ;p cause it takes an hour of labor to put together).I digress, his colleague who was taking the orders and topping the pies was so unsanitary it was disgusting. The guy is handling money (cash only), then grabbing all the toppings with his hands to put them on the pizza without ever washing them. I understand they are ""old school"" and some of you fellow yelpers could care less about anything sanitary, but this is just disgusting. He even was touching the basil with those grimey hands before putting it on the freshly cooked pizza. I digress again.Believe what you wish, but this old man needs to get with the times, and hire someone less than 65 years old who can make pies faster than he can and still maintain quality (it's very doable). For me it's about the experience as well as the food, and this place disappoints big time. If you've gotten this far, this review doesn't even matter because people will still flock to this place in hoardes to wait like sheep for something there's better of in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

Out of all the pizza places that have generated a buzz. I would say this place deserves it. It is a gourmet pizza. He uses quality ingredients, you can taste the olive oil in the pizza. It is not greasy nor heavy. And not like other higher end places the crust doesn't taste like charcoal. I would say though because there is a wait and the pizza slices are on the small size I wouldn't recommend it if you are hungry or in a rush.  But it is worth planning your day around.",7/30/2018,12,71,1,jlqdXjSCmIQL-PDybmA7mg

The sausage topping has a nice flavor and I enjoyed that.The regular slice of pepperoni and onion was just wrong.  I think they messed up my order because I could not figure out what they was on my pizza instead of pepperoni.  It was a ULO (unidentified laying object).  Weird texture and flavor.  I would have sent it back, but after a few bites that would have looked a little weird.Maybe I just came on a bad day, but this is not worth a repeat visit.",4/28/2018,50,504,12,jd1ghWRsfB_tIYVggFk3tA

However a co-worker told me about this and made me try it. It's a tad greasy, but the flavor is just perfect the way I like it. Cheese and old-world pepperoni is just superb!Now, i've said i've only tried it only a handful of times on Avenue J, however....I temporarily moved to Vegas and guess what....DiFara opened up a restaurant there, named Dom DeMarco's! I ordered the Brooklyn style pizza and it tastes just the same! I definitely had my share of calories here. Happy it went west coast so I don't have to miss that wonderful flavor.Lets move on again. Now I live in Oklahoma. No more DiFara's of Avenue J, and no more DeMarco's of Vegas. I have to fly out east or out west to try my favorite pizza.....wait.... no I don't! Andolini's, a pizza place of Tulsa's has one item on the menu named:""DEMARCO OF BROOKLYN 20"" An homage to Dom Demarco of Di Fara Pizzeria on Avenue J in Brooklyn. This pizza, like Dom's, has the same DOP San Marzano tomatoes he uses with slices of our house made fresh mozzarella. Fresh picked basil, Pecorino Romano and loads of extra virgin olive oil.""Wow, how lucky am I! Now i only have to drive 1.5 hours to try DiFara's pizza! It tastes identical to the original!

Perhaps, but this is about as good as it gets, and I'd highly recommend it to any true pizza lover.Also, for what it's worth, I went at 2pm on Election Day and there was no line. I can't imagine I'll get so lucky the next time, and I'm sure this added positive points to my experience, but I think (hope) I'd be able to evaluate the pizza on its merits regardless.

Cleanliness:  looking around the corner in the prep area I noticed it was a little off and a bit grubby looking.  Clean food is the best food.  It says alot. Quality: I will gladly pay your price for an exceptionally delicious pizza.   So when i spend $15 on just three slices I'm gonna be expecting an orgasm.   That unfortunately did not happen.   What i had bought from Di Fara was run of the mill.   Not good not bad but it was not worth $15.00.  Groupthink:  People flock to this joint in hordes extending to the end of the block as if they are awaiting to be blessed by some sacred being.  When this happens people become delusional and start overhyping this place standing in line for 2 hours blabbering foolishly about the pizza they're gonna buy.  Guarantee if the same exact pizza were made and then sold next door with zero crowd or hype you'd get this reaction   "" MEH ITS OKAY ""  most people are too foolish for their own good.  Just goes to show how easily influenced people can become.

After reading the reviews, watching YouTube videos, and TV programs, I had very high expectations of Dom DeMarco's famous pizza and I have to say; this place did not disappoint!I heard about the lines and even saw videos of it stretching out the door. I didn't know if I could wait up to an hour and thirty minutes for a pizza, and not only that; would there be space to eat there?Came out on a Wednesday at about 2pm in hopes to avoid the rush and lo and behold - there was no line! At first I didn't know if we were at the right place, but as soon as we walked in and I saw Mr. DeMarco, the Pizza King himself, I was ecstatic.  He was actually here, and he was actually making a pizza on the same exact counter I saw on TV!Had to play it cool, didn't want to look like some creepy pizza fangirl tourist. Amazed to see no line AT ALL, I walked up to the counter and ordered two (one cheese and one pepperoni) ""pies"". It's cash only, and I had it ready in my hand just in case the guy behind the counter yelled at me for not being fast enough. But surprisingly, he was extremely nice (with that awesome new york accent) and said I could pay after we eat.There was actually a table available for the five of us to sit at, so we just waited patiently, while watching Dom at work. Now, let's just get to the pizza! Dom chopped up fresh basil (his signature move) and scattered it on top of the Pizza and handed it to me. Wow. I took a bite and was in pizza heaven. Who cares that I scorched the roof of my mouth and that olive oil leaked onto my shirt - it was worth it!The pizza hype was real.The cheese pizza was good, but the hubby preferred the pepperoni. I'm telling you, it is hard to get this guy's approval, but he admitted it was the BEST pizza he has ever had!It was an awesome experience being able to watch Dom make our pizza and then to add the basil. If you're ever in Brooklyn, I highly recommend Di Fara's. In my opinion, it's definitely the best pizza - made with love.",9/27/2017,42,51,74,A_TwClVTDfQG5lH_jQzU0Q

Went for the DiFara Classic Pie W/ Sausage, Peppers, Mushrooms, & Onions  for $35.When we places the order, Mr. DeMarco was making the pizza but shortly after his son took over. I guess Mr. DeMarco was tired since it was late. Not sure what the issue was but the dough and ingredients seemed off. Almost like it needed another few minutes in the oven. Or maybe the son was rushing, but who knows.

Not to my surprise because I read the yelp reviews and sure enough there was a line to order the pizza. They were about 15-20  minutes late opening. However, when the staff arrived they immediately started taking customer's orders. I had to be about the 7th person on line and I only ordered one slice. I conversed with a few people on line and surprisingly a lot of them were regulars and not tourists or first timers like myself. I waited another 20-30 minutes for my one slice and I sat down inside sharing a table to eat my thinly sliced but great tasting pizza. The crust was soft, hot and delicious, Unfortunately I didn't review Yelp pictures to notice the slices were extremely small and unfulfilling with jus one slice. LOL. Was that great taste worth $5 or the long wait, ummm No!   It was cool to see the elderly owner still personally making those pizzas and appearing very passionate and dedicated about his pizza.

He finally delivered after 6 years...We were surprised to see the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrive. We each ordered 2 regular slices , as one is always never enough. The first bite had great flavor from the tomato sauce. Next, I noticed how thin the pizza crust was but yet how deliciously chewy it was. I enjoyed that it was already topped with some shredded parmesan and fresh basil already. As I continued eating, the tomato sauce grew to be more salty but still flavorful. The best part of the pizza slice was the crust - slightly sweet , a bit charred, and chewy. This was great to try once but at $5 a slice, it is difficult to convince myself that it is worth $5.

283,Fox E.,1.0,2,"In Italy, Farrah Fawcett was known as ""Di Farrah"", and they loved her so much that this Brooklyn Pizzeria was opened in her honour. Charlie's Angels might get served quickly here, but I certainly didn't, maybe because I don't look like them.Amazingly, I've now been here five times, and have encountered some utterly awful customer service, and have never once been able to get a slice because of the preposterously long wait times for a slice. I will eventually try one, but I really don't think it should be so hard to get one, and if it must be so hard, then surely the employees can at least be civil with the people choosing to wait over an hour for a slice (or choosing not to). It seems so gimmicky to have the place packed like sardines, standing room only, waiting an eternity for slices.My previous review said:I'm looking forward to finally trying their pizza. I've been here *three times*. Twice they said they were too busy to do slices (yes, I'm serious... and I don't understand why this keeps happening to me, lol), and the third time, I ordered a slice, and we stood there, and stood there, and waited for what seemed like about half an hour. We reminded them twice, and they said ""slices are coming"", and they never did. So we eventually just left.Third time was not the charm, but I promise I will go back in here at some point, hopefully when they're actually willing to rustle us up one of their famous huge expensive slices. But until then, I have to rate based on customer service and this place absolutely did not do it for me. And the time my gf went in to get the slice, they were not very nice to her at all.D-Fara scores a ""D"" for customer service.

284,Thomas V.,0.0,5,"What can I say about Di Faras that hasn't already been said?  Been here a few times and has never disappointed.Couple things off the bat.  There is always a wait, oftentimes 1.5-2 hours.  There isn't always seating, which is first come first serve.  As you wait, the store gets so crowded you might have to wait outside, which in the winter time is always cold.  In terms of food pricing, it is quite expensive (approximately $35/pie).  It's kind of a trek to get to in parts of Brooklyn that you probably wouldn't have any other reason to go to other than to eat at Di Faras.  However despite all this, it's still worth darn it in my opinion.The cheese, the oil, the piping hot tomato sauce, crispy basil.  There's nothing quite like it in the world.  You can't go wrong with the Classic  Pie - sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions.  Or you can make your own pie and pick your own toppings.  One of the marks of a great pizza place is that if you later eat the leftover, even if cold, you start craving it again.  And this definitely happens to me when I eat Di Faras.So many other things.  The man makes every gosh dang pie.  Sure, that plus the fact that they only have 1 oven makes it why there's always a long wait.  But no way will I think they would be ok with building bigger, franchising out, etc to make extra money like Grimaldi's.I also like the way they take our order.  The write it down on a pizza paper with diagonal lines and confusing markings; how do they read it?  The old chicken scratch like menu on the board.  So many things that gives this place character.The owner of Lucalis and the son (grandson?) of Joes have a video on YouTube talking about their love of Di Faras, and how they call him the don of NYC pizza.I know this pizza isn't for everyone -might be too cheesy, oily and the crust may not be soft (if that's how you like it), but when visitors ask me where to go for a sit down whole pie pizza, I always tell them Di Faras.  To me, it's the best.FYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other pizza joints in NYC5=worth a trip, something you'll crave4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space1=the place should shut downThe places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e. Di Faras better than Julianas, etc.)5's (whole pie) - Di Faras, Juliana's, Keste, Emily, L & B Spumoni5's (by the slice) - Artichoke, Prince St, Joes4's (whole pie) - Don Antonio, Robertas, Barboncino, Table 87, Lombaris, Patsys Pizzeria, Speedy Romeo4's (by the slice) - Roma's, Go 99, Two Brothers3's - Johns Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, B Side2's -Two Boots Pizza, Lucalis1's - none so far",6/22/2015Previous review,79,73,40,yw2cJk_SfGZlcoZKEUevxw

287,Chris E.,1.0,4,"We came here for 2 reasons  ... 1. To witness the master, Dom DeMarco, in action making pizza one at a time AND2. To try his much-hyped pizza! And we accomplished both!Since we heard myths about the wait times and long lines, my girlfriend and I arrived at 11am on a Saturday morning and to our surprise there was not a soul waiting in line, which made us 1st in line! We didn't have others join us until about 11:15am and by the time Di Fara opened at 11:50ish, there were about 10 people on the line only. Now you might not think 10 people is a lot of people, until you realize everyone is ordering a pie and by the time it got to the 10th person, the wait for a whole pie grew to an hour!Anyhow, we were excited to see Dom making the pizzas on the day we were there as we had heard he was having some health issues so we weren't sure if he was going to be present. We watched as he worked slowly, but methodically and hand-crafted each and every pizza pie that was ordered. It was a real treat to see his simple, yet much-heralded methods.As I said, we were 1st in line and our regular cheese round pie took 10 minutes to build from scratch and cook. In total, it came out to $30, which was fine by us as a slice itself costs $5. Mathematically it made sense to us to get a pie instead of a slice. Just an FYI, that if you come here for a slice, the wait is almost zero, as it seemed they had a few pies sitting around for those just in need of a slice. Those waiting for pies had very long waits by the time we received ours.Also, seating was very limited inside and the restaurant could only seat about 15 so for the lucky first 15 into the restaurant, you're guaranteed a seat. For the rest, hopefully they can stand and eat a pizza slice, which almost every New Yorker should know how to do!So back to the pizza and the verdict? DELICIOUS! The pizza crust was very thin and some slices were inconsistent with others as there was more crust on them, but there was so much flavor in such a simple pizza. We loved the fresh basil on top along with the drizzle of olive oil. The pizza didn't have a crazy amount of cheese, but it was that secret tomato sauce that Dom makes that really made the flavors jump out!I'm not going to say this was the best pizza I ever had, as that claim goes to Frank Pepe's in Connecticut, but for such a simple pizza it was quite amazing how good it tasted! The hype was absolutely for real and we were glad that it lived up to what we heard about Di Fara. There are definitely detractors out there just saying this taste like any other pizza, but for us, this was right up there with the best regular cheese slices we had ever had. PERIOD.",1/13/2019,545,1172,10467,m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ
288,Caroline D.,1.0,5,"Best pizza I've had in New York, for sure. This place has been in operation since 1965, and the same owner still makes pizzas there - Dom DiMarco (as Italian as it gets). It was so cool to see him in action, laying the sauce down gently and spreading it out with a big ladle, picking out the chunks of mozzarella and laying them down one by one, and dousing the pizza in his salty Parmesan cheese and olive oil. Then they cut up fresh basil after it's been taken out of the oven so it's super fragrant when you start to eat. Rumor has it that Dom has been taking more days off, so you have to go before it's too late!We had the classic pie, and one secret is the jar of oily, fresh peppers on the counter - if it's not up there you have to ask for it, cause it makes the pizza even better.Crust, sauce, and cheese consistency are all on point - there's nothing negative I can possibly say about this place or the food they serve. It's at least $30 a pie but completely worth it, and you can easily share a pie between three people. Oh, and go on a weekday around 2pm, there's virtually NO wait. Others have waited hours but if you plan it right....Enjoy!",9/20/2016,802,482,29,9-_CPbm4FizEGsCKpMmatQ
289,Erina W.,1.0,3,"Great pizza, but with all the hassle in getting it, I would never frequent this place. But, definitely a must try. Some tourists make this a day trip in itself (and there were a lot of them). We arrived at opening time on a Sunday and there was already a long line. We ordered three pies. Thought it would take much shorter, but it took us 2 hours to receive our pizza, and we were probably the 10-15th group in line. Di Fara's a family establishment and every one was super sweet and nice (especially Maggie, who handles all the orders and payment). The pizza is delicious, as always. If it was a 10 minute wait, I would frequent this place more often. But due to its high cost and long wait time, I typically come here once every 2-3 years. But, my cousins and fiance had never tried it, so of course, we had to get a few pies. Three of them burned a $90 hole in our pocket.

291,Teddy F.,0.0,5,"There's all other pizza and then there is Di Fara's. Truly, this pizza is an amazing amalgamation of flavors that I have not found in existence anywhere else yet.My personal favorite is the pepperoni and the sun dried roasted peppers. The latter blackens in the oven and oozes sweet umami filled italian roasted pepper oil over all the pizza, giving it a lovely sweetness and secondary acidity that complements the olive oil and natural oils and fats from the cheeses wonderfully.The pepperoni cups into wonderful little bowls of meaty deliciousness and also contributes its own oils to the pool in this hot mess of a pizza. This may not be for everyone, and if oil turns you off don't even bother, but if you're like me and don't mind supremely unctuous heart clogging things, then this may be your holy grail for pizza.WARNING: Wait times may be brutally long during peak hours.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed the square thick slice. The thicker dough had olive oil under the crust. It's airy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. Why did I take off a star? The pizza is pricy for the area, and there is really anywhere to sit. As I mentioned before, you must order the entire pie, and that's difficult if you are just one person with a slice craving.",6/28/2018,44,234,602,dTeudRt-2Acd3A7WrqlDqg

The first bite is hot and cheesy and fresh from the basil and just wonderfully luscious. I was sharing the whole pie with my family and before you know it, it was gone! So good.

Located on a random corner in Brooklyn with the same gentleman making pizza since the 60s, this location is indeed historical.The pizza doesn't look the most appetizing coming out of the oven.

The pizza was amazing and had a very unique taste to it compared to most pizza in NYC/Brooklyn. It was by far one of the better pizzas  I've had. I think it was the fresh basil and minimal sauce used that made the pizza stand out to me. The negatives were that it was very expensive and very small. I probably wouldn't return there if I'm looking for a meal to fill me up but I would definitely put this pizza on my top five favorite.,8/18/2017,107,72,142,YXKSQvFAuoMTwEZXQD97Ow
307,Phil L.,1.0,4,"Quality pizza spot. They use quality olive oil and several types of cheeses. They top it all off with freshly chopped basil which in my opinion completes the slice. My only issue is with the saltiness of the pizza dough. Adding pepperoni on top of that (which is very good) is usually overkill on the sodium level. Aside from that, this is the go-to spot for good pizza. The wait can be quite long sometimes though.",3/3/2018,161,93,160,VVcvkxrUn14ERYCuGR818g

I've eaten much more outstanding pizza in my honest opinion. Our final bill came to $48, adding insult to injury. We got two small sodas, one square whole pizza pie and two slices. The lemon soda from Italy, sour, fizzy, cute bottle almost more enjoyable than the pizza. The people around us were going crazy. Like it was 1984 & they just got the last Cabbage Patch Kid doll.  I heard them: ""how's your slice? Omg it's soooo good."" Hype. My love just watched me. I looked at him. We ate. We commented on the sauce. Was good. Crust was burnt, hard and salty. The cheeses looked great when Dom was making the pies, but when he took them out, a burnt smoking oil laden disaster. Broken pizza dreams. We made friends in line. One had been frequenting DF for 17 years. Before Dom was a rockstar he said. Before the lines. When he made Parm Heros and pasta too. When our new friend lived around the corner. When he was still married. Made me think, this is perhaps nostalgia for some people. We should have just ordered a couple slices.

However, we did overhear the people next to us say that it was good bit that its been better. I have read they can be a bit inconsistent at times too. Overall though, I'd give it a 4 and you should check them out, especially if you're a big fan of the NYC slice. Guy in front was friendly ( the pizza chef was pretty quiet while cooking).

316,Joanna Y.,1.0,5,"I.....love....pizza... It's easily my favorite food. So my BFF (a native New Yorker who knows how much I LOVE PIZZA) planned a pizza tour for us when I went up to visit her. On the list? Lombardi's, L&B Spumoni Gardens, Grimaldi's, Rubirosa and Di Fara. We only ended up having time for 3 places that weekend (sad face -- we had a wedding to go to). We went to Lombardi's (had 1/2 margherita, 1/2 mushroom), L&B Spumoni Gardens (tried both the round and square) and Di Fara. Di Fara was by far the best of all 3. So Di Fara opens around 1 on Sundays. We hopped in line by approximately 1:15p and waited about 30 minutes just to order. We originally had plans to just get a slice or two each so we'd have an appetite for a 4th place for dinner, but finding out the wait time for the actual pizza being over an hour, we ordered a whole square pizza instead. BEST DECISION EVER.We didn't actually sit down to eat until 4pm. Which means we waited a total of 2.75 hours for our pizza. I do not regret it, at all. The crust was so flaky and crunchy. Tons of mozzarella, sauce, basil and OIL. They have some hot pepper oil to use, if you're into that kinda thing. I used some and it just enhanced the already amazing flavors. I typically prefer thick crust over thin and the square pizza at Di Fara is what I'll compare all future pizzas to... best pizza I've ever had. I'd endure the wait over and over again, no questions!

324,Sylvia L.,0.0,3,"Di Fara was on my to-go list for a long time, so I finally went and got there around 3pm. Thankfully, there wasn't a line when I went, so I was able to get a regular slice and square slice within a few minutes.I feel like I might have overhyped this place in my mind since I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza. The sauce itself is more on the savory side (almost a bit too salty for me) and the square slice is thick and crunchy with olive oil soaked on the bottom of the crust. Definitely leaves you feeling a bit heavy and probably isn't the best pizza for those who blot oil from their pizza (you know who you are).Oh well.

335,Sara L.,1.0,5,"The first real question you should be asking yourself is how long are you willing to wait for pizza. The four of us had to manage a day off on a weekday just to do DiFara, and it might be the only way to go. On a Tuesday at 12 noon (time of opening), only one guy stood waiting in line. People started to arrive around 1230 and 1. Our game plan was to order a pie each, and ultimately our wait was perhaps an hour and a half, including the line wait. And DiFara almost chose not to wake up on time that morning. According to staff, he was in a really bad mood and tired. This is how unpredictable their schedule can be so you must plan ahead and be prepared. Plan soon though, and I mean very soon.My first visit last year was an unfortunate fail, not because of the pizza, but because of poor planning. We ordered two slices each and waited almost 2 hours for them on a Saturday afternoon. The square slice was also a little burnt on the crust. I wouldn't recommend squares or just slices if waiting long (especially one with toppings) for this matter as it lacks some sort of consistency next to a pie. A second trip, we wisely decided on a pie each. If planning to wait over an hour, you might as well, and I wouldn't choose to do otherwise. Onto the actual pizza, this might be one of the best pizzas in NY. It's hard to call it the best, because it's super subjective to call it that, but it certainly ranks very high up there. If anyone feels differently, I hope another visit proves different. The first thing I noticed was how well balanced their pizza is. The proportion of sauce, cheese and dough meld so well. Not one topping overwhelms the other, but rather, everything complements one another. No cheese slides off the pizza. Oil doesn't drip from it. The sauce is excellent, and it is probably my favorite part. It has this sweetness that marries so well with the cheese. While it's not the cheesiest slice, the cheese carries a powerful yet wonderfully delicious flavor. The crust is nice and thin, with some slices almost too thin, but they will never fall apart regardless. The fresh basil just kisses each slice. I can't say what makes for a 'perfect' pizza, but if DiFara hasn't nailed it with his, then please tell me what other pizza out there does.As for the venue and restaurant itself, I love how it maintains the same look and feel after so many years. The place is quite old, but it is very charming. Call it a church of pizza if you want. I respect DiFara alot for carrying on his love for making pizza after decades. Perhaps the consistency might not be on the mark all the time, but the pizza is still so good regardless. His pizza is beyond a lot out there and is truly one of a kind. Tourists and anyone in NY who hasn't should pay a visit. If planning a visit though, definitely consider a weekday and arrive at 12 noon. Weekends are a nightmare of a wait, but you can always leave your name and come back later. They close on Mondays and might start closing up on Tuesdays as well. Cash only too. I did have leftovers from my second visit, and it was still great even a day old. That is a true test of good pizza.",11/18/2015Previous review,728,560,3619,xkM26UGl94s8OksWy2Dydg
336,Kathryn T.,1.0,5,"I can now say that I have watched a master create a masterpiece. We watched Dom make a pizza and it is one of the most mesmerizing experiences. This man cares about pizza. His family cares about pizza. And that makes it one of the most delicious, if not the most delicious, pizzas I have ever had.Di Fara is old school. It's a giant throwback to a simpler time, a more delicious time for pizza before gentrification hit. Cash only, orders taken on a notepad in ball point pen, hand poured olive oil, hand cut basil. Everything is done by hand and with all pies made to order, it's no wonder why the wait is so long. Be prepared for the wait (aka bring snacks).Re: Di Fara's classic pie. The balance of flavors is perfect. The crust is what pizza should be. This is Italian pizza. This is not some NYC knock off. This is not some basic thing. This pizza can only be describe as art.

338,Matteo R.,1.0,4,"As far as non-brick oven pizzas, Di Fara is certainly high up on the list. The crust is thin, with a nice crunch to it typical of electric/gas pizza ovens, both the tomato and the mozzarella are good quality, and the fresh basil is just amazing. Toppings are limited, so don't expect anything particularly fancy, here: this is a basic, old school pizza.We tried both the square slice and a whole pie. The square slice is slightly thicker; personally I didn't care too much for it, and I certainly enjoyed the pie more. We opted for half pepperoni and half mushrooms. Both pizzas tend to be heavy on the oil.The place is very small, as it can sit about 12-15 people max, and it can get pretty hot in there. The best time to come would be on a Saturday at 12 noon, right when it opens[1]. There is a wait to put your order in, but the line moves pretty quickly. And then there is a long wait for the pizza itself. Depending on how many people are in front of you, the wait could be anywhere between 30 min. to 1 hour.Whether this pizza is worth the wait, with so many great pizzerie in Brooklyn, is a matter of personal choice. I see it as a once-in-a-while kind of experience.----------------------[1] This is a busy Jewish neighborhood, so if you're driving here traffic is definitely lighter on a Saturday, and you will be able to find street parking very close.",5/7/2017,712,701,3270,QwY_IrZ7Xs4N1ksO6GUBOA

Luckily, we only waited maybe 5-10 minutes for a regular slice (they weren't doing squares).  Dom was behind the counter making the pies.  The helper was sprinkling the parm and cutting the basil.  Sad to say, for a bit less than $5, I've had better slices in NY.  Oh well.  I am glad I got to see a what I suppose some would call a food legend in action, but I wasn't impressed with what he produced today.  Maybe, like most hand-crafted food, it has its ups and downs.  Can I recommend it? No, but maybe it wasn't his best pie today. As yelp's 2-star rating says, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" Oh well. I can at least say it was better than burnt toast that other reviews said, lol.

Once someone was kind enough to wait in the kine for a hour and bring it home to me, it was burnt and nothing to write home about. Second time I had the unfortunate experience of waiting an hour for a pizza which was not worth the wait by any means. This is a prime example of how sheep follow the herd. I was listening to these hipsters in the place as he put basil on his pizza "" it's like a work of art"". There is nothing about this place in my opinion that makes it stand out from the crowd; except for thr fact that this old man refuses to let anyone else make his pizza. Which is selfish and inconsiderate to keep  everyone waiting.  It's really nothing special in my opinion. It's a burnt margarita pizza. He uses olive oil that you can get in the supermarket... I heard people talking about how its imported from Italy bla bla bla, yeah maybe it is but it's nothing special. I really don't see the appeal. I have eaten pizza all over this city as I have grown up here and it's just a pizza. It's burnt. It is not a bad pizza but it's not worth the wait and it's nothing special and irs overpriced. It's also shut down by the health department atleast 5 times a year. I think it's sad and amazing how the brain works, that they convince themselves it tastes good because of the wait time and old man Dom taking the time to make every pizza. Waiting in line for an hour for a fucking pizza is not an experience to me. It's a pain in the ass.... And it's not worth the wait. I expected this pizza to knock my socks off. Socks.. We're firmly in place. Sorry I don't agree with all you people giving this place rave reviews. You were probably from Indiana and ate canned tomato sauce on top of frozen crust with kraft mozzerqlla in a bag so I'm sure this is something special but it's not. It's a burnt margarita pie made by a stubborn old man with an ego and inconsiderate to others. He got himself into a gambling debt yeats ago and the mob got him a write up in the paper so he can get more patronizing to pay his debt off. That's the true story. Waste of time. Waste of money.

You can taste the tomatoes, the olive oil and the basil in each bite. I could still feel the burst of delicious olive oil when I took my first bite.

The pizza at Di Fara is indeed a step above the rest, but not quite enough for me to justify ever waiting that long again for it. You can definitely tell there is something special about these pies; the quality of the ingredients are apparent in every bite with the perfect distribution of sauce, cheese, and toppings throughout. Definitely worth experiencing and enjoying this pizza at least once if you have the time to wait.",12/26/2017,157,73,21,DUXCIOLG_-8293S_xJ_Vfg
370,Terry B.,0.0,5,"Great pizza made by a living legend! Not the greatest pizza I ever had in my life, but it is its own unique recipe and style and one of the best anywhere. Dom DeMarco is in his 80's and he is the best pizza maker in the city. Go while you still have the chance. This is a food experience.Expect a long line and be aware its cash only. It was at least 2 hours when I went on a heavily overcast Sunday and thought I would avoid the crowd due to the threat of rain. They were surprised how busy they were that day and did not expect it so a shorter wait time is not predictable. This is also a very off the beaten path neighborhood with little else to do. You can get there by the Q train to Ave J and its a short walk from there, but Di Fara is the only reason you would really come here if you're a tourist or not from the neighborhood. Di Fara sticks out like a sore thumb. You can't miss it. It's your classic corner pizza parlor that has been there over 50 years and looks that way. It's a beautiful relic. The pizza? I went with the standard cheese pizza and it is Art! He has said it himself that he views his craft as making art, not pizza and that is exactly what he is doing. One look at the pizza and I know it is his pizza. I don't care for the dusting of parm which on a return visit I would ask him to skip, but it is one his signatures along with the scissor cut basil spread generously about the pie, and the drizzle of olive oil he blasts it with before it goes in. It is a beautiful pizza to look at. At $30 a pie its expensive, but its all about using the absolute top quality ingredients many of which like the buffalo mozzarella he imports from his hometown in Italy. The tomatoes are San Marzano's. It will lengthen your wait to dine in but I highly recommend dining in, and ordering a whole pie. The slices at $5 each are very thin crust so a person like me can eat a whole pie by himself easily. Its a much better value to get the whole pie, and you might actually have to wait  just as long if not longer if it is slices you want since so many people come there just for those and they go fast. I did not get a chance to try the sqaure pie or slice but they seem to be very popular. The best part of the experience for me, was watching Dom work. This guy is the Pope of pizza makers and an NYC legend. He's quiet and will smile at you as he does his work which is his passion. He makes all the pies himself and watching him do his thing is a privilege. Its a master at work finding joy in not just what he does but how happy it makes other people. For a long time this was a way under the radar pizza place that only the locals or pizza junkies knew about. It is nice to see him getting this kind of respect and admiration, along with as much business as one man can handle. It is all well deserved. His family takes the orders and keeps things moving and their all great, especially Emily who does an awesome job handling the longest line for pizza anywhere yet always keeping a smile while doing it. This is why I say sit down and eat your pie there. This is not just a meal, its a food experience. Can't say enough good about this place or Dom DeMarco. He is a living NYC legend and who knows when it will be the last chance to have him make you a pizza so if you have the chance to go, absolutely do it and prepare to be hangry, but happy you made the trek. Its not my absolute favorite pizza place on the planet, but any list that does not include it as top 5 in NYC is a list worth ignoring. If you love pizza, Di Fara is a must. In a perfect world every neighborhood would have a guy like Dom DeMarco making your pizza.",10/29/2017,1184,113,1212,PbXWKMJS_HqqKCcy2lj0RA

374,Jackie T.,1.0,5,"Whether Di Fara is one of the best pizza joints in New York is subjective. Personally, I love their pizza. This place is a MUST go for me every time I come back to New York. There is always a line no matter what time of the day you come. If you order a slice of pizza, you'll be in and out relatively quick. If you order a pie, that'll be an hour wait. Personal advice: make sure you get up there and put in your order and don't let nobody cut you off and delay you from getting that delicious pizza. There are a few tables inside where you can sit and enjoy the pizza, but they're usually occupied by people.Their pies cost around $35 which is totally worth it in my opinion and I want to say they cut it up to about 8 slices total. For one slice of pizza its $5. I highly recommend the pie and have leftovers because leftover pizza is da bomb!Dom makes all the pies himself still for the most part. The pies are made when after you order. Every thing is fresh. The dough, the ingredients...and you can most definitely taste it. Usually, the pies come out a bit burnt, but that's the allure of the pizza here in my opinion.",2/26/2016,66,434,333,2-9eAwWcTS_tnFhE0cTHhQ

Well, there was no line until about 30 minutes before the restaurant opened at noon. Once we actually entered the establishment, the wait was only about 5-10 minutes for our regular pie. The pie was EXTREMELY oily and salty. As in if you tilted the slide vertically, gobs of oil dripped out. A parsimonious amount of basil was placed on top in an uneven, slapdash manner. Worst of all, it was overbaked, so it was too thick and crispy on the bottom, and the crust was very hard (and flavorless). This is one of the worst pizza experiences I've had in the last 5 years. Absolutely not worth it, and as others have iterated, definitely not worth the trek, wait or $30.",1/22/2017,65,245,550,rYTVfPlPC_lHrSL2-huDQg

The slice itself was the perfect combination of crust consistency, taste, the bite of the cheese, the fresh basil and it held up perfectly to the classic fold-and-bite. I tried both a regular slice, and a plain square. In a word? Cowabunga.The only thing I could possibly say is that I really wish the staff would wear gloves. P.S.

Quite possibly Yes._________________________________Pizza:Cheese: 10/10The mozzarella is delicate, perfectly melty, and milky. The extra parmesan sprinkled on adds another layer of texture in the savory oil on top of the slice. Sauce: 10/10The tomato sauce is ripe and naturally sweet, with small chunks of plum tomatoes in the sauce. Tastes fresh and full of life, not canned and flat in flavor.Crust 7/10Harder than other crusts I've tried. The slice ""crunches"" when you fold it in half. But I think this is appropriate as it adds a firmer base to hold up all the melty cheese, sauce and olive oil. The only thing I would note is that our pie was a little charred, and the crust could be a little more chewier (personal preference)Wait Time :1/10Expect to wait an hour or more. It's long and there's no way to get around that. Really, set aside an afternoon to come here.Price: 1/10$30 something for a pie, $5-6 for a slice. Makes the most sense to split a pie with a friend and pay around $15 per person._________________________________The little sprinkle of chopped basil is sweet and peppery. The pizza slices are a little oiler than other slices I've had, but note that it's not a sick, greasy oil. It's the aromatic and fruity olive oil combined with the sweet oil coming from the cheese. If wait time and price was not an issue, I think we might all agree that this is quite possibly the best slice of Pizza you may ever eat. Is it worth $30 for a pie and an hour plus wait?

It wasn't too far from where we were staying, and just off the Q so no complaints about location. We arrived about 12:45 and they opened a little late, maybe just after 1:15 or so. We thought we'd be saving time by ordering slices but nope- same wait as a whole pie. Be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait (about an hour just for $5 slices). But you'll be rewarded at the end with legit Neopolitan pizza (I can say that, I've had the real deal in Italy). The flavor is unreal- you can taste the fresh ingredients, from the high quality olive oil to the freshly cut basil and simple yet tasty sauce. The crust was perfectly cooked, thin but chewy with a slight crunch. Unfortunately, they were only doing plain rounds so we didn't get a chance to taste the coveted square (but apparently you can pre-order them the day before) but hey, it was Father's Day so he could do what he wanted. It was hard to be disappointed after tasting how good the round was- and just means we'll have to make another trip to try it!

400,David D.,1.0,5,"Although I've been to Difara's several times, I hesitated to write a review.  Why?  Among my friends, it's been a controversial place.  On the one hand, some friends (who shall remain nameless) whined and complained about the jolting experience of waiting 4 hours for expensive pizza (those manboys can go to their financial district haunts).  On the other hand, the more tempered, pizza-purist, friends who I brought with me waited stalwartly, almost reverently, for a taste of the legendary pie.   Look, coming to Difara's is not about eating pizza for lunch or dinner, it's a pizza pilgrimage; a stop on your way to earning one's pizza-appreciating credential.  In other words, you better come here before you dare to compare and rank pizza.  The above stated, DiFara is worth the wait.  You can peruse the 750+ pictures here or on Google Images.  You will notice a certain style: Thick tomatoes instead of watery sauce, olive oil drizzle, thick pepperoni, freshly cut greenery atop the pie, their mixture of buffalo and cow's-milk mozzarella, and uneven fire-and-brimstone crust.   I prefer the square pie over the round personally but they're both good.  I won't comment much more about the actual pizza taste because this is about the experience.  Some added tips for your experience:  If you go there you can acquire an email address to actually place your order ahead of time to reduce the wait.  Also, they just opened up yelp.com/biz/di-fara-dol… so you can go there while you wait.  Going at opening during the week is also advised.  Bring your Ipad and some good people to chill with.",12/6/2015,2122,266,1374,P6OBUNnwvMqRr3dFwjDHTQ

410,Brittany T.,1.0,3,"3.5 stars.WAIT: Came on a Saturday around 2:30 pm and the wait seemed really small, then we realized the wait comes AFTER you order.  Because the owner makes the pizza to order you have to wait until he puts it in the oven and if there's orders before you then you have to wait until they are served.  If you order a slice you have to wait until there are enough slice orders to cook an entire pizza and then they slice yours.  We waited about 40 minutes for our 3 slices.ATMOSPHERE: You see the owner making the pizza in the back and then you order with his helper then try to sit down and wait.  I think a lot of people leave and come back later because it wasn't super crowded inside.  There are only 3 tables in a U shape in the back with probably enough seats for 12 or so people.  No bathroom, very minimal inside.FOOD: The reason this place is famous is because supposedly the owner doesnt let anyone else make the pizza and that is how it has been since he opened it.  He's probably in his 70s and you can tell he puts a lot of effort and love into making each pizza slowly putting the toppings on and creating each one.When you order (whole or slice) you can get the normal slice or choose 2 toppings.  I would recommend sticking with the plain one because it's pretty good and the more toppings the heavier the pizza gets.  The regular slice is cheese but comes with fresh basil cut on top, so it tastes almost like a margherita pizza.Overall, the pizza was too soggy for my liking.  The ingredients do taste fresh, it's piping hot when you get it and it is flavorful but it's one of those pizzas that just slide off when you bit into it so you take half the cheese and toppings in your first bite leaving only crust.  It wasn't quite as crispy on the bottom.  The end crust was good though, soft on the inside crispy on the outside.Not sure if I would wait more than I did for my pizza here.",4/19/2018,1399,816,1536,PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg

426,Yuan J.,0.0,1,"Given the fame and popularity of this place, I would have expected that the restaurant would have already optimized their operations and have a process for getting their pizzas to their customers as quickly as possible. Oops - didn't do enough research for this one. Despite coming here at 12:30 for Friday lunch, we waited for a full hour before giving up. By 1:30, there was a crowd of around 50 people waiting both outside AND INSIDE the place without having gotten a single bite of food. At that point, I walked in and tried to ask where in the line my order was and roughly how much longer we would be waiting. The first woman I asked gave me the stink eye and walked away from me. The second woman that approached me flipped through their yellow notepad halfheartedly, revealing that 1) there were still roughly 20 orders ahead of us, 2) they had only completed 3 orders in the 90 minutes they had been open, and 3) that she couldn't give me a time estimate. Her exact words were: ""Don't ask me, I can't give a time."" And then she walked away too.I would have been ok if she were just honest and told us that the wait would have been three hours. But the service here is just so rude, I wouldn't have enjoyed the food here even if I had gotten it right then and there. Perhaps it was because I looked like a tourist with all of my cameras, but it was super clear that none of the employees here cared about any of their customers, and especially didn't want to waste any of their attention on someone like me.",9/1/2017,407,139,737,ySl_GUTqkjqfhK8_VbyIMg

Maybe some people like that burnt flavor but I certainly do not. Plus, even if you order it with toppings, you don't get a lot of ingredients. So you might as well just save a few bucks and order it without.The place is small but they treat it like it's some exclusive club. They rope off the entrance and even hired a (teenaged) bouncer to make sure nobody gets in.After waiting online for about half an hour, and then another 40 min - 1 hour for the actual pizza, you start to realize somewhere down the line that it really isn't worth it - time wise, or money wise (it isn't exactly cheap....a single slice will set you back $5 and I feel like I've had dollar slices in the city that I've enjoyed more).I feel like people who love Di Fara's are really just holding onto this memory that they had years ago of what Brooklyn pizza is like.

437,Queena T.,1.0,2,"Wow I'm not sure what the hype is about but I just spent $32 on a pie that could have passed as Two Boots Pizza. Lots more cons than pros:Cons:- We ordered the Classic Di Fara Pie and was expecting fresh mozzarella cheese, instead we were greeted with oily cheese meant for only 99¢ type pizza- No flavor and lack of tomato sauce that should be the base for all pizzas -  Was supposed to open at 1PM on a Sunday but didn't open and start taking orders until 1:20PM, so everyone who came at 1Pm sharp to avoid the lines had to wait an additional 20 min for the place to even open. I would understand if they were opening at some asinine hour in the morning but it's 1 o'clock in the afternoon- 10-15 minutes after we put in our order that was specifically 'to stay' the front doors still had not open for patrons to properly sit down and eat their pizza. Luckily there is bench outside the shop because that was where everyone had to eat their pizza even 30 min after the store ""opened"". We finished our entire pie and the front doors still had not opened and there was a line 15 people deep. I got the feeling they wanted to create hype by creating a line outside - All patrons in line seemed to be first timers not regulars which seems to support the fact that the pizza is extremely mediocre. Also no one should ever have to wait in line and eat on the side walk like a hobo for that poor excuse of a pizzaPros:- Crunchy crust bottom- The owner was still putting together all the pizzas which was impressive given he was way passed retirement ageThis review is extremely harsh mainly because I felt like I trekked all the way out for nothing. There is nothing else around the area that would warrant coming out to the neighborhood since it's largely residential. I also have a preference for neopolitan style pizza which is paper thin crust, lots of tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese. If that is your style I would recommend Roberta's in Bushwick, Lucali's in Cobble Hill or Juliana's in Brooklyn Heights.",6/10/2014Previous review,130,386,236,nRHreRvxWdg_m99JVElu0g

From experience, wait time here ranges from 10 minutes to 3 hours. I want to give this place a lower rating because I feel the pizza is overrated and pizza is occasionally served burnt but I can't give Di Fara's any less than 4 stars because I find myself craving the distinct pizza. The crust is crispy from the pool of olive oil placed in the pan before it is baked. This basically fries the crust and yields this incredible crunch (unexpected for a slice this thick). After the pizza is taken out, more olive oil is drizzled over the pie and topped with fresh basil. This place attracts people of all kinds.

440,Graciela C.,1.0,4,"So you're not sure about visiting. Here's a reviews meta-analysis. Me, like you, have read a lot of the reviews, specially from the Elites, thank you guys. This is what you will first off gather:1- The lines are long2- The pies and slices are expensive3- They are greasy4- They are salty5- There's no seating space6- You will wait for hours7- The crust is more charred than normalBut I will tell you what was true for MY SUNDAY, October 11, 2015 at 7:30pm and 65F weather outside:1- Parking, right at the corner2- No lines outside, Only waited 5 minutes for the slice3- Straight out of the oven, piping hot and leaking fat4- There were available tables and chairs (albeit dirty)5- Regular slice $5 (no toppings)6- They ran out of sicilian slices (boo)7- Greasy (normal), but it was very salty, and I am by no means a low salt eating person. That is true, as well as the crust, which was chewy and warm, thin and definitely one of my favorite parts. Fresh basil cut on top before serving makes all the difference, oh that aroma. The tomato sauce is excellent (barely sweet, fresh tasting, non acidic)8- Yelp says it closes at 9pm, they hung a closing sign at 8pm, possibly due to low clientele? because it wasn't due to long lines for sure.I was unsure whether it was worth the wait before I came. To my surprise there was no wait and the slice was very good, not the best i have ever had, but if there's one thing you must do in Brooklyn (notice I am not saying NYC), you should visit Di Fara. Some people don't think its worth it, some love it, but honestly, the man has gotten where he is for a reason. At one point in time, he made an amazing pie and critics and food lovers loved it (as well as the majority of visitors). So Yes, you should go and have it at least once in your life. It's only $5 that may change your life. Just may. And do visit before it is no longer there, if you know what i mean.Btw, I lived in Brooklyn for 9 years and have had my fair share of pizza slices in all kinds of places and all kinds of times (4am anyone?).

We ate our slices while waiting for our pie. They do cut fresh basil on top of the pizza and that gave it a nice taste. Initially, the first bite of fresh pizza was good but looking at it, it was so greasy. The dough was alright, still crispy since it was fresh out the oven. The pizza felt extra heavy in my stomach after. Way too greasy. As for the pie that we brought home, that was awful. The dough became soggy and biting into it was like biting into straight curdles of fat. We warmed it back up in our conventional oven hoping it'll be better tasting. It helped a little, but I don't recommend bringing Di Fara's pizza home to eat. This is one of those places where I would just go there to try it at least once and probably not come back.

445,Walter W.,0.0,1,BE WARNED! DO NOT ORDER A WHOLE PIE! ORDER SLICES INSTEAD! Let me tell you why:They prioritize slices to customers instead of whole pies. Why would you prioritize a customer giving you $5 over a customer give you $30 bucks? Who knows. But if you do order a pie get ready for a 1-3 hour wait for it while on hour 1.5 watch as someone walk in ask for a slice of a pie that you ordered and walk out in 5-10 min with a slice. So if you have like 3 people I would never order a pie but just order 6 slices instead. It'll come out in like 20% of the time it would take a pie.As for the actual taste of the pizza... look we all watched the youtube/food channel clips. We all heard the hype. But this place is a big let down. At 5$ per slice I don't know how they competed so well in Brooklyn especially with Leon's and Grimaldi. Don't get me wrong the pizza is good. And it's probably the best slice out of all the like 99 cents whole in the wall pizza places. But it's not next level good. Save your money and save your time.

453,Jp C.,0.0,4,"Great pizza, expensive as heck ($30/Pizza, $5-6/slice), long 2-3 hr wait outside standing in the fall/cool weather.Perfectly crisp crust, not flimsy or floppy like most pizza. Excellent fresh basil on top, really makes a huge difference. Handmade by the owner himself, no one else touches the pizza. Each pizza is at least slightly different from the ones before and after it. Great soothing music like Ave Maria and a few others  plays over and over again by the cooking area. Reminds me of what my mother played on Sundays when she cooked our big Italian family meal that took hours to prepare.Came here specifically for the pizza, I used to take for granted when I lived in Brooklyn. It took me a total of 10 hours to get here, then the 3 hr wait (I usually never wait more than 15-20 minutes in line for food, it's just not worth it to me, after all it's just food).Only after moving from NYC to DC and then the West Coast did I realize that NYC Pizza is so much better. All worth it since I haven't been there in three decades, but the killer - not until I got the pizza and a place to sit, did I learn it is cash only (ouch!).I never carry cash. Big problem. I hate cash only places and I'm suspicious of any business's stability that takes cash only. But Di Fara is different as its owner Dominico) is old school and obviously very successful so why should he incur credit card processing fees, especially when an ATM is nearby.But they were nice and offered to allow me to eat first then go to an ATM nearby.My only complaint is no signage or website mention of the cash only policy. The owner's daughter was nice but a little snippy when I suggested they put a sign ir website mention. She said of the thousands of customers it has never been an issue. Surely I can't be the first to be surprised or make the suggestion. I'm not smarter than other people but maybe I am just a true New Yorker and blunt.Had I know about the cash only policy, I could have gone to the nearby ATM - I stood around for almost 3 hrs doing nothing, so I had plenty of time.Would I stand in th cold for so long or even in the warm weather or indoors beyond 20 minutes to eat this pizza? NO!!! It's tremendously overpriced and just not worth the wait. The pizza is good, but other pizza places can be a close substitute as well. Someone in line mentioned a place called Furinos as being as good or better.",11/6/2016,0,83,125,U8NZXzQ8JJnVYc8gPj6pvg

The two hour wait and the looks of the pizza joint seemed a bit skeptical to me but the history is definitely what got me. Walking in and seeing the pizza man at work was so mesmerizing :-)The place is tiny and a little grungy but the pizza is so incredibly delicious!! It is hands down the best pizza I've had so far. We got the Di Fara Classic Pie, which is $34. It was the perfect amount for the four of us, as each of us were able to consume two slices. A couple friends who had gone a couple hours before us had fallen so in love with the pizza that they returned the following day haha! I don't know if I would do that, but it's definitely worth the trip if you're ever visiting New York :-)",2/20/2017,640,172,114,6moOhbW7pyszkvKIQt_pMQ

460,Jennifer J.,1.0,4,"Di Fara is for the pizza freaks out there. You know who you are. Dom DeMarco is the master, and you are his worthless slave! He'll make you stand on the sidewalk, not up front, but around the freaking corner. He doesn't care whether it's hot and humid or snowing like a mother. You wait with the rest of the freaks for your turn. When you finally get to order, he doesn't ask your name. You are reduced to your initials, then you wait some more! After another agonizing wait, he finally lets you inside. The tables and chairs look beaten and abused. The chair you're sitting in is barely hanging on. There's no AC up in here, and there never will be! If you want to get really dirty, set foot in the bathroom, if you dare. But none of that matters, after all of that torture, one bite and he owns you. Gotcha! Dom is the cutest pizza making grandpa I have ever seen. He single handedly produces each delicious Sicilian pizza. As with any thin crust, the less toppings the better. The pie is an oily hot mess, but slurping it up is what makes it so damn delicious. There are no utensils meaning, there is no clean or easy way to eat it. It will get all over one's lips and hands and quite possibly even the table or one's clothes if one is not careful. The square pizza does indeed taste better than the round. The price per slice is steep, but a whole pie is actually a good value. Waiting on Avenue J in the humid month of July and sitting on a rickety folding chair with no AC is just plain torture. But if Dom De Marco can smile in the heat as he stands over each of his creations, so can we. I'm glad I tasted it, but would I return? Maybe if I happen to be around Midwood in the cooler months and can order a whole pie to share with enough people.

462,Chris L.,0.0,4,"I have to preface this review by saying I've seen many pictures and videos and Difara's on TV food shows and have to say the plain pie did not look that great although the square pie did.  I went into this not expecting alot from the plain but was surprisingly wrong.  Was it worth $30? Not to me but to experience one of the places that always rate high on NY Pizza lists, had to try it.  Friend was visiting from Florida and really wanted to go so we did.Got there early on a Saturday morning to not only beat traffic and find parking spot but since colder out didn't want to wait in any huge line and especially be able to get table.  Parked about 4 blocks away but that was OK at least found street parking. They open at 12 and we got there at 11:10 on a Saturday and first in line so happy about that.  Line started around 11:20 and by the time they opened a decent crowd had gathered.It's a small place, there are 2 wall tables that fit 5 on one and 6 on the other and a circular table in the back for 2-3 that we snagged being first in line.  It is definitely a tight fit in there.So we ordered a plain pie, sat and waited for our name to be called which took about 15 minutes.  Most seemed to be eating slices except a couple of others had whole pies as well which came out after ours.  When it came out piping hot, it looked a little better than most pics I've seen.  The basil is a nice touch and plenty of sauce where you could taste it (although a little bit on the salty side but still good).  8 slices.  I thought it was very good but also on the smaller side and part of one side was deformed but that was ok.We decided since we did not live nearby and not totally full, to try a square slice ($5 each) and it was also very good, lots of sauce which I like and ooey gooey cheese.  So can at least now say I've been to the famous Difara's.  Wouldn't say it was the best ever and kind of pricey but very good.  Was very happy famous Dom was there still cranking out pies at his age, that was a plus.",12/1/2017,1,99,229,BcLbtlBMjO-HV3_Sw3O2IQ

The only problem was the tomato and the crust was a little burnt but other than that it was very tasty. (4.5 STARS)For the second pie, I got DiFara's classic (mushrooms, onions, sausage, peppers). This was alright as there were two ingredients that I didn't like - peppers and onions. (3 STARS)Pizza was fresh and I liked how they cut some fresh basil on the top of the pizza and sprinkle some fresh cheese at the end.What I thought was really cool was watching Dom work his magic at his old age.

The customer complained about her told 45 minute wait turning into a 2.5 hour wait and the daughter apologized (I wouldn't even call it an apology) and had this ""oh well suck it up"" attitude. If there's anything I learned working at restaurants, you listen to what your customers say and apologize nicely but holy, the daughter was just rude ""I'm sorry but we can't really do anything, just enjoy the experience. What more do you want me to say?"" When she said this, I was seriously thinking, what are you even saying right now? To top it off, she said everything with the biggest smirk on her face. FAME is getting to their heads and I seriously hope other people see it and stop coming here. I witnessed it happen and was speechless. Who talks like that to their customers especially when the customers have the right to go on a rant for having to wait 2.5 hours when they were told 45 minutes. To top it off, my pizza had a soggy middle. I can't really rate the famous Dom's pizza since he didn't make mine either. OH, don't bother asking where you are in line.. I asked like 3 times and they all never responded and Yes, they heard me because they even came up to the window and asked me what they can help me with.

The pizzas were extremely salty and oily. The crust was thin and a mix of crunchy and chewy in different spots. Honestly, I have had dollar pizza that is better quality than Di Fara's. At other pizza places with comparable prices, the pizzas are also much larger and more filling.

I was lucky to have only waited only 5-10 minutes, after reading some of the reviews on here saying that customers would even form a line outside the store before it's even opened. You know a pizza place is good by looking at its storefront with its serif vintage font, wooden counters and a old man working on the pizza behind the counter.  It may not be the most hygienic pizzeria in the world (workers not wearing hats, flies around the whole store, used pizza pans on the tables), but this will do. I had the regular slice. I had to wait a few minutes but I was satisfied at the fact that my order came fresh out of the oven. After the pie came out, freshly cut basil is sprinkled on top of the whole pie. The price is a bit steep, but once in a while is ok. The slice sort of had a thin crust feel to it with the cheese melting and running off. Overall, I enjoyed my pizza here and it's great to know that there's still pizza stores from 1965 floating around NYC.",8/20/2015,335,777,2058,wpfvF8ue3yr1m5xD4OrZNw

Wait a few minutes to put your order in, and then come back in an hour or two. They'll call your name and you get your pie.

The smell of basil, authentic olive oil, yeast,  and tomato sauce  in the pizzeria is intoxicating, however when we took it home and warmed it up slightly it just tasted ok.

497,Andrew W.,1.0,3,"In retrospect, it probably would have been impossible for Di Fara to live up to the hype, but my pie was still a good pie.It hit all the right notes for a good pie: crisp yet chewy crust; bright, tasty sauce; gooey cheese (though Di Fara's vaunted 3 cheese blend didn't have the distinct light tartness of the mozzarella di bufala that it supposedly includes), and freshly cut basil, all in the right ratios. It just... didn't do anything special for me. I still consider New Haven pizzas to be the best, and Sally's plain pie to be the best plain pie in America.The prices are also pretty ridiculous, as plenty of media outlets have reported. In as saturated a pizza market as New York, there's simply no way the quality of ingredients at Di Fara's could merit such a markup. At $30 for a plain pie, you're really paying $20 for the pie and $10 premium for the feel-good novelty of watching your pie being made by a wizened, hunched over octogenarian whose been making them almost every day for the past half century.",6/16/2016,467,277,54,PAgjsdqMLTlmZaZu9n7GSg

501,Alan A.,1.0,3,"I have been hearing about DiFara pizza for quite some time. Friends kept telling me it's the best pizza you could have. My wife and daughter decided to go there for lunch today. After telling me the wait for pizza could be up to two hours, I told them to go, have a good time and bring me back a few slices to try. I refuse to wait up to two hours for pizza, no matter how good it's supposed to be.This was not the first time that I've reheated pizza and most times it tastes better the next day. My first impression of DiFara's slice is that the crust was way too thin almost transparent in spots. The sauce was good not too sweet and the cheese was very tasty. The fresh basil on top was interesting but not my thing. The square slice they brought me was way to sloppy the thin crust was barely able to hold the sauce and cheese. It is OK pizza, not the best I've had and certainly not the worst. I also think paying $32 for a regular pie is highway robbery. I can get two pies at any of the places listed below for that kind of money. You're paying for the name here and that's something I can't eat.Like I said no slice of pizza is worth a two hour wait and $32. I'd rather go to Joe's on Carmine St or New Park in Howard Beach or Lillian's in Forest Hills for a slice. No waiting necessary at these pizzerias. If I'm going to spend 2 hours at a restaurant it will be eating and not waiting. Once is enough for pizza from DiFara's. Your mileage may differ.",7/20/2016,147,361,2213,nu6b6GpbSMXeQeE-u4sf0A
502,Maggy R.,0.0,1,I do not understand what all the hype is about. Do people just follow the crowd and have no opinions of their own? This was the worst pizza I have ever had.

503,Allister D.,1.0,5,"This is by far THE best pizza I've tasted in NY. The owner whom which is in his 70's and still making pizza till this day is running the show still.The first thing I noticed was the small intimate store itself. A couple tables and the kitchen itself. Dom, the founder and pizza godfather was in the kitchen rolling dough and making the pizza by hand, and still keeping a closed body language. The whole hr me and my friends were there, there was not one time where he acknowledged the customers or even faced forward; he just stared at his cooking the whole time and would peep a word or two to his son who is serving the pizza and ringing the customers up. We ate two different kinds of pizzas: traditional Sicilian pie style pizza & the original flat crust. The tomato sauce is fresh and well pronounced as well as the cheese. The crust from the Sicilian style is crispy and almost had this fried-texture to it. The pepperoni soaked up the fresh olive oil and curled up to make this nice crispy texture. Everything about both types of pizzas was tremendous. I love how fresh their pizzas are! Dom even takes a bush pile of fresh basil and just trims is down! It's a sight of beauty when you see the cheese bubble on top and the basil leaves slowly drop on the pizza like autumn leaves.I am thankful to witness Dom DeMarco put in work while he's still healthy and making the pizza. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The pizza is really worth the trip to BK and it tastes like no other. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had.",6/7/2015,916,1760,1789,cJCYCEfDL4n5TgU9y8RTWg
504,Connon O.,0.0,3,"3 stars for the 3 hour wait. I'm from Cali, I've read stuff all over about difara. We showed up at 12:50 on a Sunday. Line was about.. 15-20 people deep. So I figured that wasn't bad. Sadly I was mistaken. The entire dining area was reserved for a group of about 15 guys. At around.. 1:20 the line was then taken to the cafe that sits just right behind the pizza shop. We were told when we ordered that a whole pie was going to take 1 hour and 30 minutes. I said fine, I came from this far who knows when I'll be back. At about the one hour and 15 mark we kept checking back to see when it would be done.. Finally around 4:10ish our pie was done.. I don't know if it was the uber long wait.. But I had set the bar high for this place. I understand he makes them all one by one and they use imported cheeses. However, I couldn't get into it. Don't get me wrong the pizza was good ""except the charred inedible crust"" but I didn't expect to spend 3 almost 4 hours waiting.I've got this place checked off the list, I just don't feel that I'd come back if I was ever in the area. Everyone was friendly despite the growing crowd. But don't come here expecting to sit down and eat all within an hour.",4/25/2016,44,104,60,mglW7YGu4Df15msXUhOJLQ
505,Mike L.,0.0,4,"I have been going here for over 15 years, its on occasion I go here these days given how far this place is and the wait here is long. Its one of the best pizza places in America, and one of the top in the five boroughs, although its not as consistent as it was in the past. This used to be a very quiet corner shop years ago when I started coming here, and in recent years became a destination spot where you see a lot of tourists. I would say the experience was better back in the old days but its still a cut above most slice shops in New York and definitely worth going to at least once if you are a person who loves pizza. I believe Dom is not there regularly these days so its different but I think the quality is still pretty close if not totally the same as it was when he was the only one making pies.",10/12/2018,1,200,0,0ByT3_PF9_YPG25fzo2wYQ

Just make sure you get here sooner than later or they will run out of dough and close for the day. There is a slight wait when your food will be ready so call ahead to reduce the wait and reserve your pizza. I tried the Di Fara Classic and Square slice with pepperoni which were both different but amazingly delicious. Di Fara Classic- The onions, sausage, mushrooms, and peppers are a harmonious medley with fresh basil cut on top to wrap it all in a delicious bite. Square Slice- Pepperoni, cheesy mozzarella, basil with a nice crust from the deep pan is even better than the classic This is a must go for any pizza lover!",7/10/2017,130,127,4,xPUjjq1rLRyCkEs8AXmRww

Supposedly all the ingredients are imported from  Italy.  Maybe that's why the price point is so outrageous.  $12 for two kinda small slices.  Pizza was good but it didn't make me crave for more.",5/4/2016,443,610,858,eA0Bzjhz-a5pvLs8ReXoFg

They opened at 1pm on Sunday's. The line grew 3x, they finally opened at 1:17pm. We ordered 4 regular slices (with fresh snipped basil) and one slice with prosciutto and cherry tomatoes.

The store hours are posted as opening at 12:00 Noon. The employees were inside, but the doors were not opened until about 12:20. Square slices were not available, so I can only comment on the regular slice. It was a good slice of pie. The second visit, and my last, I was number 1 in line for an hour. The doors opened at 12:32. It was clear that no pizza could taste better than the bitterness I had developed by this shops inability to operate during their posted hours. Not wanting to support a place that treats customers so poorly, I did not buy anything. Mr. DeMarco seems to be growing tired and putting in less and less effort.

514,Lawrence G.,0.0,5,"I have lived in NYC for 10 years and have sampled quite a bit of pizza.  NY slice, thin-crust, Sicilian; down to Little Italy and up to Belmont.  I will keep this short.  Di Fara is the best.  Period.  (Read below for longer tale).I came to Di Fara spontaneously when I was in the neighborhood and waited 1:45 for a regular pie.  During the wait, I read various reviews:  NYT, Anthony Bourdain, the usual suspects.  Praise upon praise upon praise.  'That good?' I thought.  Impossible.  The pizza shop is small, with the owner, Domenico DeMarco, personally preparing each and every pie, with this children manning the register and performing other tasks.  An Italian immigrant himself, Mr. DeMarco, now in his later years, continues, deliberately though now languidly, to prepare the pizza, in fact, only roughly 150 pies per day.  Over 50 years:  same spot, same man.I took the first bite, and that was it.  The best.  It was so obvious.  Three cheeses, olive oil, San Marzano tomatoes, and freshly cut basil grown from Mr. DeMarco's personally garden.  The flavor was other-worldly, incredibly complex and rich, yet light.  Not only was this the greatest pizza I have ever had in my life, it is one of the greatest foods I have ever had.  When Zagat first rated Di Fara, they gave it a 27 for food:  one of only perhaps 20 restaurants in NYC.  The man is not a pizza maker - he is a pizza artist.",6/10/2017,0,45,0,ozFgdgtNYT4_L2kkPJUCLw

Nice and thin, perfectly crisp to the bite, it's quite the amazing experience. It's refreshing and not heavy at all in the stomach, but perfectly crisp and not oily. I still dream of eating this pizza in California, but hey, I guess it gives me something else to look forward to on my next trip to New York. TIP: Go early and no wait!

The Sicilian slice was way better than the regular.  Mostly because it had more sauce (and flavor) and was Not burnt.  I've definitely had better slices elsewhere without the wait.",3/25/2016,130,151,93,SJJkVL7z8_Gn8gM2IWDpSA

Now to break down this review of why I gave Di Fara's pizza 2 stars are:1. Pizza was over done, you can tell the cheese was burnt. 2. I was told my order would be filled within 45mins-1hr, I didn't get my pizza till 4 hours later. (That alone should tell you I wanted to try it so bad). 3. The crust was hard. I could not enjoy eating the pizza. 4. Considering you're being charged $30 per pie you'd expect the pizza to be big or even regular sized. When I brought the pies home (in queens) it was to my family's disappointment that the pies were smallish than most pizza joints. DI Fara's is very busy, I guess I had the bad luck of having the not so good pizza. I hope to come back again, and try it once more before my mind is set. However, the staff is very friendly.

Our gambit paid-off in a big way. Not only was the line a relatively short 45 minutes long, we found parking right outside. I ordered my usual pepperoni and sausage pie. The pies are overall pretty good. On some occasions they are great on other not so much. But this is a very different pie than the typical NYC neighborhood pizzeria. DiFara's make a custom production each and every time. This pizza is handmade from the moment the dough it placed on the counter to the moment is is pulled out of the oven with no tools. You have to see it happen and taste the pizza for yourselves.

539,Eric J.,1.0,4,"How do I feel about Di Fara? I like the pizza a lot, and I'm glad it exists, but it's just so hard not to wonder if it was worth waiting upwards to 3 hours for a pie. I've had both the Di Fara Classic (sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and onions), and the plain Sicilian, and both were incredibly delicious. It's a fairly unique taste that you can't really get anywhere else. Who knows if it's magic? Yet, obtaining this pizza obviously has its benefits and its caveats, which I've tried to outline below:Pros: - High quality, fresh delicious ingredients (fresh basil and olive oil)- Very rich, flavorful pizza (both square and classic), with a fairly unique flavor and crunch- Made by someone who definitely knows his stuff- The feeling of accomplishment of waiting a long time for something good (this could also easily be a con)Cons:- Extremely long waits, both due to the preparation time, and crowds- Expensive as fuuuuuuu (~$33 a pie, $5 a slice)- Cramped seating and standing arrangements- Mostly all imported (but delicious) ingredients, if you're a stickler for local sourcing. I don't really care too much myself, but I guess some people do.Life-changing? Probably not. But if you have the time to spend and have never been, I do recommend giving Di Fara a shot. I know there are very polarizing opinions out there on Di Fara, but Dom ain't gonna be around for that much longer, and who doesn't love a pizza adventure anyway? Either that, or you can just hire someone from Taskrabbit to get the pizza for you, ha. But again, it just tastes a little better when you've done the work (waiting) yourself.",2/11/2016,486,924,1839,eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw
540,Paige C.,0.0,4,"The first time I tried Di Fara's was 6 years ago. I was waiting in line thinking 'why am I paying $5 for a slice?' But it was SO WORTH IT. After finishing the airy slice with the perfect amount of charr, a tomato sauce that was clearly home made with a strong cheese and basil, I felt like an idiot for only getting one slice. I came back just a year ago and ordered two pies but it was not what I remembered. It might've been the 15 minute car ride that made the crust a bit soggy but the flavor wasn't quite as I remembered either. I would still come back for pizza once in a while though.",9/12/2017,224,15,9,Z-LAlOsIAMh9-CMH2xAsdw

Guys, you have to understand there is one man that makes these OG pies so please be patient. Some loud mouth red head with a snaggle tooth and cheap red lip stick was talking shit about the pizza and the patient patrons who were anticipating this foodie delight, trying to ruin everyone's joy even tho she was waiting for the same pizza.

When we told them we were missing a pizza they said it would be 10 more minutes. 25 minutes later we ended up walking to the window and asking to take it to go. After all that they charged full price for the 2 we got (including the one we had to get up and grab). In the end the pizza was alright but not worth the lousy service or experience.

It's old school, it's done right. Fanfare warranted? You be the judge.There was an incredible moment during my 40 minute wait for a slice:Two young dudes walk in, ask about slices, and are told wait is 25 minutes. They say, ""that's crazy"" and head out. Not disrespectfully, just shocked, and not interested in waiting I suppose. The lady running the show points out that all these people waiting must be crazy then... again, not disrespectful, just pointing out... Then the guy making square pies in the back - who comes out to throw a couple in the oven every now and then - maybe her brother? He points out the possibility that everyone is a little crazy somewhere, somehow, and that there's plenty of room for the possibility that his sister, and those young kids, are both correct. Very cool.Anyway, it's good pizza. Only had a plain round slice, but the nice sauce, freshly grated fresh mozzarella and parmesan, and fresh basil go a long way. The crust was very nice. Simple, good flavor, right amount of char and crispness. Not a floppy NY slice, not a New Haven chew-fest. A proper Brooklyn slice. Understand it. Love it.

552,Jimmy L.,0.0,5,"New York is known for many things. A pizza slice is certainly among one of those things. If you want a real slice, you need to stop by at Di Fara because the pizza here has no competition. Two things makes a great slice: the crust and the sauce. Di Fara's got both these aspects down to a science. Thin crispy crust with a hint of burnt smokiness complimented by just the right amount of sweet and savory sauce. And the cheese, boy that melty cheese puts it right above the rest of the pizzerias. TRY. IT. This is a must.",3/8/2016,0,25,8,sjxJ6JJM6q4YyYNoivmI5Q

This pizza is amazing because each one is given lots of attention, as it should for $30 for plain cheese, but it's with every penny. The crust is so thin it's translucent, and the sauce is chunky and simple, with lots of flavor. The mozzarella is grated by hand from large hunk onto each pizza, then olive oil is tossed on top. Into the oven it goes, getting crispy and blackened around the edges like a good pizza should, then it come out. This is the moment that defines Di Fara, they cut large pieces of fresh basil with scissors on top of every pizza, add a little grated parmesan, and another swish of olive oil.  Every pizza is given lots of love, the customer service was great, and the atmosphere was perfect.

I've tried tons of pizza in the city, but never has this institution been on my radar. They ran out of square slices, so I just got a regular cheese slice. It took ten minutes, which is quick and awesome for a wait. The dough is insane. The crust was out of this world. Nice and airy, but a nice crisp on the edge of the crust. The sauce was so robust, it was everything. Cheese was the perfect amount. Overall, I would have to say this is the best slice I've ever had. Maybe it's just regular to some people, but when you take all three elements of pizza and perfect it simultaneously, it's impressive. Only thing is that I'm a very practical person in every sense of the word, and nothing can justify $5 a slice, especially for that size (I would still go back just for how delicious it is).",4/23/2017,7,74,42,qj2Bs-6n1-rlOp6n6BwrDA

Waiting for the pizza to be made and watching it begin made was lovely. If I was told that I should come back in 3 hrs I wouldn't have an issue. One of them looked at me and my friend who was visiting and said next time learn to plan better. Well, in all honesty if the pizza oven can only hold three pizzas and it takes X amount of time to make one you can figure out how long to tell customers to come back for their pizza rather than saying 1.5hrs to everyone and that not being true. So the two stars are for the gracious gentleman making the pizza. The lack of stars is for the poor attitude of the staff. Disappointed.",12/27/2017,4,36,120,mLEIkQNzH_v1GsKxvZFSMg

577,JayBee R.,0.0,4,"I've been hearing about this place since before it became ""famous"". I was driving by, saw no line, and said, ok, here we go, let's do this. I had to get the square, to compare it to L&B's (which btw, is still good but not as phenomenal as it was 5 or 7 years ago). This square is different. It's not cheese first then sauce, so no comparison can be made. It's a regular, if you will, style square. The crust was a big soggy on one side (no big deal), and very crispy / crunch on the other. Some may find the crust too crispy, but I liked it. The flavor was definitely there. The sauce has a mild, but ""home made"" taste. It's less ""punch in your face"" taste when compared to other pizzerias that also make the sauce in house. Think less tangy, but very pleasant. The cheese was great as well, and of course the basil added a nice touch. While it is definitely a delicious high quality slice with great ingredients, I can't justify the $6 for a square. To be full you would need to eat 2, and that's already $12. I get it. It's a great slice. But I wouldn't travel from NYC just for this. Hipsters made this place into a cult following for no reason. Like they do with everything else. I get it, you come from Wisconsin and you don't have good pizza there.

I ordered a cheese pizza with basil, waited for about 30 mins for them to make it - no big deal as long as it's good I didn't mind the wait. When I brought it home and started eating it, I couldn't believe it. Such an expensive pizza that was totally burnt on the bottom, I was constantly tasting the burnt flavor of the dough. The crust was also a bit heavier than I would have liked. Overall experience - disappointed to spend 30$ on a mediocre pizza.

Having seen it on Huang's World and other programs, I had built this place up as a major destination. Unfortunately, it was mostly a huge disappointment. The pizza was sloppy, hard to eat, and relatively mediocre. Slices come out at random times and extend your lunch in the extremely cramped restaurant. There are probably no more than 10 seats. The line was also disorganized, too. The bottom line is that this place isn't worth the trouble. The pizza isn't awful, but it's definitely the worst I've had in New York City.

It has a very simplistic, classic pizzeria look with just a few seats and tables in the back (btw, no bathrooms). But I didn't come for the ambience.I was able to come on a wednesday afternoon with no lines formed and waited about 40 minutes to get my pie. The plain cheese with half pepperoni to share with one other friend. Pizza was awesome. The biggest highlight was how fresh everything tasted!! Quality ingredients, delicious olive oil, freshly cut basil, straight out of the oven. Also, try their fresh peppers infused with oil, so goood!! The prices are in fact more expensive than other pizzerias but that's because of the higher quality ingredients. For what it's worth, I definitely thought this meal was reasonably priced. The meal costed $31 which can feed 3+ people (in my case, two starving big overeaters), which is actually pretty standard if, if not cheaper when you go to a regular restaurant in nyc.",7/30/2017,79,109,18,YY8RUYtG2QAwhs7MWWU1Cg

600,Joey B.,0.0,4,"Visited Di Fara's on a Friday afternoon ready for some pizza to be in my belly. When we walked up, there was a sign on the door saying that there was no more pizza, but more would be made at 6pm. So, the nice lady at the window got my name and order and told me to be back at 6. Fast forward 2 hours.We got the regular pie- the classic. No toppings, no frills. We just wanted to taste the most simplistic form of their pizza. And it was surprisingly underwhelming. The sauce was A+, cheese was great and the basil leaves tied it all together. However, the thinness of the pizza caused the olive oil to soak through and we had essentially a soggy center of the pizza that affected most of the slices. Now, you see - I gave them 4 stars because I am not delusional. Despite the fact that I said it was underwhelming...They make good pizza. Better than the hyped up Grimaldi's by a landslide. Di Fara's is a must try for pizza connoisseurs. But I'd reconsider if the wait is 2hrs.",7/26/2017,0,8,7,jHi3Uopci0GBSXgUsk7NhQ

605,Jennifer W.,0.0,3,"Had family in town so we decided to come into Brooklyn to try this authentic Nyc Pizza. I imagined this to be a restaurant or something but it was basically just a large kitchen with a standing room area and few chairs. We arrived in Brooklyn around 115 and read a sign out front that said, "" Order at the window."" We waited 10-15 at the window before anyone approached us. The inside was filled up with patrons just standing and a cardboard sign was blocking the door. We ordered and then.... waited. And waited. And waited some more. We waited nearly an hour and a half before we got our pizza. I was so hungry I inhaled the pizza burning my tongue. Look, the pizza is good. But I'm not critique. It's pizza. It didn't change my life. I won't go back because it's too far from Manhattan and a little to long of a wait for even 1 slice of pizza.",4/8/2016Previous review,0,5,0,l2RhLbbbTDSanw2oBZ4KxQ
606,Frank L.,0.0,3,"The only way to properly describe the Difara experience is to compare it to childbirth. After the baby is born, (you get your pizza), The memory of the pain disappears. Yes, the pizza is great but you have to ask yourself a question-do you really want to wait 90 minutes and watch one single person make your pizza and one single person cook your pizza? This place needs to be approached by a business school graduate. He would recommend that they go get a loan, by 12 more pizza ovens, get a much larger location, put five people making the pizzas And five more cooking them, and print up some legible signs so you can see what you are ordering.  If I didn't experience it myself, I would hardly believe it. Since the place is been open since 1965, I would imagine they probably have a paid off Mortgage and an incredibly amazing gross sales record. Why did they insist on running their pizza place as if it's in a town of 350 people on the Outskirts of the Appalachian Mountains? This is a question that only an Indian swami could properly address. There is no possible way that you will ever be able to figure this out. I was stunned by the entire experience. It was like being hazed at a really crappy University and asking yourself why the hell did I let those people do that to me? I don't even like this college! I would give the pizza four stars but as for the rest of the experience, there is no way to indicate .001 stars, so I will just have to leave it at that.",5/18/2018,12,15,0,U_v3BMKCg7JbkwUsyVeLEw

They can fit 4 to 5 pies in one oven.  In my opinion the reason why it takes long:1 - The cheese is grated right in front of you and the toppings are cut to order.  Those 2 items are not pre-made.2 - with only 1 oven they squeeze 4 to 5 pies at a time.  If they had more ovens the wait will most likely be shorter.Would I go back again?  Yes, if I happen to be in the area and the wait is not as long or I find something else to do and come back when I think my order is ready.",2/6/2017,3,43,19,zntoKlD8dSHhXx7yzQ7a3w

I grew up on Sally's and Pepe's in New Haven, so I often see many of the NYC pizzerias as above average but not on the same level. Di Fara, on the other hand really gives Sally's a run for its money. You're going to wait an hour if you come here on a busy evening. Maybe even two I've heard. Come planning to spend your night in the area or something. People wait in line for food for a reason. If you're not patient, then Di Fara will not be right for you.Di Fara looks like it hasn't changed anything about itself in all it's years open. The decor is archaic and the ordering process is as inefficient as I've ever seen one. The artisan makes every single pie by hand, without any help, so it takes a while. Don't focus on service or decor. Just focus on pizza.We got 1 Red and 1 White pie.  Unlike most pizza places, Di Fara didn't have pre-selected customizations. We choose to get a margherita for red and a wild onion pizza for white. The red pie was smothered with a peppery oil and was fantastic. The white pie was covered in the most amazing and flavorful wild onions and was easily the best onion pizza I've had.

I looked around to make sure I was at the right place. Yup--it said Di Fara. The exterior showed its age as well as the interior -quite small-ish and dressed with a few table/chairs). Nothing fancy or trendy about it.With the exception of a few people hanging around eating their pizza, I asked ""where's the line?"" and was informed that they used to be closed on Tuesday and some people aren't aware. And--the notorious lengthy lines usually take place end of week/ weekend.  Not that I was complaining or disappointed not to wait on a line. Once at the counter, I ordered a slice and it was served upon request.I sat down, looked it over---took a bite. Oh my, I thought to myself--this was definitely worth the trip. The entire combination, dough/crust, sauce, cheese, spices/basil were indescribable. It was really delicious. Mind you, the owner had the day off so Robert (who is Asian!) was making the pizza that day. He's been with Di Fara for 2 years.Still hungry, I went for a 2nd slice but had to wait for the pie to come out of the oven momentarily. Once it did, I asked for a larger slice from the pie but instead of switching slices, Robert cut half from another (I thought that was really nice--as it was really like getting 1 1/2 slices at that point).Anyway, the 2nd slice was less than perfect in comparison to the first slice (boo hoo). It was a little bit too crispy with no bend to it at all. As in, I'm worried for my teeth kind of crispiness. Hence, I was kind of disappointed (maybe a lot).My review for the first slice is 5 stars but for the second, I'm going to have to say 4.  As I looked around at others eating their pizza, I saw that their slices were the perfect slices I had eaten with my first.I definitely want to return again because it's just that good.Overall rating 4.5 based on great pizza and for Robert being so generous with the extra half slice of pizza.",9/26/2017,505,591,1730,ErEf2Xr-1qF1JAB-u9lwjg

However, you could get lucky (I have) and walk in, order, and then someone else not pick up their pie and get it quickly. But seriously, you're going to have to wait. 3. Order it on the phone, tell them when you're going to pick up the pizza, then take the train out and pick it up. Just trust me on this. Yes, you can walk in, but you're going to have to wait.

641,Mike C.,1.0,2,"Pizza snobs and people born in Brooklyn need to calm down, this place is really not so great.I went once a year ago and was thoroughly unimpressed. After constantly hearing about how this is one of the greatest slices ever, I knew I had to try it. Since I always hear about extremely long wait times here, I was ecstatic when I stopped by late on a Sunday night and was able to get a slice almost immediately.I think it must've been that they had a few slices left over from an old pie, because they gave us a few lukewarm square slices that were surprisingly ordinary. The slices were soaked in WAY too much oil, so the cheese was all completely sliding off into a big sloppy pool of oil, alongside some soggy crust. And I paid $5 for that slice.Strike 1.Over the past year, I've endured seeing this place featured on several more lists of not only the best pizza in NY, but the entire country. Bewildered, I figured I must be missing something, so I went to try it again, this time going for a regular slice (also a ridiculous $5 each).I arrived late on Saturday after the lunch rush (3 PM) hoping it would be an off time, only to find the place completely packed. I wrestled my way to the front around the several people waiting for pies, and was surprised to hear that it would only be 30 minutes for 2 slices (which is way too long but not too bad for this precious place). Luckily we were driving so I occupied myself with Strutting and gettin some out of the way tiles while waiting (check out strutapp.com).Anxious not to miss the pie, we got there promptly, only to enjoy waiting an additional 45 minutes. So in total, about an hour and 15 minutes. For two slices of pizza. For $5 each.Yeah, the pizza is pretty good. The crust is thin and super crispy. I don't get why he needs to put on that extra oil though, as it just gets to be way too much pooling up in there. Also, there is a good inch and a half of pure crust at the top, which no cheese or sauce or anything. There are just a few tables in the overcrowded little spot, too, so you most likely have to eat your slice on the go. Also, it's really oily, so get plenty of napkins.I would say this is a place you maybe come once just so you can tell pizza snobs they're wrong and it's not so good. I would just drive a little further south to Totonno's in Coney Island if you want some very hyped pizza that's actually worth it.Strike 2. And I think 3, too.

644,Mr. P.,0.0,5,"I visited NY and this place was a must visit. After coming from the Empire state building I took the Q train and rode it to Ave J station. Once I got to street level it was about 100 feet away. No line as I walked up to the take out window. I look inside and I see the legend himself Mr. Dom DeMarco making pizza! I was stoked as just recently he had cut down on the time he works at the pizzeria. I ordered the Di Fara special pie (topped with sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions). I watched Dom make it and 25 mins later it was boxed up. I had to take it on the train and was worried the fresh aroma of the pie would cause a stir. I successfully got back to the hotel and still warm ate half the pie. Saved the other half for my buddy as he was eager to try as well.

Last time we went we could not sit inside because the family had decided to turn the tiny, dirty shop into a reservation/Private party only place. You have to order take out through the window. Understand that if you've traveled there and do not live in the area, there is no where to sit and eat anywhere nearby. This is an ultra orthodox neighborhood with not a bench in sight. You will eat standing up on the street like a hobo after spending $30 on a pie! What was a small, neighborhood restaurant became nothing more than an overpriced tourist trap and DeMarco has the balls to say in an interview ""I am Brooklyn."" It's a joke. Yeah, in that you're overrated and expensive like the rest of the boro. Don't bother going here. On weekends you can wait in line with the Jersey crowd and other out of towners.

647,Joanna V.,1.0,2,"OK. So this pizza is fine. But it is truly nothing special. My husband and I are doing our very own pizza tour of NYC and we've been trying all the greats: Lucali, Totonno's, Deninno's, Grimaldi's, Juliana's, etc. This, my friend, is not one of the greats. This has got to be the best example of the classic, ""this places gets hyped so much so now everyone must go here."" My husband and I went at an off time so we wouldn't have to wait forever for pizza. We got 4 regular slices and had to wait about 10 minutes. There were plenty of people waiting around outside of Di Fara's for their pies. When I opened the box, I thought to myself, ""hmm this basically looks like dollar slice."" When I took a bite, I thought to myself, ""hmm this tastes exactly like dollar slice."" This crust is thin and crispy, there is barely an sauce to speak of, pools and rivers of grease will stream off each slice and burn your hands and mouth, the cheese was so over cooked and there didn't appear to be much. I just don't see the appeal. And each regular slice cost $5. A whole regular pie is $28. If you want toppings, much more. Lucali, which to me is the gold standard, is a FAR tastier and less expensive option. Even Grimaldi's is cheaper than this place and makes a pie that is of superior quality. I get the whole schtick of Dominick is the only one who makes the pies and hans't changed the way he makes them in 40 years. But, my friends, this is just not worth it. Let the man retire already. This is not even located in a part of Brooklyn where you would think prices would be through the roof. I was so absolutely underwhelmed with DI Fara.

651,Ben L.,1.0,3,"I am a sucker for NYC history and I have a special place in my heart for the elderly. I also, really appreciate the fact that Domenico DeMarco, who at almost 80, makes every single pie from scratch. EVERY SINGLE PIE! He cranks out anywhere between 100-150 pies a day. In the front window, you can see basil, chiles and other herbs they grow in house. With that said, I think $5 a slice/square is insane. I appreciate that the pies are made by a pizza master but pizza is cheap. Also, the wait is absurd. A regular was an hour and a square was an hour and a half. The line of people in front was kinda weird waiting for just pizza. I guess I am used to pizza being a quick in and out thing, especially in New York. I guess waiting for a Cronut wouldn't be so bad...The food:Square- The square was nice. The bottom had a nice thick crunchy bottom. The sauce was nice but I was expecting a very pronounced sauce. The cheese and basil were nice as well. But an hour and half wait for a $5 squares is not worth it. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Regular- It's weird when I saw the regular in front of me, I already knew I was going to be disappointed. The crust was dry and the cheese and sauce were runny, runny to the point where everything would fall off the slice if I turned it on it's side. The regular was also salty, the basil was nice though.

I can only chalk it up to the story of the Emperor's Clothes.Don't get me wrong - the pizza is good, but it's not the best. It's definitely not worth waiting over an hour for and definitely not worth the inflated prices in Brooklyn. This place is making a killing just riding the hype wave. Has anyone ever thought - geez, I hope this guy can retire and enjoy the rest of his life and fortune? People just poke their heads and cameras into that tiny order window (the dining area was closed when I went due to the heat) and take pictures of the owner like he's some sideshow.

661,Israel P.,0.0,5,I'm coming from Florida just to eat this pizza that everyone has been talking about for years I finally made the trip to eat at this historical amazing establishment. I had about or regular pizzas they were around $5 each and a Pepsi. The crust was nice and thin crispy but I'm little chewy above the bottom layer making it well-balanced. The sauce was just how a pizza size should be and the mozzarella was very fresh. The company is on top of the regular pizza non cooked just raw basil leaves and which I think is better than having it cooked with the pizza at the same time. The place is old so don't expect it to be super clean and organized they have around three tables with some chairs that can easily be filled up. The place is always full and the wait time for justice Live Scan average around 15 to 20 minutes. When I order my slices it took around 30 minutes to finish but just at miring the old man making the pizza and enjoying the environment and Brooklyn it was worth the wait. Make sure to bring cash because they don't accept any form of debit or credit cards.

The crust is extremely crispy and has a light ""gassy"" flavor to it.  I wouldn't say it helps or hurts the pizza.  But man that grease...I also had a square slice, and it came out a bit soggy on the bottom.  The cheese was delicious, but I'd still recommend the regular slice.  IMO, it better delivers that true, stand-out, Di Fara experience.  Prices are quite hefty, but I'd say it's definitely worth it.  I've tried pizza throughout the city, and this place definitely gives, if nothing else, a rare, unique pizza experience that I haven't found elsewhere.",6/30/2018,4,38,0,UZ0LpQrUB90zYVUS0P4dlQ

668,Con S.,0.0,4,"I walked past Mr.DeMarco's place for decades figuring it was just another local pizza parlor.  If you wonder why are food critics and the internet going ape over this place the past few years, it may just be nostalgia for authenticity and consistency in any craft.  Before pizza became the commercial chain store system it is today, every commercial block of stores had a place like DiFara, and like Katz's deli on Houston St, very little has changed - there in lies the charm of it all, and the reason for it's premium price.  So many classic family run stores have been pushed out of business by high volume low price chain competition and sky high commercial space rents, so I guess in a way the hype around DiFara's is what saved it from closing into obscurity long ago, and checked shirt Mr.DeMarco honors that appreciation by coming in every day, still making the same pies he made decades ago when nobody but the locals knew about his place, and will still give you smile between pie making while things are not too hectic.  comparing his pizza to a commercial chain pie; DiFara's is moistened with a bit more olive oil, the dough has a better chew without dry or burnt spots, the sauce is not sickly sweet and cheese quantity does not overwhelm.  does that justify a $5/slice price, maybe not as lots of neighborhoods still have their own young hand crafted $3/slice DiFara wannabees - but when you consider your grandfather got his slice from a place exactly like this, then maybe it's good to occasionally support before Mr.DeMarco's health forces him to retire, and the building owner has to replace this corner store with yet another Starbucks to earn the rent - hell, I still think people are crazy to spend $5 on a cup of coffee, so why not do it on a really good slice.",12/31/2017,0,55,5,pgEnqMm96qdGA-JW5GTBYA

674,Angela D.,1.0,5,"The craziest place in New York City, hands down. But you know it is good when New Yorkers stand in line for up to an hour PATIENTLY (without loud sighs, without snarky comments, etc.) before even getting to speak to the Pizza Master to place an order. Those in the know, do this. Those that come hungry or don't know how it works, get frustrated and leave. That's better for the rest of us! Haha!Seriously, the first time we came here (thank god we weren't hungry) we could not believe how long it was taking to get to the counter to place our order. Even once at the counter it took an eternity before the Pizzaiolo even looked at us. Before that, we were just puzzled and after about 30 minutes of waiting in line a couple ahead of us got fed up, cursed the place and left. We looked around to see the reactions of others and there was nothing. No one paid any attention to the outburst. So we figured, ok, we just have to endure. The pizza must be THAT good.And it is. Jibbers Crabst, this pizza is to die for! I love the Sicilian pizza for its decadence. The Pizzaiolo actually pulls the pans out of the oven with his fingers! The crust is oily and tastes like absolute heaven.Watching the pizza making is part of the fun. You see the master at work and interestingly, he doesn't seem willing to let his son do anything more than provide the chopped toppings. He shapes the dough, ladles the sauce on, adds three types of cheese, bakes it, cuts fresh basil, and throws parmiggiano cheese on top. Fascinating. And when you finally get to place your order, and you know the one he is working on is yours, you go into a sort of trance. Your anticipation becomes nearly unbearable as he pulls pizzas out of the oven and you just know you will be able to eat yours soon. Finally, yours is out of the oven, he tosses the parm on top, cuts it into eight beautiful slices, and hands you the box. Now you carry it to the nearest table and devour it. Unbearable yet unbelievably satisfying experience with a cheesy pizza ending that never disappoints.The only problem as I see it is that we may not be able to enjoy this for much longer - The Pizza Master Mr. DeMarco is in his 70s.

676,Priti K.,1.0,4,"So after years of saying I'd do it, I finally did it. We took the trip to Midwood and tried one of NYC's best pizzas! We got there a little after 6pm on Sunday. There were a few people ahead of us and Dom was taking a break in the back. They were only doing Take Out because he was tired and didn't want to open the store. We waited about 35 minutes for our large margherita pie and 4 squares. Now on any normal day, I'd choose a thin NY slice over sicilian, but I was totally taken aback by a DiFara's sausage square. Delectable. The bottom was crispy, not overdone with butter and oil. Enough cheese, and the sausage phenomenal. LOVED. The regular margherita was great, although for me not quite perfect. Amazing flavor, much saltier than the square.The sauce is unique, I can't put my finger on it. The greatest part is the ton of fresh basi; it makes such a difference!You can watch every pizza being made. Yes, you'll have to be patient. If I was in the area, I'd be here all the time. Is it worth the trek? You need to decide for yourself. This pizza is fantastic and lovers will definitely enjoy it. Those who come to analyze their business model might be annoyed.SO LUCKY - five minutes before our pizzas were ready, they randomly opened up shop for us to sit. Life is like a box o' pizzas.

There's a point where you get some efficiencies, and that point needs to be a long time ago.Ok, enough of the complaining. This pizza was AWESOME. I strongly recommend you eat here if a) you're about to leave the country and won't have pizza for several weeks, or b) want to quit pizza cold turkey. Why? Because nothing will compare to it.

But there are other places in Brooklyn far better for far less money.

It's OK.  Nice crispy crust, subtle and tangy good sauce, but overall not amazing enough for the wait.  It's overrated! They're humble people working at this place, but Yelpers should give them a break and let them cook pizza without stressing over the long lines and people abandoning their pizza orders because of the wait.  Maybe their pizza will actually be fresher then.",9/5/2016,2,19,31,30VgDamsUcHaXawr35K0kg
685,Jax O.,0.0,5,"It's like sensory overload for a true pizza lover, stepping into the hallowed walls of this Brooklyn institution. Di Fara is one of a kind; all pies are painstakingly handcrafted by the master pizza maker himself, Dom Demarco. If he doesn't show up to work, there is no pizza. When he dies, so will Di Fara. His pies are an extension of himself; they reflect the love and respect he has for the food and it's evident upon first bite.You will watch as he carefully presses the dough into a perfect round, then almost sensually applies the tomato sauce and tucks it in under a blanket of the highest quality mozzarella, finishing with a simple drizzle of olive oil before it hits the hot oven. It may not seem like much, but it creates something magical.Each slice of DiFara pizza is crispy, creamy, savory and sweet. The fresh basil he clips on to each pie when it is ready to serve adds a lively, herbaceous finish to the rich and wonderful pie below. There is no other way to describe it besides pure perfection. Come get a pie with some friends, do yourself the favor while you have a chance.

To the pizza: I wanted a square and a regular piece but they were done with the squares for the day so I got 2 regular.This is literally melt in your mouth pizza -oily, not too much cheese or sauce (which usually for me the more cheese the better but not in this case).

692,Charley K.,1.0,4,"I really, really, REALLY want to rate this place 5 stars, but the wait and the asterisks (e.g., odd hours, high prices, tight seating) are too numerous to ignore. As per hype, it is definitely one of the best pizzas in NYC, but definitely not the best pizza dining experience.Let's get the bad out of the way first. The hours are very weird - Di Fara is flat out closed Mondays and Tuesdays, and I don't think it even opens until 12pm. The place at best seats 20, and we're talking fold-up chairs and low tables. The pizza is also very expensive - $5 slices, $28+ pies - but does take into account the premium ingredients, all of which I think are imported from Italy. Aaaaand worst of all, the wait. At MINIMUM, assume you will wait for 30 minutes per pie in a cramped, hot pizzeria. After arriving on a Thursday around 12:50pm, we put in our order of one pie (a mistake, but I'll get to that later) and proceeded to wait...for OVER 90 minutes! Considering the poor seating, that definitely was a buzzkill for us.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I can move on to the good which is the godsend pizza. Being able to watch owner and master chef Dom hand craft each of these pies is an honor and a privilege. Ripped up chunks of fresh mozzarella, drizzled olive oil, crumbles of fennel sausage, red onion, and sausage - these all come together beautifully on the DiFara classic pie. After each pie comes fresh out the oven, DiFara sprinkles Parmesan and cut up basil on each pie. I can safely say that almost NO other pizzeria will put this much effort and attention into each pie like they do here. With every bite, you can taste the gooey cheese, rich tomato sauce, and crispy crust come together in beautiful harmony that only homegrown food can provide. My biggest regret is that we ordered one pie for four, not two. (Although I was so frustrated with the party of 4 before us who ordered three pies. That order alone probably added 30min to our wait!) The pizza is incredible, and DiFara deserves its status as a BK institution, but the wait is too unpleasant to guarantee 5 stars from me.",7/7/2015,95,307,0,ZeXaLOPR5S4BXoMU9phTOw

694,Kevin K.,1.0,2,"So there's this thing about being a New Yorker - we are surrounded by decent pies.   Like your neighborhood Vinnie's?  $2.75/slice .  Cheap?  $1 slice from 99 cent fresh or 2 Brothers.  Fancy pants with a history?  Patsy's, Lombardi's, Totonno's.  Sit-down joints with tablecloths/waiter service, standards of the city, $24/pie.  Pizza is like sex - even bad ones should be good.  In this case however, it's sex in a dirty cathouse with celebrity names plastered all over, 2+ hour wait, insufferable crowds, silicone and parlor tricks, all those people ranting and raving about its quality/authenticity seemingly violated some oath of abstinence just to bust a nut here.Don't get it?  For your discernment:Exhibit A: The sign on the door.  ""Sorry for the wait, but it's worth it"".  This is a symbol of business entitlement which tells you they don't have to take your shit, and the lack of courtesy towards their patrons extends to all aspects of their operation.  40 minute subway ride and need to pee?  No restrooms.  Tired?  No seats or a place to lean on.  The real blood boiler is when someone gets half their order and feels entitled to sit there and wait until the other half shows up...between now and 30 minutes from now.  Local joint with the $2.75/slice?   $5/slice (almost double the NYC average for a not-very-big-slice).  The place hasn't been renovated since 1965, and filthy?  ""It's part of the charm"". There is a 2+ hour line out the door, a shit-show order tracking system, and the crowd looks pissed?   ""Don't like it, get out"".  What can you use to justify the price, the decor AND the wait?  You can't clean/fix the place up, install restrooms, and make it takeout only?  If someone tosses out the words ""authentic"", ""traditional"" or that ""timewarp to the past"" cliche to excuse this, I'll show you the interior of Totonno's (gruff but clean and features restrooms), and you can go fuck yourself.  They are failing customer respect 101, and you are enabling it.Exhibit B:The people on that line - they look suspiciously out of place in Midwood on a late Saturday afternoon.  They seem to think that it's a badge of honor to be treated like cattle, and to pass it forward, due of some lost-in-translation interpretation of the ""Noo Yorka"" stereotype.  Real New Yorkers are gruff, resilient and streetwise, but we have built-in filters.  We do have to put up with 8 million other people daily, and some of them are certifiably crazy.  Here -  they don't care.  It's almost like they are trying to ""out-Brooklyn"" each other in some attempt to get their pies faster.  Think of it as DiFara's sycophantic auto-immune system.  Exhibit C:The pizza isn't really unique or a major breakthrough to warrant the accolades.  Okay, pizzas are simple things (not to be conflated with easy).  The differentiator between good and great is the quality of the crust.  A great pie is done in an extra hot oven so it'll will cook faster and do less damage to the flavor of the ingredients, and the crust crisp up more - your typical oven can't usually hit those heights.  Here they use a modified oven so it'll crank higher than the usual, but without proper upkeep it'll be inconsistent and burn pies (which happen frequently here).  It's true that Dom hand-toss the dough, cut the fresh basil, and then douse the pie once more in oil...but that's just a slightly burnt pie with basil.  Nothing unique about the sauce, nothing eye opening about the cheese, the crust is obtainable somewhere else.  This ""quality"" is not hard to find, and you won't have to waste a Saturday afternoon waiting for it.  If the cliche is ""Dom still got it"" my response would be ""Yes, just like Lombardi's, except much slower, more anal retentive, filthy kitchen and poor customer respect to boot"". If you grew up eating Pizza Hut or Dominos out in Indiana or Arizona, sure, it's like licking the baby jesus.  If you ate local Vinnie's in New Jersey, this place can be a treat.  But if you had stuff from the NYC standards (all just a subway ride away), they all serve comparable pies minus the inflated price ($35/pie), the wait, the filth or the sense of entitlement.Someone got the idea that Dom the hardworking barehanded geriatric pizza flipper somehow made this place better than the rest simply because of the old-world-perfectionist narrative, and that because of it, this is the nexus of NYC pizza authenticity.  Well, I am here as a native New Yorker to tell you that no, it's not.  It's just an old tightwad with OCD slinging out the same pie slowly since the 1960s.  It's not a James Beard culinary achievement.  It might be on all the guidebooks, but the return-on-time-investment is extremely poor.  Go there once if you must, but do not make the mistake of a repeat visit.  You waited 3 hours and spent double the usual, and the result isn't justified.  You would have to pull an emperor has no clothes at this point.   Welcome to the pizza world equivalent of the $30 tourist hot dog.",5/5/2015,83,271,3067,EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw

The Sicilian square pie I had was $38 and it came with sausage, spinach, peppers, onions and mushrooms. It was 12 slices in total, that's basically $3 a slice!!!

I have read in several articles online that they use buffalo mozzarella but that is not true. Maybe years ago they did but as of when I went in 2016 and 2017 they do not. I did not taste the buffalo mozz and I  clearly watched the pizza being made. They use a block mozzarella and a dusting of grana padana (which is good). $30 for a pie when you aren't using high quality mozzarella is excessive. Dom does go too heavy on the oil in my opinion which results in a very oily pizza. That being said, everything does come together and it does taste good. The crust was thin and crisp and the tomatoes have a nice tang to them. The fresh basil is a nice addition and the grana padana adds great flavor.

We order 2 big pies and 2 hrs later after chatting we got to try the pizza! Worth the wait and would do it again!,2/23/2017,69,4,4,hYSH7s3ZXeFCJG1KWQLcmw
713,James H.,0.0,3,"How do I write this review?On the one hand, you have to pay homage to the artisan that is Domenico. Banging out pie after pie for 25 years is no small feat. Doing it at his age with an almost fetishistic attention to each pie is worthy of admiration. On the other hand, you have to be evaluate food objectively, since after all, this is the very purpose of writing a food review, no?The pizza was okay. Honestly, it was very mediocre. I got a square pie with pepperoni and garlic. Then I got a regular slice just to make sure I wasn't missing anything. The square pie was a mess. It had so much sauce on it that I mentioned to my wife that I felt like I was eating tomato soup on a flatbread. It was unmanageable. The crust was falling apart and the sauce was spilling onto my hands, onto my table, onto the tray. The area around my tray looked like a crime scene. There was red sauce EVERYWHERE. The sauce itself was largely unremarkable, but the cheese was quite good. The pepperoni was crispy and the garlic was chunky and plentiful. Problem is that they were swimming in sauce. No bueno. The regular slice was A-okay. Seriously. There's better slices in Manhattan. No need to make the trek. I wouldn't come here again 1) due to the fact that it is in Winterfell, 2) because I think $35 for a pizza is not cool. However, I would say that anyone looking to rank NYC pizzas should make a visit. Why? Because Di Fara's is an institution and whether you like it or not, you should make a decision for yourself after experiencing it first hand. Over and out.",11/5/2017,10,34,17,Uvmi-YEBQCXlDdHWzPYuww

It was amazing, and I remember it fondly.I came back today with a friend visiting from abroad, and I was so excited. We waited the hour for the pizza, but then the guy told us it was coming right up. It didn't. After another 15 minutes, I was getting really annoyed and saw that he was giving to people who had ordered about 20 minutes after me. He finally gave us the pizza, and I was hoping it would make up for the wait. It didnt. I'm not sure if the quality was deteriorated over time, or whether coming back I've experienced better pizza, but meh. It was just meh pizza for $30.",11/3/2017,688,413,686,W-8nzvd9WQXoEg4---44Wg

716,Joey I.,0.0,5,"I've been to the best pizza places in some of the most famous pizza cities in the world: New York, Chicago, Rome, Baltimore (bonus points if you can figure out which one is out of place). This is the best slice of pizza I've ever had. The old guy who makes the pizzas is apparently a legend who makes every pie himself. While that's cute in theory, there's a reason Henry Ford isn't famous for making every car he sold lovingly by hand. The process results in each pizza being MAGICAL and taking about as much time to make as  an average four mile run - and don't worry, he only does one at a time. Two and a half hours after we got there (we were FIFTH in line, which you may recognize as ""35 seconds from being served at McDonald's""), we finally got to eat. The final judgment? Best pizza pie I've ever eaten. Each ingredient tasted like it been hand chosen by a professional pizza maker to achieve maximum deliciousness, which is both an unbelievably accurate comparison and why I'm not a professional writer. I left feeling like pizza had been ruined for the next few weeks, which it actually was. Great job, maybe work on the process or don't show up hungry. Also, you can walk around the neighborhood while you wait, so my planning left a lot to be desired. But I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a great pizza and isn't planning on having any more in the next few weeks.",11/15/2015,2,17,3,6MnYnOvTlLh4yFpW23e4NA
717,Daniel W.,1.0,5,"Di Fara is the godfather of pizza. I am honored to have been able to try probably one of the greatest pies in the world. Just the fact that he makes each and every pizza shows how much he cares about making phenomenal pies. I am still finding an excuse to make a trip back to NY for the sole purpose of getting Di Fara's.I made a trek out here on a weekday right after work. I arrived around 4:45ish and the doors were open but ""roped"" off. It was my lucky day though...a lady, I'm guessing one of Di Fara's daughters, came over to me and told me they were closed but that she would be glad to take my order for when they reopen. I was blown away because she offered to make whatever pizzas I wanted...my eyes lit up in disbelief and I said back to her, ""wait...so you're telling me I can choose the next 4 pizzas that Di Fara is going to make?"" She replied with a laughing smile, ""yes."" I felt a little overwhelmed at first from the excitement but I gathered myself and decided on a regular cheese slice, pepperoni, the grandma's slice with sausage and mushroom, and a grandma's slice with just cheese...(lay off I was starving!) After ordering, I walked around the area just trying to find things to do to keep my mind off the greatness that was to come. I got back in line at about 6:00pm and there were about 5 people ahead of me. But little did they know that Di Fara was in there making the next 4 pies for me. . The line got to about 30 deep. Finally, the gates of heaven opened up, the heavenly music was playing, and I see God himself, Mr. Di Fara, trimming the fresh basil onto my pies. (That actually would be my ideal heaven...Di Fara just making pies for me) 1) The cheese slice - cheese combination was amazing. Crust was cooked to perfection. Not cracker-like, not too chewy, and NOT wet. The best part was the sauce. The tomato sauce is so good and refreshing even. And the fresh basil on top just sealed the deal.2) Pepperoni - very interesting. Never seen this type of pepperoni before. They look like little cups or suction cups. I like them better than the normal flat/thin pepperoni slices b/c they have more flavor and are actual chunks of pepperoni vs. thin slices. 3) Grandma slices - Same quality of the other cheeses and sauces. The tomato sauce is perfect. Not too sweet but very tasty. The blends of cheeses just melt in your mouth. And the best part, the CRUST! I preferred the grandma slices because I loved the crusts. The crusts were cooked perfectly. Almost looked burned but tasted amazing with a slight charred taste that I like. Next time I am getting a whole pie. Wait, make that 4 whole pies...I'm a man of my word.I was truly in my own world enjoying these slices. And I felt so bad for the other people just waiting in line just salivating, waiting for their turn to take a bite of heaven. Great service. Smaller joint so I dunno if I would recommend coming here for a nice sit down dinner. A+++ in my book and for sure my favorite. Since then, I have recommended this place to anybody I know that is in NY. I can die peacefully now knowing that I have had Di Fara's.Mr. Di Fara, I would be more than willing to drop my job and be an apprentice for you just to learn the ways and continue making pizzas the Di Fara way!!

720,Kristine D.,1.0,4,"DiFara's offers an excellent pizza. Handmade everyday by Dom himself! We've always ordered the round pie as opposed to the square pie. Each pizza is topped with fresh basil that he cuts with scissors himself and a generous drizzle of olive oil.I advise arriving just before they open to have a shot at a short wait. Otherwise, you can typically expect a solid 1.5-2 hour waits. The first time I came, I waited just over 2 hours and the second time, I waited just over 3 hours, which was a tougher wait. We had to go around the corner and order a sandwich just to get us through the longer wait (also owned by DiFara's).Also, you'll notice that they have very limited seating - 19 seats to be exact. If they had 20 seats, they would legally need to have a customer bathroom available. Since they don't, they can only offer 19 seats, which means you'll have to stand and wait in this small pizzeria. In terms of a bathroom, I was able to use one down the block at Rite Aid. With the long wait, you're bound to have to wander around looking for a facility since DiFara's can't offer one.The pizza is delicious and tastes wonderful. However, it's 2.5 hours wonderful. Anything beyond that makes me crabby. After my second visit turned into a 3.5 hour wait, I was pretty over it. I'm certainly glad I've tried it but I don't know if I'll be doing the wait again.

I mean how could such a good slice of pizza be so close to home and I never knew about it? it's probably just a hipster mecca."" Okay. It's not a hipster mecca. People who stood on line in the cold for two hours? Those people are serious about their pizza. And let me tell you it's worth it. This is NOT a pizza that disappears into the multitude of other pizzas where you can't really tell one from the other. I will ALWAYS remember a Di Fara pizza. The crust is thin and CRUNCHY. The pizza has the most perfect ratio of cheese and sauce I've ever encountered, I'm not kidding! You look at it and it doesn't look like much. And then you bite into it and you realize why THIS pizza is worth two hours in the cold and others are barely worth a look.  There's something really special that goes into this sauce. Other pizza places try to make their sauces better with sugar. This one doesn't. It relies on the actual flavors of the ingredients that go into the pizza. As someone who loves to cook because of flavors and who considers herself a real foodie, I can honestly say that the pizza is fantastic. There is also an appetizer of pasta fagioli (I hope I spelled that right).  It. Is. Divine. Seriously, don't forego the pasta fagioli. The staff is incredibly courteous and pleasant and the inside of the restaurant can get full sometimes but others it's quiet and peaceful while you're enjoying your well earned pizza.

725,Hannah H.,1.0,4,"It has been however many years since I've been trying to go to Di Fara, but it never worked out - until, at last, on our recent trip, we were able to make our way out there!   Owned by Mr. Domenico DeMarco (also known as 'Dom'), he immigrated to NY from Italy back in '59.  Most of his family members were bakers and master pizziaolos, and when he first arrived to the States, he worked as a farmer; eventually, in '64, he opened Di Fara Pizza.  The menu offers pizza slices (regular, square, with topping, or with specialty topping), pizza pies (regular pie, square pie, or the DiFara Classic Pie (with sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and onions), and calzones.  Toppings selection include: sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, garlic, black olives, meatballs, anchovies, peppers, artichokes, porcini mushrooms, green olives, baby eggplant, broccoli rabe, prosciutto, sun-dried roasted peppers, sun-dried tomato, and semi-dried cherry tomatoes.  When we arrived (very convenient off, literally right across from the Q), there was already a line, but not too long.  I just put in an order of one Square slice of pepperoni and garlic, requested a 'corner' piece, and waited for about 1.5 hours.  Now, I didn't mind waiting, as I was just so happy that I was finally able to try this place out.  I've noticed that other larger parties ordered either a small or a large square, which I will probably do, as I saw one that was extra well-done, and it literally came out sizzling (had similar toppings as me) - it looked AMAZING.  When I was finally able to try mine, I found it to be pretty tasty!  I wished I requested it to be extra well-done (which I usually do), but I think I got too excited and couldn't think straight T___T  Either way, the dough was nice and crispy, nonetheless, and held the toppings well - the ingredients were quite generous - copious amounts of pepperoni and fresh garlic that you can actually taste, and I loved the chunky tomato sauce that tasted oh-so-fresh!  Loved that!  I also loved the automatic additions of the basil and the olive oil - definitely adds that extra pizazz!  I loved how Mr. Dom was there, assembling the pizza, cutting the fresh basil, drizzling olive oil, checking the temperature, checking the baking progress in the oven, and transferring it onto the tray for the patrons to chow down.  The restaurant itself is small (only seats 19 (and, yes, I counted the number of chairs :P  There are only 3 tables as well, so expect to share space!).  I'd love to come back again, but this time, I would order a whole Square pie, extra well-done, and gobble up them corner pieces :D  Also, don't be shy in asking for chili flakes as well as Parm cheese - the guy who takes the order is very generous in his pourings (also very nice and very efficient!).  I thanked Mr. Dom on my way out, and he gave me such a sweet smile and a wave - HEART HEART HEART.  Definitely check Di Fara out :D+seeing Mr. Dom in action :D  Heart heart heart!+Square pizza - pepperoni and garlic; extra well-done (corner pieces will be fought over!)+automatic addings of basil and olive oil :D+lovely chunky tomato sauce :D+19 seats, 3 tables; sharing will be inevitable+across from Q station",1/20/2015,546,4059,30496,GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w

728,Sheldon Y.,0.0,2,"Been a long time since I had a slice at De Fara. I had a MD's app't and was across the street so I decided to get a slice. From across the street the store looked like it was out of business, the place looked uncared for and the gates were about 1/2 way up. It turned out the store was open. There were 2 customers inside. The interior didn't look much better then the outside. Dominick was not there but his daughter was and a guy who made the pizza's. She said her father was at home and I am not sure if he still actually makes pizza's anymore. The slice I had has been described by a number of disappointed reviewers and they are spot on. The slice was $5 and a good size. The crust was dried out and somewhat burned. There was very little cheese. There was a good deal of tomato sauce but it was exceptionally spicy, which I found to be barely edible. My advice is if you go there and Dominick is not there turn and leave. If you want to take a trip CALL first  and ask if Dominick is making the pizza, if not save yourself a disappointing trip. It may be possible that Dominick still mystically transforms the ingredients into the transcendent tasting pizza that has been reviewed as NY City's best over the years. I was there at a lunch time hour and it was obvious people were staying away. It appears something not good has happened to a once great pizza place.

741,J C.,0.0,4,"A Brooklyn institution, but I only recommend going once if you're far away and if the commute is long for you. The kind of expectations you will have built up in your mind, will no doubt be too high, especially if you need to take several trains or you wind up standing in line for hours. No pizza can live up to that kind of hype. You would pretty much have to be lying to yourself to think pizza was worth spending half your day just to wrap your lips around a slice. It's very good pizza, if your wait was 30 minutes and you drove 20 minutes and found parking just down the block, then that would be a more accurate and healthy expectation ratio. If you come away with maddening disappointment, don't blame the guy or his pizza for your inability to regulate or ground your own expectations in a realistic manner.If I were to be honest, it was hard not to be swept up in some of the nostalgia while there, but watching him painfully make each pie, was tough to see, especially now he is getting much older. Plus, the camera crew that was there, made the experience a little more chaotic, and has kept me away. I like to eat my food in peace.I hope one day he can retire on an island somewhere without any annoying people with camera phones. That would be my dream for Di Fara.

Despite the long wait for a pie (at least 40 min), it truly is a special experience watching Dom delicately make each pie in front of you. The sauce is carefully spread on the fluffy pizza dough while each topping is put on the pizza one by one. I know everyone is in a rush nowadays, but this is one of those moments worth waiting for. Tips:- IMPORTANT: This place actually stops taking orders AT LEAST an hr before closing as each pizza takes a while to make. Arrive BEFORE 8pm to guarantee an order!- Regular pie ($28), Square pie ($32)- Best cheese pizza ever. Recommend getting the cheese on a regular pie.- The square pizza (cooked in a sizzling hot pan) has a thicker crust so it holds toppings better than the regular pie (thinner crust) IMO.

Others relax, open up, and take what they get, hoping for something to make them love again. Opened: 1963Distinction: Indisputable King of NY PizzaWatch: The Best Thing I Ever Done HQ by ME MacKenzie, about Dom and his family, running DiFara Pizza.Tips: -- Come on an off day and an off time or early (noon). This is a must visit pilgrimage for any pizza fanatic. But if your time in NYC is limited, I wouldn't risk your day by coming here. There are too many variables - too many things that can go wrong. Instead, go to Patsy's or John's of Bleecker on Bleecker.-- The wait is going to be one of the things you will talk about later. Find something to do in Midwood in the meantime. -- See their Facebook page for frequent irregular changes in schedule-- There is a debate which is better, the Sicilian or Neapolitan pizza. There is no clear cut winner, and neither resemble a traditional pie. Get them both or come back next week. -- It's like a zoo in there. When you order, be a strong New Yorker. Push to the front and assert yourself. Dom does not have pity, he only has dedication to his pizza. Get your name on the paper right away.-- Don't be too eager to grab your pie. After Dom puts it on the counter, out comes the fresh basil snipped on top. Try to sneak a few words with the legend.-- You have to be able to accept a pie a little burnt, but if it's completely black send it back and make Dom eat it - keep him in check.",4/5/2017Updated review,489,1410,217,wo632pzj23-Di2RakSugjQ

745,Kerri M.,0.0,4,"So, I finally made it to DiFara to try the ""best pizza in New York"" and I was ready for the wait. I rolled up at 11:33am on a Thursday morning, aiming to be early in the line for a noon opening, and parked at a meter spot. To my surprise, only two Brooklyn dads were waiting so I queued up behind them. At 11:45 the doors opened and a very nice man took first their order and then mine. I asked for a sausage slice and a plain square slice. I also grabbed an old fashioned glass bottle of Pepsi from the fridge. I sat down at one of the communal tables. About five other people came in and ordered after me. My pizza came out bubbling hot at 11:56 with the nearly liquified cheese slipping off the slice. I took mine to go, the better to give it time to be eating temperature.  It was a hot and sunny day so I noshed in my air conditioned car about ten minutes later. My review: the sausage slice was tasty and the nice plump plum tomato chunks and fresh basil leaves made a pleasant flavor combo. The sausage seemed high quality. But it wasn't early shattering, it was just good nyc pizza. The square slice had a different sauce profile somehow and it tasted sweeter. Again, good but not great until I got to the crust. The crust was crunchier and more flavorful than any I've ever had. That was special. I'm glad I tried it and I had a pleasant, easy experience, but I have to say that both Roberta's in Williamsburg and Nick's in Forest Hills are to my taste better pizzas.

We ate about an hour later, but in the meantime, got a table to sit at so it really wasn't unpleasant at all. I kind of expected to be let down but DiFara himself prepared the pie and snipped our basil and added parmesan so really, this was the royal treatment. We split a round pie, half plain, half pepperoni and next time I'd do exactly the same thing. I was trying to think about what makes this special, and I think it might the finishing touch of cutting fresh basil right there on your pie. Totally worth the trip to Midwood (which is actually a really interesting part of Brooklyn to see - also explore Ditmas Park while you're at it) and 100% worth the meal.",5/4/2018,318,539,111,vonMXBggu3cHeyYCXKkqGg

People and reviewers have fallen for the romance.  The wonderful story about a humble guy who has been making pies in the same location for over 50 years.  A great New York tale, but it doesn't make for a superior pizza.  Certainly not one sold for an unconscionable 5 bucks a slice.  DeFara makes a thin crust, Neapolitan pie, with mozzarella, sprinkled with fresh basil and heavy on the olive oil.  Save for the excessive oil, it's a pie you can easily match with Lombardi or Grimaldi.  Ah, but they don't sell 5 dollar slices, or have a New York icon making them. Tourists and other borough folks will pilgrimage to Brooklyn for the story and to see the legendary chef, and will probably convince themselves that they tasted food of the pizza gods.  But they will be wrong.",5/16/2018,0,3,0,tgp2YMqYvTh-ALy7bT-XVA

The cheese was perfect in its melty goodness, and the basil freshened up the slice. I said it was the only restaurant in New York City worth waiting hours for.However, I came back recently, and admittedly, it wasn't Dom working, so maybe that's why? But the pizza slices I received were so lackluster, and when I'm paying $5 a slice, I expect it to be amazing. I felt like I could get better pizza in my neighborhood. I want to come back here a third time (and make sure Dom is working) and hope for that heavenly slice again, but it's out of the way and expensive to take a risk on.",9/3/2016Previous review,751,496,10,nynCdsDYV1yQm69fkkCdwg

768,A+M M.,0.0,2,"This review is not for the pizza itself, which is pretty good. This review gives equal weight to the food and our experience -- which was awful. We won't be coming back. You may not agree with me on this point, but I really don't have a masochistic tilt -- like at all. You aren't going to make me enjoy a dish more by torturing me before I eat it and then expecting me to give it extra stars because of the contrast between the food and the bad experience getting to the food. I'm not a lab rat, I'm a human being. Stop trying to brainwash me. Honestly guys, the pizza ain't that good. It's good, but let's be real: flour, tomatoes, cheese, basil. I've spent 3 months in Italy and this pizza has nothing on Italy. If you want good pizza, go to Italy because you will get great pizza and you will be happy. Sometimes I think New Yorkers want to be miserable. Di Fara is just further proof of that. Your wait time will not be accurate. If you're lucky, you will have a crate to sit on while you wait. They lock the door so no one can come in without their permission, but the inside is super ugly -- tables and chairs that look like they were stolen from PS _____ arts and crafts room. The idea that there's only one man in New York who can make good pizza is bullshit. Making pizza is simple. You stretch out some dough, put on the toppings, put it in the oven and voila. Anyone can do it. The idea that the water in New York makes for better pizza is even more bullshit. Seriously, if you believe that, you are a total idiot. So little water goes into pizza, and water is literally the cheapest ingredient in ANY dish. If it were the water, someone would be shipping water from New York to California. It ain't the smelly-ass New York water. Trust me on that. I don't know New York Pizza that well, but for just-as-good pizza and a 100,000,000x more pleasant experience, come to Vito's in Beverly Hills.",3/16/2016,289,123,40,2UO1giklYmC41oVBaiUomA

I'm a pizza girl through and through so finally getting to try Di Fara was a huge check off the 'ole pizza bucket list.First off, you wait forever. I went on a random weekday around 2 or 3 pm and there was no break in line. You can watch the old man make the pizza which is cool. He really takes his time on getting it out of the oven and snipping the basil on top. I was prepared for the line so no big deal.The disappointment comes to the pizza itself. It looks like the top oven doesn't cook like the bottom oven. Certain pizzas came out way overdone. My pizza was unfortunately one of the overdone ones and turned to cardboard real fast. The first few bites of the first slice were heaven; the rest of the pizza was cold and hard in less than 5 minutes. So disappointing.

I'm gonna explain this place to you so you'll get a better understanding of Di Fara Pizza. So sit back, and get ready.First - Its a hole in the wall place, Its not charming. The tables are folding card tables and cheap plastic chairs. Old skool paneling on the walls as well as pictures of Dom making his pizza.Second - Don't think your gonna run in, grab a pie and bolt. You order a pizza and wait. For almost one hour. You may order a $5 slice (if they have it available)Third - location. How the hell do you get here? The friggin Q train?Fourth - Price. Where are you from, Long Island? I'd say a whole pie cost in Lake Ronkonkoma $16 bucks. Not here, its $30 bucks with no toppings. Don't like it? Take the Q outta here babyI ordered a $30 pie with pancetta topping. If your a first timer, don't get too loopy with the toppings! Start out slow. Trust me, the plain pizza by itself is worth it.I see Dom taking a sicilian pizza out of the oven and its sizzling. Friggin sizzling!! I have never seen a pizza sizzle before and trust me its a good thing.I see him making my pizza. It seems so simple, lay on the sauce, thick graded mozzarella cheese and cut up pancetta. He makes these pizzas one at a time. There is no rapid fire 5 pizzas in the oven. Just a few at a time, its a one man operation.When my pizza is finished? HE TAKES THE PIZZA OUT OF THE OVEN WITH HIS HANDS! What. The. Eff!!! He's my hero at the this point.Finally, he takes a handful of fresh basil and cuts a bunch over the pizza. Then drizzles more olive oil on top. So me and my boys fight for a seat on a folding table. We sit down and each take a slice. Holy Moley, THIS was the best pizza I ever had in NY, the best I ever had. Ever.What's probably funny and true? For $30 pizzas, Dom probably owns a small house and lives a simple life. I looked in his old eyes yesterday, he's tired but he loves what he does. And that my friends is the secret of life.

It isn't until it's pitch dark outside that we hear our name called. Finally our half cheese half special pizza arrives. Our square slice was nowhere in sight but no matter I've already waited this long, what's another five minutes.The cheese is very flavorful but drenched in oil and threatening to denude itself from the soggy interior. The outside crust hard as a rock and flavorless. While I was starving waiting for the pizza I looked around shocked that so many people left the crust uneaten, and then I understood. The sauce was unnoticed.The square slice never came, after the second reminder we got a slice out of the oven that was straight up rock hard and burnt. Albeit the sauce on the square was really delicious. Then we were locked inside the restaurant! No idea how this happened but annoying as hell and definitely a huge fire hazard.Maybe we came at a bad time but for a place with such great reviews and a ludicrous wait time the least I expect is consistency in quality.",11/10/2016,0,44,38,uCf9wHTMhw8k_j4Mtkx4GA

The place is a bit small and really vintage looking which is awesome! I came here on a Saturday at 7:30pm and ordered the Regular pie and a square pie. We waited 2 hours to get our pies and it was worth the wait. He makes all the pizza himself and you can clearly see how much he cares about pizza. With each pie he takes his time to make sure it's perfect. What's crazy is when he takes the pie out of the oven he touches it with his hands! I guess he's been doing it for so long his hands don't get burned haha.I liked the square pie a bit more than the regular. I guess it was thicker so you can taste the dough more. It was also nice and crispy while the classic was thin and soft. The regular had more of a cheesier taste and was also really good! One thing to watch out for is to take your time eating the pizza because the sauce is piping hot, since it's fresh out of the oven lol I got the top of my mouth burned a bit.

We got our food around 7, but didn't mind the wait as we were able to snag a table and hang out. Go ready for a wait and just don't worry about it!The square pepperoni was absolute perfection, with a crispy, thick crust on the outside pieces and melty gooey inside pieces. The white pizza had massive chunks of ricotta, the perfect amount of seasoning, and was downright masterful in its preparation. And the classic was just that- the perfect classic New York pizza. From the three pies, we only had 4 slices of the pepperoni remaining.Before the meal I was pretty sure I'd only eat at Di Fara once, as it's a schlep, expensive, and a long wait. However, I really enjoyed my experience,from the lovely woman who took our order (and didn't mind when I changed it two times before they began making it) to the simple toppings that kept appearing as we ate (like chili flakes, fresh parm, chili oil, and garlic powered, to name a few).

One tip I highly recommend you try is to get one of the red peppers in oil from the jars on the counter, and put a piece on your plate so that some of the oil drips into your pizza (or you can put it on your pizza, but i thought the entire pepper might overwhelm it with too much spiciness). The oil and small bits of pepper gives your pizza this amazing smoky and slightly spicy flavor that elevates your slice of pizza to a sublime slice of heaven. I think was a key part what made it soo memorably good.I read that the owner of Di Fara has been making pizza for over 40 years, and he is the only one who makes the pizzas here, and that is how he has perfected his craft of pizza making.  I don't know how many times I've said perfect in this review, but...you get the idea. The only reason I didn't give it a complete 5 stars is because the service from the girl was meh.  She wasn't wasn't very welcoming or nice.  But she wasn't mean either.  But I also think that I'm just used to really perky and nice service from people in CA, because I did notice alot of people in NYC generally had a similar type of attitude. So I guess it wasn't too big a deal.  (And don't get me wrong here, I LOVE NYC!! It was just a different style of service that I'm not used to.)Place - inside is very small, it can seat maybe 4-5 people.  I think most people get it to-go.There are many occasions that I miss this place and want to fly back to NY soon just to eat it!",11/21/2014,376,279,16,_34oc5UpEWT3e7vhrkjn7A
784,Janelle M.,0.0,4,"So, we finally made the journey to Midwood to see if Di Fara lives up to all the hype. First, it's impressive that this guy has been hand making pizzas everyday for so many years and has earned this type of fame. I think the neighborhood itself has lent a hand to Di Fara's acclaim as it certainly stands out among all the kosher spots. Regardless, it's the notoriety that allows a $32 charge for a plain pie and/or a $5-6 slice. I enjoyed both my square and round pie slices thoroughly. It's important to note, that while I can appreciate a good char on a pizza, this pizza was straight-up burnt on the bottom. I'm talking a thick strip of char coming off the crust along the bottom of the pie. I will agree with others that the olive oil added to the pie makes for a somewhat greasy slice; however, I think said grease is part of what gives this pie such good flavor. It's not that nasty orange grease from cheap mozzarella, it's olive oil. There's a whole system in place which involves queuing up outside and placing your order at the window, then going for a walk/standing around outside and waiting anywhere from thirty minutes to three hours, and then you're allowed to stand inside until they call your name. Still at that point, you may have to take those pies somewhere else to eat because there's only a few tables in the back. To sum it all up, I appreciate that this man is so dedicated to his business and that he's using fresh quality ingredients. Bottom line is: it works, even with the excessive char and (arguably) excessive oil. When you take all the hassle into account, I'd say it's probably only worth a trip out here once or twice. I can't drop stars for the location or the wait; it was my choice to schlep out there and you have to realize once a place becomes an institution, a wait is inevitable.",3/27/2016,54,456,109,JXbz8URET4T6SWVrDmKWTA

786,Mitch B.,0.0,3,"Finally found time to try DiFara's on what turned out to be an unexpected, spontaneous pizza crawl in Brooklyn with my son a couple of weeks ago.  Waited close to an hour for a few slices of a round pie (He wasn't doing squares that day) surrounded by a mix of hipsters and locals all agog over the pizza and watching (some filming) the old master ply his trade.   Okay.  I get it.   It's a cool experience and the pizza is really, really good.  Then why did both my son and I look at each other as we left and almost simultaneously say, ""let's go get some L&B squares.""    Twenty minutes later, after one bite of a square L&B slice from a fresh pie, my son and I looked at each other and again almost simultaneously said, ""Now that's great pizza!""   Wow.   I have admittedly been disappointed in L&B the last couple of times I was there. To the extent  I thought its time had passed, I was wrong.  This was how I remembered it.  There is simply no comparison between an L&B square and any other pizza I have ever tasted, including DiFara.",4/2/2016,8,78,12,sS-bFI-qVwCkucjdPxYMbQ

788,Annie T.,1.0,5,"After two visits, more than six years apart, I feel I can better comment on the pizza here. The wait was about 1hr and change each time. My husband and I knew what to expect and were prepared. Decor is minimal to say the least, but that's really not where their focus is on. At least they retouched the walls... Each pie is made with fresh ingredients straight from Italy. You have the pleasure of watching Dom, the patriarch and only chef, create the pie , take it out of the oven with his bare hands and cut fresh basil on top. Can't say that about many places. In our recent visit, we had the Sicilian (square) pizza with cheese,  half side with sun dried tomatoes. My husband didn't think it was as good as the round. To me, the pizza remained the same. Thick and crispy crust mostly burnt on the bottom. The sauce is flavorful, greasy with the olive oil but not overwhelmingly so. Lots of mozzarella and parmesan on top. It's not perfect but it's very tasty, and a bit messy to eat. The next day our leftovers were even better. pricey and it's cash only. square pie was $32.All in all, it's worth trying it while this living legacy is still at it.",10/13/2014,685,603,743,cBIkLz-J_qyKAtFCZy9dUw
789,Michael B.,0.0,5,"Yep, they aren't lying. Di Fara truly is top 5 best pizza in New York (the world). I'd put it at 2nd best in NYC for round (arguably #1 but I just adore Sal & Carmines), as well as 2nd best for square (It doesn't beat L&B Spumoni).I must try the sausage peppers and onions slice (apparently a lesser known specialty there).Mr. DeMarco is lovely, everything they serve is delicious, and the wait is really as long as they say. On occasion Mr. DeMarco doesn't make it in to work, and then there is no pizza. This is often not announced until a few minutes before opening, which can leave a line full of hungry people stuck in the cold (literally). There is a pizzeria directly next door. Do not let the disappointment of being denied Di Fara cause you to go in instead. Just don't do it. If you need something else in Midwood in a pinch, head over to the Hasidic schnitzel place nearby.",2/26/2015,68,20,0,1pAhySaMrEslzGYhgxfPjA

791,Diana M.,0.0,5,"Pizza in NYC is akin to religion and politics. Heated debates, everyone thinks they're right, and loyalties are nearly impossible to sever. Personally, I think it's crazy to compare top NYC pizzas, they are all different from each other and there's a lot of quality here. Seriously, if you're arguing over NYC pizza just be glad you have options worthy of debate.I love Di Fara, it's absolutely one of my favorite NYC pizzas. When I lived in Ditmas Park in the early 2000s this was basically my local pizza joint, I had no idea that it was the subject of such debate. All I knew was that I loved the pizza. The drizzle of olive oil, the handcut basil, the cheese freshly grated for each pie, the care that Domenic put into each pie. The experience is not for everyone and if you go expecting it to be an efficient experience you will be disappointed. Worse, you will likely be very annoyed. It's always busy, he cannot and will not move faster than he does, there are no shortcuts and no way around the process that has been in places for decades. It is what it is. If you can roll with that then you are on your way to one of the most lauded pizzas in NYC. This pizza is good because of the time and intention that Domenic puts into each pie. Oh, and the high quality, fresh ingredients. You don't need to get fancy here. The plain pie is sublime.",3/30/2016,8,91,0,mZv5rlPN1psDRchowteq0A

We saw someone eating the square slice and it looked like a piece of heaven so we vowed to return and try it. Today was that day.... Our recommendation is to stick with the regular slice. The square was good, but not as good, and the crust was super hard. All in all, get there early and expect to wait at least 20 minutes, but its a must go place if you're a pizza lover!",6/4/2016,25,18,14,iBpR1yqcI7jf84-SoZKLbA

796,Joel T.,0.0,4,"Ok, first the good: The pizza was delicious. Got a square pie w/ sausage and it was honestly a damn beauty. Crispy (i mean make your jaw hurt crispy!), yet chewy buttery crust, tangy yet sweet tomato-y sauce, cheese with just the right amount of stretch, and the sausage was in shape of discs that were plentiful without being overwhelming. Oh and that fresh herb on top is a really nice touch. I can't really put it into words but while the toppings were saucy, oily, and plentiful, that crust still held up beautifully and kept its shape. If pizza is all about the dough, this place is the pizza mecca. Anyway, now on to the bad(-ish): the wait... oh the wait! Feel free to catch up on whatever show you're behind on or finish that novel you've been working on because like any good Samuel L. Jackson monologue in a Tarantino flick, this is gonna take a while... (for me personally the wait was worth it). Also when the lady dusted my pie w/ parmesan she got more on the pan than the pizza (she got distracted talking to someone) and when she cut the pie she struggled (because like i said that dough is nice and crunchy) so some sauce/cheese got on my pants. I had an akward staring exchange when the woman next to me saw my reach down and then put that sauce/cheese in my mouth. The place is also kind of out of the way in New York (i like the neighborhood but if you're a tourist its not really near anything, maybe stop here on your way to Coney Island or something if you're taking the subway). Also its hotter than satan's asshole in that place. But all-in-all a great pie, a definite must-visit, one of the best in the city. Truly blessed that i got to have Dom make me a pie in his and my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and eat this pizza.",10/8/2017,0,6,6,axlJWR3KrQah6-mMYR4XoA
797,Ka Ho Y.,0.0,3,"Been hearing a lot of good things about this place from friends. I passed by this place almost everyday for the past 4 years (went to Brooklyn College), yet I never stepped foot into this place. This past Sunday, I finally decided to go, and give it a try. A few friends, and I ordered a pie, and a few slices. We were told the slices would take about 15 minutes, and the pie would be ready in one hour to one hour and ten minutes. Slices took over 30 minutes, and the pie took one hour and forty-five minutes. It was not as packed as what I imagined (3 pm). I felt like they need to give better time estimates, just because they have been doing this for such a long time. A few groups got their pies before us, even though we ordered before them. Not sure how that happened...The slices, and the pie was a little burnt I would say. I saw some nicely baked ones, but unfortunately not ours. Was definitely a little disappointed on that. I have been eating pizza around New York for a while now. There were only 2 things that caught my attention. Which was the tomato sauce, and also the half dried tomato topping. Those were considered unique and flavorful in my opinion. Compared to other pizza restaurants.Now, let me talk a little about the restaurant itself. I know they have been doing business for a long time. If you were to take a closer look at the interiors of the working space, everything is old. The counters, floor, working areas are super worn-out. It can potentially be pest infested through the cracks and crevices. I am not saying it is, but it looks that way. The amount of money they charge (5 for a plain slice, 34 for a square pie with toppings), they could get a renovation in.For me, this is definitely a onetime thing. Longest I have ever waited for pizza. It was also pricier than expected.",6/6/2016,27,4,1,cHpz8zKTeaDifHFrTYmPVw
798,Klarissa L.,0.0,5,"Went on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  They open at 12, we got there at 11.50am and were first in line [I think this is rare, but since it was rainy, there was less of a crowd].  The doors opened at 1pm.  At this time, there were about 30 people in line behind us.  The people behind us in line were really rude, pushy and obnoxious - but this doesn't reflect on Di Fara's at all.  Di Fara's staff was very nice and super friendly.  I think they messed up our order, but we were so excited about the pizza, we didn't care. There are three tables that each seat 5 people.  But there are extra chairs so technically you can squeeze about 7 to a table ... in general people are very friendly and getting Di Fara's pizza is an adventure/experience. They are BYOB, so you can bring your own wine/beer which is nice.  Just don't forget to bring your own bottle opener  The Pizza - is absolutely amazing.  We got 4 pies, and all were perfect.  They have square and round pies.  I personally like the crust and texture of the rounds better.  But the square was perfectly done as well.  The square had a thicker crispier crust, I've heard since it takes longer to cook, sometimes it's burnt, but ours was cooked perfectly.Classic Round - just cheese, basil and olive oil - sooooo simple yet so delicious.  Garlic and Pepperoni - garlic is to die for! Pepperoni is thick small cuts, Love it! Veggies and Sausage - veggies add a nice touch and the sausage is fantastic Square Sicilian - was much thicker than the rounds - at the time it was my least favorite of the four pizzas we got, but we were also the fullest at this time.  Ate some room temperature left overs a few hours later, and this was my favorite ... Love this place - easily the best pizza i've had in New York thus far - and the three others i was with agreed.  I definitely  would come back and recommend to others, you just have to have the mindset that it's an adventure.  Don't go when you're starving and expect pizza immediately.   Pizza is pricey - our 4 pizza's cost us $130, but I think it's totally worth it!  We also had left overs that reheat well and are still very delicious!

Read that again before you whine and trust fund about the wait times or the fact that it's $5 a slice. Entitlement should be left at the door. 2 bros might be more of your jam.Now that I've vented (I just can't stand the notion that people would complain about this place) I'd like to share my experience of this spot.Dom is an older gentleman, and most older gentlemen retire, trading the high energy lifestyle of NYC for a more relaxed approach... Shuffleboard, Mai Tai's, dinner at 4:00pm, and panhandle sunsets. Most older gentlemen are enjoying the fruits of decades of labor. Not Dom. He's standing next to (damn near inside of) an 800 degree oven day in day out. So the fact that the pizza takes a minute shouldn't surprise anyone. If I can move at all when I'm his age I'll be grateful. If you watch long enough you'll see this man with asbestos hands remove a square tray with no gloves and by god I've never seen him flinch.Now... You come here for the pizza, for sure. But when you do, take the time to observe a master of his work. Irrespective of profession anyone could take joy in watching a person who quite clearly loves their work - doing just that.There are like 1,00,000 reviews about the pizza itself...

808,Alejandro B.,0.0,5,"One of my favorite slices in NYC but note the caveats. Di Fara was in my NYC food bucket list and it certainly did not disappoint. I contemplated ordering a slice with toppings but my friend Mike simply said to order a regular slice plain. He was right. The regular slice is perfectly calibrated in terms of toppings (all extremely fresh) and a light and crispy crust. Expensive as it was, I was still happy to pay 5 bucks for it. It's a masterpiece, pure and simple. It's different than other pizza places I love, but I like being able to compare outstanding offerings without having to pick a favorite overall. That's NYC for you! (Hopefully I'll enjoy St. Louis style pizza as much when I move there this summer). And yet, just as the regular slice was one of the best I've ever had, the square slice (6 dollars) was one of my least favorite slices ever. The ratio that the regular slice perfects is completely absent here. Instead, with a square slice you get a uniform crust that's way too tough to cut with a plastic knife and too messy to eat. There's too much sauce and the crust towards the end was burnt. I've liked dollar slices of pizza or even Dominos more than I liked the square. I repeat. Don't even bother ordering a square slice here. Go strictly with the regular slice. Knowing that this place was popular, my friend and I visited on a Wednesday at 2pm; we ordered right away and got our slices in about 15 minutes. Had no problem getting seating. Then again, given the speed of the process and the limited seating here, I wouldn't want to see Di Fara at its busiest. (Yelp, if you can hear me, include wait times in restaurant pages please!). It's an out of the way location if you live in Manhattan, but having food at Di Fara is a good excuse to explore a new neighborhood in the city. However, I know I'd be pretty disappointed if I ventured this far, only to have the place be closed (and it seems like you wouldn't really know from calling in advance or checking online). Between getting there and picking the right time to visit, it really is a process, but I'm proud to check this off my bucket list with flying colors.",4/20/2016,348,387,18,xzXU5tzSMqbLCLvZGuawGA

We were told it would take 20minutes for two slices, then after an hour wait we were told to wait just ten more minutes. After 1.5 hours I was presented with a $5 mediocre pizza slice at best with a crust so terribly burnt it was hard to eat. The customer service is poor and the bathroom is so disgusting I am truly curious as to how this place is still open. Tip to the owners: don't lie about the wait times. And don't give attitude when customers ask when they can expect their food when its already overdue by 40mins. This all just yells greed over customer satisfaction and service. If you're gonna take all you can get, at least use the money to standardize the operations and clean your premises.

Initially we'd planned to get by the slice, but by the time we ordered we were hungry enough for a whole pie. $30 for a plain with 8 slices. We waited another 40 minutes for the pizza to come out and finally our name was called. We elected to eat inside as there was space. The pizza was beautiful. Crispy dough covered generously with tomato sauce and mozzarella then basil and Parmesan on top. A good amount of oil on top too made it extra delicious. One of my favourite pizzas of all time. The only downsides were the wait (1.5 hours!) and I wish the crust had a bit more flavour and/or you were given extra tomato sauce for dipping because that stuff is delicious.

816,Julia F.,1.0,5,"Sometimes the simple things in life are what really make an impact. Good food made with love and a sense of pride shared with appreciative mouths. That's the DiFara experience in a nut shell. The originator himself stoops over his dough and sauce, methodically (albeit slowly) moving back and forth to put pies in the oven or cut sprigs of basil from his plants by the window. He is so focused, he's developed a permanent hump in his back from the thousands of pizza's he has likely created since he started fiddling with dough back in his early twenties. That's a lot of pizza. So, how can you doubt the stuff wouldn't be magical??!!In keeping with that theme of simple, just sauce and cheese with some raw garlic on top and I'm a happy little Mediterranean girl.",9/5/2014,124,204,62,ck-i1deLxFgK-cIPDMdktQ

818,Danielle S.,0.0,2,"Today was my second time going here. First time was good, second time was only ok, Dough was salty and pizza slices were tiny. For $5 a slice the slices should be way bigger and should taste better overall. Plus most days you wait at lest 25-30 min for a slice. I will not be back.If you're looking for good pizza without the hype I would suggest you get back on the Q train, get off at Newkirk Plaza and go to Lo Duca pizza. Pizza is just as good but cheaper and minus the long lines and hype.P.S. this place is super divey. No one even comes out to wipe the only 3 tables in this establishment. For the money they charge you they could at least fix the place up a bit, maybe wipe down the tables every once in a while and add some table cloths for goodness sake.",1/7/2016,12,121,5,xNj1bMB4A7lquzx0-LsEEg

Yes, it's a great story about the hard-working pizza creator who does all the work and puts fresh basil on every pie. His brilliance with pizza doesn't excuse the apathy on the customer service side of things.Some would say the confusion of the line and the nearly two-hour wait for three pies just adds to the charm. Some may believe that forcing the pizza tourists to eat on the sidewalk by inexplicably making it takeout-only today makes it an authentic NYC experience.I have only praise for the pizza itself. The pepperoni/sausage combo was the most quickly devoured in our group but the meatless ones seemed better examples of Di Fara's expertise. The margherita made brilliant use of cheese and the vegetable combo featured powerful minutes. In conclusion, it may be worth venturing out to Avenue J, but keep in mind that you may be standing there for hours.",9/7/2014,200,770,1105,lO_L4Otm-hJQ0CvbDcynxA

823,Matt K.,0.0,2,"Heard about this place for years. I've always avoided it due to the infamous 1 to 2 hour waits, not to mention the bumps in the city's health grading system. Ordered a round pie. It was a 40 minute wait, about 2pm on a Tuesday. Pizza looked delicious, and was topped with fresh basil. After eating this, I found this place to be overrated. The pie was good, but not $30 good. Also for that price, I would expect fresh mozzarella as opposed to the cheap, oily cheese that was used. Besides being greasy, It was on the salty side as well. There are many places locally that I like better. If the pie was $18, I'd rate it 4 stars. At $30, I'll pass next time and check out other options.

824,Tom Y.,0.0,5,"There seem to be two types of people in this world - those who truly enjoy good food for what it is (good food) and those who feel the need to bash on hype just to spite people. I like to think I'm grouped into the former, so I took a trip out to Midwood with my parents to treat everyone to an experience.Dom DeMarco is a living legend in pizza - this man has made the same pies, by hand, himself, for over five decades, and the delicious pies he fusses over day in and day out have been rated the best in New York by Zagat and the ""best of the best"" by Anthony Bourdain.But none of that should matter. Go for the food, brave the lines and the wait, grab a beer at a bodega nearby or get a coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts down the street after you put in your order and wait.Dom will stretch the dough by hand, ladle over some fresh tomatoes, freshly grate some cheese (two types of mozzarella), and pop the pizza in the oven. When it comes out, he'll freshly cut some basil leaves and sprinkle some parmesan cheese over it, pour some great olive oil over, and eventually, your name will be called and your steaming hot pie will be ready to eat.The texture of the pie is amazing. The dough is perfectly cooked, and while many pizzerias will have the cheese, tomatoes, and dough in three separate layers, at Di Fara, it's all in one, flawless piece. The umami flavors from the parmesan add great depth to the slices, as do the freshness from the basil leaves. The mozzarella is amazing and perfectly caramelized right there and you'll wish the pizza will never end....alas, all pizzas must be finished. Highly recommended.",7/6/2014,327,243,257,jKLWPimZ4dge0P6pWWgYkQ
825,Marybelle P.,0.0,5,"The pizza here is delicious and you can taste the freshness in each bite.  We bought 3 squares with different toppings for 2 of us but I think the next time we come around, we should just get a whole pie.  Each square is $6 plain but if you add toppings, you could be adding $1 - $2 more to each slice.  After our 3 squares, we bought another 1 slice because we just couldn't get enough! Mmmm...fresh olive oil, basil, tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese.  Surprisingly there was not much of a line when we got there one Friday afternoon but understand that they make this pizza fresh.  It could take like another 45 minutes to an hour just to get your food.  Slices are speedier to come out than squares.  An full plain pies might sometimes be faster than single slices.  Things to think about...I'm originally from Chicago so I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl but even with that said, I would say this has got to be one of the best pizzas, maybe not the best, but one of the best...",11/9/2014,132,112,74,r-0srffLzdJkHBI1ATy0Jg
826,Qui C.,1.0,4,"The hour trek from Midtown to here was worth it. It's expensive for a slice of plain pizza, $5 a pop, and if you want topping, add an extra $1. And it takes forever! You place your order on this reservation system and when Di Fara have enough people ordering the slices to make a pie, then they throw it in the oven. If you're the first person to reserve that slice then you wait 40 minutes. If you're the last person, then you wait half that time.It makes sense though to keep the quality of the pizza you serve always fresh, always pipping hot out of the oven. It just takes so long! We waited close to an hour just to eat two slices to pizza. But nonetheless, it was delicious!The sauce completely makes this pizza stand out. The fresh basil, good quality olive oil drizzle at the end both makes it for what it is too. Amazing pizza...next time though, I'm calling ahead.",6/19/2014,760,924,200,03RJcIDcNwH4WQmqjIvwIw

I was expecting a religious experience!  Very hard for any establishment to live up to such hype. So it was, my pizza was really very good, but honestly, I've had better. I always judge a pie without any add-ons, i.e., plain only (crust, sauce, cheese, spices and nothing else) so that you get the real essence of the pizza. Conclusion was:  I've had better in New Haven, Naples Italy, Portland OR, New Jersey, and Vero Beach FL.  At Di Fara, I loved the lore, the charm, the legend, the experience and nostalgia. But I expected more. We had a regular plain pie and a Sicilian plain pie. The Sicilian was better, all 4 of us agreed. Also $30 for the plain pie and $34 for the Sicilian -- cash only -- is egregious, exploitative pricing.

I don't know if I'm just lucky but I've never had to wait an inordinate amount of time for my pizza here. Yes, it's busy whenever I come and there's a line-up but 20 mins at most, which isn't that long compared to some places I've waited. I can't quite put my finger on what I love so much about this pizza, I think it's the slight sweetness of the sauce and the oil drizzled on top.

You can taste the love that Dominick puts into making pizza. I do not eat pizza crust unless the pizza is amazing. The crust was crunchy and not overly chewy. The sauce, cheese, olive with basil was just enough to soar the rating of this pizza to the top. I chose not to add toppings for my first tasting so I could experience the pizza taste in its original form. It is hard for me to choose if I preferred the slice or the square, as they were both great. I can't wait to come again. Next time I will definitely order a pie.

838,Rosemary V.,1.0,3,"Important tips:-Get there early-Bring a snack or eat a real meal before you leave your house.  Whatever you do, don't come here hungry!-Go to the counter and order your pizza.  There isn't really a single line, some people are waiting to order food while some people are waiting for seats so just ask people if they're waiting to order.-Expect to wait at least 40 minutes for the pizza to be baked.-There aren't a lot of seats so unless you're taking the pizza to go, don't go there with more than 4 people. -Make sure you come back at least 20 minutes before your pizza is done in order to get seats.  -The pizza is greasy and soggy so get lots of napkins.Ok so on to my review.This gets a 2.5 but I will be nice and give it 3 stars.The first time I went there was Easter Sunday and it was closed! I checked their website and called to double check that they were closed but nothing! When we got there there was no sign saying they were closed, so I was not a happy camper.We went again this past Sunday around 5:30pm. Their website says they close from 4:30-6 but they did not (perhaps they should update this). We put in our order and they told us it was going to be 40 mins.The food!We ordered 4 slices, 2 plain triangles, one triangle with sausage and one square with pepperoni. The plain triangle slice was just okay, yes, you've heard me, ""just okay"" and my date felt the same. It was not worth the wait. The square slice however, was pretty damn delicious and perhaps one of the best Sicilian slice I've tasted. It was crunchy, saucy, super cheesy and the pepperoni was so good.AmbianceThis place is small, super plain and honestly, it could use a face lift... at $5 a slice, I am sure they can afford to make the place look as good as its reputation.Service: There is one guy at the counter who takes your order and he is pretty friendly.  But other than that, there isn't much to say about the service. I understand that some people find the fact that DeMarco makes each pie exciting but I don't. You know what I find exciting? Not having to wait 40 minutes for pizza.  If he were to teach someone he trusts how to make pies the waiting time could be cut by half (who knows, even more!).  The oven can clearly fit more than one pie.I am glad I tried it but like skydiving, this is one of those things most people will do only once.",4/28/2014,251,530,278,fjckdImR7BuOy7F0GjORzg
839,Alice L.,0.0,4,"I came here on a spontaneous pizza adventure one night only to find the place to be closed. Luckily we explained to the nice man working that we trekked it all the way here just to try this pizza and he let us order a pie! Also, he was very patient with us as we asked questions about what to order. Excellllllent customer service. We finally decided on a reg pie with prosciutto. I've probably read over 10 articles on this supposedly magical pizza before actually trying it. This is by far the most hyped pizza in nyc and my expectations were extremeeeeeely high. The ingredients in this pizza are top quality. You can taste the difference. Mr. Di Fara took absolutely no shortcuts. I understand the hype. I was very impressed by the dough of the pizza. It is super thin, but not soggy. It is thinner than any other pizza I've had before. The crust is perfectly crispy and thin. I realize that I just repeated myself, but it was absolutely necessary to get the point across (: The pie itself was good enough that it didn't even need the prosciutto. I would recommend to keep the toppings to a minimum so the pizza can really shine. As we were halfway through the pie the worker came over and gave us some hot peppers. This took the pizza to a whole other level. The peppers are really really good. They were flavorful with a spicy kick. Yum!As previously stated, I totally get the hype. Is this place WORTHY of the hype? I'm honestly not sure. I thoroughly enjoyed my pizza. It's good for what it is, but would I line up for hours and dream about it? No, I would not.

841,Marcus Z.,0.0,3,"Di Fara. Di Fara. Di Fara. I'm still not sure what rating to give you. After all, your reputation as America's best pizza precedes you. Let's see...If we base rating on hype and publicity, you deserve 5 stars. Everyone talks about the amazing Dom De Marco and his amazing skills. People rave about the pizza across all 5 boroughs and beyond.Let's talk taste. For sure 5 stars. Crispy, hot, fresh, addictive. The ingredients used in this classic NY style pizza slice are as fresh as they get. It's a great slice. And that's where the high ratings ends for me. When you factor in other things like wait time, price, location, and service, the pizza suddenly tastes not as good. For starters, $5 for a slice of pizza is outrageous. I don't care how fresh the ingredients are. They're in Midwood for crying out loud. Their rent isn't that high. And they're making pizza. The profit margin on that is HUGE. They're just ripping people off because of the hype. On my last visit, I waited and hour for a slice and for some reason the cashier was rude. When I finally got my slice, it was tiny. Maybe 5 inches in length and a crust about 4 inches across. Mamma mia! $5 for a mini slice? Ma vaffanc*lo!

843,Joe C.,0.0,3,"Yea, I get it. I get that this place is considered by many to be the holy grail of NYC pizzerias. I get the fact that Dom DeMarco makes every pizza by hand himself and because of that fact the wait time becomes ridiculously long. I get it. I get that despite all the fame and notoriety, the DeMarco family doesn't spend a dime on the interior, so it probably looks the same way it did 30 years ago. I get it. It's nostalgic. I grew up in an Italian American family myself (yes they do exist outside the tri-state area for those clueless New Yorkers who think otherwise) and this pizzeria reminds me of several pizzerias back home. One difference is back home no self respecting Italian pizza maker would sell his pizza in slices. It's a matter of freshness. Slices are a NY thing. But I digress. So I get it. I get it all.Well I get most of it. What I don't get is how some people think this is the best pizza in the country. I think all the nostalgic and the huge anticipation of waiting in a long line may have warped some peoples' judgement. Either that, or many New Yorkers don't get out very much. Now I understand many don't own vehicles but that's no excuse to not explore the world outside the city. If they had they're realize that many pizza places make a better pizza than DiFara's.So what did I not like? My biggest complaint was that the pizza was dry. No, Domenic didn't forget to add tomato sauce or olive oil. I just prefer a more wet and floppy pizza. Otherwise it's basically focaccia bread. Unfortunately the pizza's dryness also attributed to its rigidity. Rigid pizza sounds yummy, right? No.I also didn't like the fact that the cheese congealed 30 seconds after taking possession of my pizza. I prefer an ooey, chewy, gooey cheese, the kind that stretches a mile when pulled. There was none of that happening on my pizza. Also, the sauce was a bit too sweet for me. I prefer a more basic tomato sauce that's just one step below diced tomatoes. Last of my negatives was the price. $28 for a pizza?? I thought that was a joke until I actually handed over 28 smackers for my pizza.So what did I like? I liked the whole DeMarco family working together and in spite of very demanding customers they managed to treat everyone with the utmost respect. Very very cool. I liked the whole nostalgic and tradition thing. It's impressive that Dominic has been making pizzas here since the 60's, but it's not overly impressive because I can name a handful of pizzerias back home that were pumping out pizzas before Dominic was in diapers.Like I said I'm Italian American. This place would be ""mom approved"" because of the Padre Pio prayer card sitting on the back wall. My mom is a big fan of him too and has an arsenal of other prayer cards in her possession too.Lastly, I like the fact that DiFara's makes traditional NY style of pizza. Many of the newer fru fru pizza restaurants in Brooklyn make a style of pizza that is more artisan-like, than New York-like. Lucali and Paulee Gee's I'm looking at you. Again, tradition.

Di Fara's is casual, and with it's casual feel comes a high quality parade of deliciousness in each bite of food you have there. It's simply the best in New York.

846,Camille H.,1.0,3,"I recently realized that I live pretty close to this place so the beau and I went over to see if all the hype and press (who does this man's PR?) would hold up.We got there right before the shop opened and there was a line of tourists and locals about 30 people deep. We decided to wait, thinking it wouldn't be too long since the line was slowly but surely inching along, but we were mistaken.You see, people leave their orders - most people order a whole pie - and Mr. Difara single handedly has to make and bake each pie in one oven. So, we misunderstood people getting off the line for having their orders met when instead they were just paying and pilling up. I believe our wait was about an hour.Now, for the things that might put you off:Each slice is $5 and the whole pies are pretty expensive. If you are getting just a slice or two you have a better chance of getting out of there faster but not a whole lot faster.This place is CASH ONLY! (ugh) The shop is super small so we were sharing a table in the back with a family of four. The pizza itself was good, but pretty greasy and not the BEST pizza I've ever tasted in my life.I went back a few weeks later for a slice and there was barely any basil on my slice and it was kind of burned. XXXYou should know that during certain times of the day you can walk in and get a slice without waiting forever. Come on a weekday in the middle of the day (2pm) and hope he hasn't closed - since the entire operation hinges on whether he feels ok and can work that day.TIPS: You don't need to pay for all the extra toppings. The first time I had peppers added and there were barely any on our pizza. The second time, when I just bought a slice, I had it plain and it was fine.

For me this is the absolute best square slice I've ever eaten! Molten hot oil, perfect char and the best three cheeses you can put over what ever delicious tomato sauce he uses. I hate giving up secrets but every time We go we get at least two square pies. One to eat there that day and the other to take home and freeze for a day when I just can't wait an hour for a pie. The bonus days are while I'm waiting for my pies and he's serving the single slice line of people i get to sneak an appetizer square slice that hasn't been claimed. I've occasionally tried a round slice but not the best for me. If you can handle it and have a big party you have to eventually try the calzone. It's delicious too.

848,Peter N.,0.0,4,"I figured that since we were going to walk the Brooklyn Bridge that this would be a good opportunity to finally go for it and make the trip (approx. 1 hour) to try this place. When we arrived there was a small crowd gathered outside waiting to place their orders which came with a 45 minute wait per pie. The reason for the wait was because Mr. Domenico takes his time and meticulously goes through each step necessary to prepare every pie made-to-order himself. The place itself is a typical cramped neighborhood hole in the wall pizza joint with limited seating filled with the aromas of fresh basil, herbs and baked tomato sauce. I decided to order the Di Fara Classic pie ($34:plum tomato sauce, blend of cheeses, sausage, green peppers, onion and mushrooms). The crust was soft and crispy all at once and the ingredients on the pie created a burst of fresh flavors in my mouth. The dough alone set this pie apart from all the others and is the best that I've had so far. There were a few things that could use some adjustments. I found the crust to be salty, the flavor of the green peppers over powered the combination of toppings and the pie could have used a little more meat on it. Otherwise it was a solid pie.I would rank this as having the freshest highest quality ingredients that I've had on a pie in NYC so far. I enjoyed the experience and for those wondering if this is worth the trip, just go for it and prepare for something that's down to Earth and unique. Do it now without regrets while Mr. Domenico is still around. That being said, It's just pizza so remember to have fun with it.",7/19/2016,0,9,14,rRN1XgS4v1WoWLIEa9al6w
849,Adam G.,0.0,4,"What can you say about Di Fara that hasn't already been said. Incredibly fresh ingredients. This slice screams quality. Olive oil, basil, and cheese direct from Italy. Smokey, with a little hint of spice in the sauce. My one gripe... It was too salty. In fact, the saltiness overpowered the subtlety of the slice's first rate ingredients. I was a little disappointed by that. I don't remember it being so salty last time. Of course, I will have to give them another chance. I want to love Di Fara unconditionally.Finally, at 28 bucks a pie it is over priced. Best in WillyB does a better pie at 19.50.",1/11/2015,273,20,9,58xPWBjxt5hosLEhHWhG6A

851,J.P. D.,0.0,5,"My absolute favorite pizzeria, ever! After my first time, 12 years ago, I was hooked, I was in love.Most people complain about the prices. $30+ for a pizza pie but shared between 3-4 friends, $10 for a delicious meal is still cheap! One of the highest rated pizzerias and restaurants on Zagat, averaging 26-28 out of 30 for food. The only other restaurants with that high of a rating are high end sushi, steakhouses, French and fine dining restaurants. A cool observation I've noticed throughout the years.1-2 hour waits are common so come early, weekday lunch or 15 mins before they open. Square are my favorite - the dough baking in olive oil on their cast iron pans creating an oven fried crust. Crunchy and fluffy interior. Sauce is bright tangly and acidic to balance the rich 3 cheese - mozz, buffalo mozz and parmigiano reggiano. Even tho the squares are my favorite, I also love the plain round. For first timers, I recommend getting both round and square and finding your personal favorite. I'm a purist but if you decided to choose toppings, their toppings are delicious and great quality. Hand cut imported pepperoni, porchini mushrooms, wild baby onions, cherry tomatoes etc.",12/1/2015,493,38,33,z5s8n_CYZlWK8-GQDuazxQ

853,Michael L.,0.0,5,"If I had to eat one pizza for the rest of my life, it would be a Di Fara square pepperoni slice.The ingredients work in concert to form the best pizza I have ever had. It has a crispy crust with a soft airy center. The sauce is well balance and loaded with cheese. Topping it with basil and flavorful pepperoni takes it to another level. The complimentary red peppers added a nice kick. Definitely one of the best things I ate in NYC. The wait the pizza is long. I came in on a Thursday afternoon and still waited about 1.5 hours. There is only one man making the pizza and there's only one oven. The wait is worth it though. I prefer the square pizza a lot over the slice. I recommend calling in your order or having a free afternoon because of the wait. The place is also small with only a couple of tables and there is no AC.",7/22/2014,3,8,12,1jvira53kGimPPsKm7Hc9A
854,Peter G.,0.0,5,"Of course I have read many articles and have known about this Di Farra for years. I just never got the chance to get down to Midwood and the famous shop. I had gotten a special $15 offer to see the Beach Boys  at the beautifully restored Kings Theatre, on Flatbush Ave., Tuesday February 9. So I saw that as a perfect opportunity to stop by and try a delicious pizza made by Dom expert pizza maker. I called and they informed me that Tuesday was not a very busy day. February 9 happened to be national pizza day so what better time to visit. I arrived and as soon as I came up out of the subway station DI Farra was the first thing I saw when I looked across the street.It was about 3 PM when I arrived and no  line outside. But there were several people in this small seating area/dining room. I decided to keep it simple and ordered a regular cheese pie. Dom was hard at work. There was a camera crew there from the food network. In about 15 minutes my pizza came out. What a beautiful looking pie. I figured I'd only have four slices and save the rest for later. I eagerly brought the pizza pie back to the long table at the back of the dining room.The wonderful buffalo mozzarella mixed with Parmesan cheese and the fresh basil leaves had such a wonderful aroma. I took out the first slice and Took a bite. The first thing that struck me was how incredibly delicious the actual crust was. It had a full rich deep flavor. Perfect chewiness crispy without being too thin or too thick. The sauce was very flavorful and unique and the three parts buffalo mozzarella cheese really made the difference. The Parmesan cheese along with the basil leaves and olive oil that's poured onto the pizza before it's cooked all work very well together perfectly proportioned which make the pizza absolutely delicious. I've tried pizza at Lombardi's, john's, Totino's and I have to say thatDI Farra definitely had the edge on all those three iconic places. The care that goes into each one of the pizzas , as well as the loving hands of one man. along with the high-quality ingredients is what makes this pizza place worthy of the long trek and higher price definitely worth it.I talked to Dom and told him I was very happy with the pizza. He thanked me and smiled. As I said the food network was there and they were interviewing some people near the front of the dining room while I was eating my pizza. Which I managed to finish off seven of the eight slices. I was actually interviewed by the food network as well. So I hope to see this segment on DI Farra will run  sometime in early September. The weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday is an absolute madhouse . So if you want to experience one of the best pizzas you'll ever have try to come on a Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday. Doors open up at  12:00 pmI definitely plan to return and want to try the square pizza as someone told me as I was eating my pie that that is the one to get. So I'll definitely have to order a square slice along with a couple of regular slices next time.",2/11/2016,8,87,272,28xW1G6tkQ6WfddEhPGzfw

Out of all the this time, I was so lucky to be born during the same time that Di Fara Pizza exists. In the grand scheme of things Di Fara Pizza and I share the same fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a blip of time together, and for that I am forever grateful. Di Fara Pizza is the definitive pizza. Made by a single man who is probably immortal, this pizza will transcend your taste buds. Eating this pizza is like going on a spirit journey. It will make you question the existence of God, and whether or not he is standing behind the counter making that pizza you're eating.Di Fara could murder a man, in fact Di Fara could murder a close family member or friend and I would forgive him because of how good this pizza is. Those of you who live around the NYC area probably know about this already, for those who are just visiting: go here. You will walk in and find a very tiny and kind of dirty restaurant. You will be waiting upwards of an hour on a not so busy day to get your very expensive pizza pie. You will want to do it all over again the next day. Or just later the same day. Pizza has never tasted this good. Sometimes when I am laying in my bed at night, about to go to sleep, I will start to think of all the Romans, and all the ancient Egyptians, and all the prehistoric neanderthals, and all those in the Shang dynasty, who were unfortunate enough to be be born too early to experience Di Fara.

865,Armand D.,0.0,1,"On my first trip to Di Fara's, I arrived during a weekday evening to find a group of customers standing around the counter, waiting silently. The staff behind the counter went about their business, also silently. After about 5 minutes of standing unacknowledged at the counter, I felt like I had stumbled into a solemn wake where I didn't know the deceased, and left.More than a year later, on a quest to find the best pizza in Brooklyn, I stopped by during a summer's afternoon to find the place closed. Okay, fair enough, why not take a few weeks off in the summer? A month later, I arrived at 5 pm to find the place open. Well, not really. The sign said they were taking orders for 6 pm. I couldn't wait, and left, but the woman inside said that they had summer hours, and it would change in the fall.A few weeks later (post Labor Day), they were still on the same schedule.Well, the 5th time's the charm, and at 5:30 on a Wednesday, I finally found them open and serving pizza. Sorta. I could describe the bizarre series of actions and interactions that took place over the 5 minutes I waited in line, but I'll just put it this way: I waited 5 minutes and I was the third person in line - and the orders ahead of me were far from complicated, and one had been pre-ordered. Not organized.But the important thing is the pizza, right? Sure, I had to wait, but was it worth it? Are they dispensing the best pie west of Naples?Nuh-uh. Not by a long shot. I got a tiny slice for $5. It was cold, as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour (every pizza place I've ever been to in New York has the good sense to put it in the oven for at least a minute before serving). And the taste? ""Salty"" pretty much says it all. Given their few opening hours, surly attitude, and mediocre product, I don't see why they don't just hang it up and take the other 11 months of the year off, too. If they don't want to make pizza anymore, that's fine with me. Why people talk about this place as if it were something special is beyond me. Not only could you do better in terms of flavor, price, and service, you literally couldn't do worse at any random pizza parlor in the New York area.",10/7/2015,10,35,2,jLEhlvt7ffxmUGiMtCVbMQ

I was the 1st one there 30 mins before they opened and by the time it was opening the line was down a block and a half. Try the regular pie, square pie or the DiFara Classic pie.

Regardless, it's definitely a place you should try once. So, tough it out once and taste the pizza because it IS delicious. Super flavorful and all the ingredients tastes very fresh. it's not someplace I'd frequent again, wait 2 hours, and pay $30+ for a pie (it's delicious but not MIND-BLOWING-I-MUST-HAVE delicious).(Did I confuse you with my back-and-forth ""TRY IT"" ""BUT NO DON'T"" ""BUT TRY IT"")The reason for the long wait isn't that there are tons of people flocking to this restaurant (it's a small contributor) - it's that they're SLOW at making the pizzas. 1 pizza goes in the oven about every 8-10 minutes. I assumed there would be a 2 hour wait so I was all ready to go to a bar while waiting. However, after walking around the block for 20 minutes, I realized that there aren't any close by!

Di Fara has been around forever and its mystique is pretty well known in the pizza world... I found it to be a little less magical than I hoped for. I got a regular pie and when I opened the box what I found was a slightly disappointing and definitely greasy pizza that without its storied history wouldn't hit the three stars I'm giving it.

They should be ready to take your order when the doors open.  But hey if I've been around that long & have people lining up for me everyday I wouldn't care either.  Please stay around as long as you can!",9/6/2014,17,11,4,le9TZ0oRWKaQT0SSFB4xHA
890,Austin T.,0.0,3,"This place is on every NYC pizza connoisseur's bucket list. In all fairness, once you finally and I mean FINALLY (you'll wait over an hour sometimes for a slice or two) get your char-encrusted slice, you'll taste the olive oil, basil notes, and fresh cheeses RIGHT before it burns your tongue and roof of your mouth. It's deliciously painful. That's IF you can still open your eyes through the smoke to see it enter your mouth. Bring some good reading material or you'll be banging your head on the unclean walls of this hot, crowded, beat down tourist trap in the middle of nowhere. The cost of $50 bucks for a 2 topping pizza though...Are you insane?! Typical outrageousness for NYC. You're clearly paying for the (hopefully 1 time) experience.Because yes, this place follows 'timeless tradition' as the same owner has continually made the pies his way for over 50 years. 'Gee, that's SO NEAT!'...If I was a tourist in town for a few days only. In a city of excellent food already, this is a 1 trick place; a niche, and right of passage for the pizza aficionados. So experience it once and move on! It IS unique. But for practicality, you can get a great slice at hundreds of other places closer (there's even a pizza shop directly across the street!).",4/22/2017,126,19,14,4ReNrVSwH0OsdzYjLpS3xA

895,Mr F G And Mrs M S.,0.0,4,"Some say the Di Fara slice is like a slice of heaven. We've heard so many good things about the pizza here for a while but we were too lazy to take a trip down to Brooklyn to give it a shot. Finally one night, we deiced to drive all the way down to Brooklyn from Queens to fulfilled our curiosity about this place. We were here around 6:30pm on a cold Wednesday evening. There was no line. We waited about 10 minutes just because we wanted the fresh from the oven slice. For $5 a slice, we were expecting something bigger. The size of the slice is just like any other pizza slice in NYC. After reading & hearing about how great the slice is, we came here with a high expectation. The pizza were absolutely delicious! You can actually taste the fresh ingredients. We also like the ""burnt"" thin crust. The sauce is light but very well balanced with the cheese. You'll love the fresh basil and olive oil that they top it with!The place is small, practically a hole in the wall, nothing fancy. We ate our pizza, sit for about few minutes & left. The staff is very friendly. Well, in our opinion, we don't think it's worth going out of your way & paying $5 for a slice.  If you're going to come here, just get yourself a whole pie ($28 for plain pie).",5/6/2017,667,1049,4035,zZkUkK9M0v02qHBCCm5zaA
896,Anthony D.,0.0,5,"I went here recently for the first time in years.  It was exactly how I remembered it...The hours are - they open at 12pm.  There wasn't a line yet - but we got there around 11:30.  Well, they were all inside - getting ready.  And they didn't ""bother"" to open up until 1pm.  Why?  Because they can.They open the window only.  You place your order at the window and they ask you to step towards the front door.Then, when they are ready, they open the door and let you in ONE at a TIME.The old man makes his pizza.  One at a time.  He takes a break to chat with an old friend.  Goes back to making his pizza.  He takes his sweet time making one pizza at a time.A few of us are seated waiting for our pizzas.Some people are outside - they ordered their pizza but aren't allowed in.Some people are outside and haven't even ordered it.The old man goes back every time he needs to make a pie to the backroom.  He gets his dough from the back room.  Every.  Single.  Time.  In.  Between.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  PIZZA.Finally, our pizza is ready.  It's so hot it burns our tongues and mouths like placing a tasty, sauce-filled match in our mouths.After the primary survival instinct of avoiding the first bite due to the heat content of the pizza, the taste sets in - the saucy-ness, the perfect mixture of UNBELIEVABLY fresh mozzarella imported from Italy, grated parmesan cheese, fresh olive oil, and the most crisp, yet also soft dough ever to be tasted.Ah!  Perfect Pizza!  In my honest opinion, better than I remembered it many years ago.  And in my honest opinion, better than any pizza I've eaten in Italy itself.  A must visit before one's death.  But it's quite an ordeal.  Patience is a must.  They do take orders over the phone.  While we were there another old man came over and brought a baguette to give to the Old Man (about 80 something years old).  The Old Man stopped his pizza cooking to chat with this guy.  Please note, customers were patiently waiting at this point.  No one complains.  And there is never a regard for the long line.But once you taste this pizza... you understand why.",2/26/2014,11,24,0,2_LNEDXKm7s__YL_bCVP1Q
897,Dan H.,1.0,5,"When planning my recent trip to visit relatives in Brooklyn, this was thee number one pizzeria that was on my list. Yelp bud Dave G's review from February of this year demanded that I make a visit since I was going to be staying several nights with the cuz'z. Dave prepared me for the spartan digs that Di Fara calls home. My cousin even muttered at one point...""you would think they would slap on some paint once every decade or so."" Yep, a little shabby with maybe a dozen chairs around several basic tables all pushed together. The patrons more or less policed themselves by waving down their fellow diners to alert them that they were almost done and ready to give up their seats. It surprisingly went very smooth. A definite organic camaraderie in a place of such high esteem within the world of pizza aficionados. OK, now that you have been prepared for the homely (not homey) ambiance, and have surely noticed the five stars lets get down to why this place is hallowed ground to pizza lovers. Dom puts so much thought and care into his creations that he has perfected over 50 years performing his labor of love. Only the highest quality ingredients are allowed on these masterpieces, and the taste shows. The super fresh bittersweet San Marzano tomatoes are blended into the sauce and one piece (the one I made sure to grab), had a whole tomato plopped on top. Man-oh-man what a treat those bites were. In all my years of eating pizza this was a first. All pizzas are topped off with fresh basil leaves immediately after the pizza is brought out of the oven. And the crust, oh lordy lord, such perfection. So flavorful, and some pieces were more charred than others. I took the one with the most char as my three dining mates didn't seem excited to go for the full char effect. I loved it. A couple of tidbits: place your order through the window and wait within earshot for your name to be called. There isn't a waiting area, unless you call the bus bench and the milk crates that we sat on out front of their next door neighbor's shop a waiting area. No restrooms, we walked to the Walgreens across the street. No alcohol sold, but you are allowed to BYOB, sorry but I didn't inquire if there was a corkage fee. I would guess there isn't one. They do have a cooler with sodas and water however. OK, number one spot on my list crossed off. How will Lombardi's compare?

899,Scrumphsus B.,0.0,3,"Di Fara's. Diehard pizza aficionados swear it's the best pizza in NYC, if not the world.Ranked near the top of numerous polls as the pizza to beat, Di Fara's claim to fame is the uncomplicated use of quality ingredients as well as the tender loving care given to each pie by Dom DeMarco, an old-school pizzamaker.The first time I heard about this pizza institution was back in 2009. Many plans to taste this mythical pizza were made throughout the years, then quickly scrapped because of its inconvenient location deep in the heart of Brooklyn.My chance finally came in the fall of 2012. My friend Doug was moving to LA and requested a pilgrimage to this pizza mecca. Accompanied by Sam, a fellow pizza lover, we set off on our trek via the Q train.We must have arrived at an off-peak time because the excruciatingly long line mentioned on Yelp was non-existent. As we stepped into the restaurant, we were transported back in time. Framed reviews and magazine articles of decades past adorned the faded green walls, creating a sense of history and legitimacy. Fragrant basil greeted us at the counter as we placed our order of one Di Fara Classic Pie (sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions). In hindsight, we should have ordered a plain cheese pie, a mistake that we didn't realize until later. Watching a master like Dom at work with pizzas was an honor. His movements were deliberate with no action going to waste. Forming the dough from scratch, ladling the fresh tomato sauce, scattering the cheese and toppings and placing it delicately into the oven...these were all actions he must have performed thousands of times and perfected down to a science. The whole process was conducted in silence, interrupted by the occasional grunt of approval as Dom passes the pizza to the welcoming hands of hungry customers - many who have braved the 1 hr travel time and 1 hr waiting time.After 30 minutes, our pizza was ready. Our anticipation crescendoed as we saw him scatter the fresh basil leaves and top the pizza with a few streaks of extra virgin olive oil - the final strokes of his masterpiece.Carrying it carefully to the table, we let the pizza rest a bit, the basil still quivering slightly from the bubbling cheese underneath. Unable to deny our desire any longer, we tore into it.The fresh sauce, pillowy dough, and crispy, charred crust were mouth-wateringly delicious. The mild acidity from the sauce complemented the savory cheese. Unfortunately, the water content from the onions and bell peppers, coupled with the streaks of olive oil resulted in a limp, soggy slice which served as a slip-n-slide for the cheese to slide on our plates with a soft thud.A puddle of oil pooled on our plates as we switched to knife and fork since folding the pizza was no longer a viable option.My lofty expectations were dashed to pieces as I stewed in silence and finished the slice with a swig of Pepsi. But that wasn't enough to wash out the taste of disappointment.The only way to right this wrong was to double down and visit another pizza joint nearby in Bensonhurst: L&B Spumoni Gardens.For additional pictures, please visit (scrumphsus.com/blog/di-f…)",12/1/2016,1,21,71,l_m3aNop7F_s8bq9Ww5UAA
900,Matthew B.,0.0,5,"Just great. The fresh basil and olive oil send this over the edge for me.

901,Maher K.,0.0,5,"Pizza lovers must make the journey to Di Fara's at least once. The pies, both square and regular, are perfect in their own ways. Personally, I prefer the square because the sauce and toppings can fully be enjoyed, while the regular is great to enjoy just the basil and cheese as the main element. Best thing about these pies are the hand prints baked into the crust from Dom personally rounding out the dough.    To all those saying that the pizza in Italy is better, remember this is CLASSIC NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA. Not Neapolitan, not al taglio, & not Sicilian. Di Fara's is the definitive New York Style Pizza Parlor. Places like Di Fara's help remind why and how pizza has become a stable of American cuisine.       The wait is just as long as the trip for me, but it is always worth it.

NO LINE - PRICELESSWhat is true? They have 1 guy making the pizza.A pie is really small, 2 people can easily finish it.The slices are small, thin crust.How he makes the pizza?All ingredients are imported except for the green leaves.  He makes it with the cheese, tomato sauce and dough, after the pizza is done and taken out of the oven, he puts olive oil and basil leaves on top.  How it tastes?Not salty, the cheese didn't emit as much oil like most other places. Different than most pizza joints, but it was good.  The dough was crispy and done perfectly.  Would I come back?I wouldn't try my luck again, what are the chances that I come back and there is no line.  It's not a wow place for revisiting but if a group of friends want to come, i'll consider it.  So far it's closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  They can change the schedule but call to check.There is limited seating tables.",10/10/2013,75,522,1156,ml8VRTkq0CtEWKkDvOsEXQ

I said it twice over five minutes. I wished the two slices could have been  more. The cost is high including in time waiting but it is well worth it. I would have given four and half but yelp won't allow. The half off is because of the cost.

907,Lenny Y.,0.0,5,"Di Fara Pizza is more of an experience, than a pizza restaurant.The place is not fancy (and I'm generous here), the lines are huge (1 hr wait is common) and location is generic.The pizza itself is a slice of heaven though. But what really makes it a 5-star review is the experience - come here when you are not in a rush and stand in line... place an order and watch Dom do his magic - every pie made from scratch, watch him roll and toss the dough, slice fresh veggies, cut up and shred mozzarella, spread home-made sauce, cut fresh basil and pop it in the oven. When it comes out - you are exhausted, hungry and that first bite is pure sex on the plate. You can really taste the love in the pizza.PS. Don't come if you are looking for atmosphere\service, fast food prep\delivery, etc. This is a 1hr+ experience, with pizza being the star and Dom being the magician.",3/7/2016,5,81,158,A9IrqcxcaOU-pYU5gROGWA
908,Robin G.,0.0,1,"I grew up 2 blocks from this pizzeria. It used to be a very relaxed neighborhood hang-out where you could get a good slice any day--even every day! Over the years, every time I saw it on the cover of ""Time Out NY"" I cringed. Not because the pizza is bad (it's good, although it's way fancier now than it was back then--Dom puts on a show) but because, well--""there goes the neighborhood.""  Now it is a tourist destination known to have the best pizza, period. And now the pizza is fancy with 3 types of fresh mozzerela and fresh basil. The basil is a nice improvement, but now it doesn't make sense for anyone in the neighborhood to get pizza here. There are lines, sometimes tour buses. It's crazy.  And a basic slice is $4. If I went by and there was coincidentally no line (say, 11 am) I would say ""what an opportunity!"" and get a slice. But I don't bother anymore.The place makes me feel stupid. There are so many people waiting, and there's no formal line sometimes, they are just standing around waiting for a new pie to come out, and I feel like it's bad form to make eye contact with the staff in case they get the idea that you're impatient instead of lucky to be there. I just don't understand the etiquette and feel out of place.This could be fun for a tourist and/or a group of friends. I have seen back-packers lined up outside waiting for it to open, like they are on a pilgrimage. The pizza is actually quite good, and everyone is sort of buzzed because they feel like they're having this fun experience at a pizza shrine. But this spot is ruined for people like myself living in Midwood.I miss their old incarnation, but I wish them well. Clearly Dom doesn't need to work anymore but he enjoys it. Can you imagine becoming a pizza-making celebrity rock-star after eons of toiling in a regular family-run business!?! I have seen Dom interviewed and on documentaries and on the news for what he does.If you are looking for a very good basic slice of pizza, there is Smiley's or Smilers Pizza on the corner of 7th Ave and 9th Street in Park slope. It's right on top of the F train. I think it's open 24-hours, or late, at least. When I lived in Park Slope I noticed that kids from Bay Ridge  would travel there as a destination spot. I also like their slice with salad on it. Sounds gross but it's delish.",9/3/2015,2,11,0,N6BOEC60k7GTEfNajYZ5cw
909,Sonia I.,0.0,3,"First off the pizza is very good but NOT WORTH WAITING 2 HOURS FOR. Keep in mind I came here around 1pm on  Friday and I only waited about 10 minutes to actually place my order. The older gentleman really takes his time with each and every pie to make sure each is given special attention from shredding the mozzarella to cutting fresh basil to drizzling each with olive oil. Also they have a limited amount of ingedients you can get on each pizza, so you know everything they serve is very fresh and done well.With all that said the pizza is too expensive! I could see the price justification if it was in an expensive area or the restaurant itself was high end...but no. It's in midwood brooklyn and looks like it's never been renovated. The pizza is very good but this place gets 3 stars because it's too expensive and when you have to wait over 2 hours for a pie that literally takes 10 minutes to make I think that says a lot about your management.

You watch him stretch the dough, knead it with his experience; Spread sauce; Freshly grate cheese onto your pizza. This is not a place for you to order a number of pies to go. It's a place meant for you to eat your pizza fresh right after its done, kind of like how you're supposed to eat sashimi the moment its served. The thin foldable crust and cheese at first made the perfect bite. Then, the crust gets pretty hard to chew if you wait too long to eat it. The crust can also be a bit on the salty side and he could have possibly drizzled a bit too much olive oil for your liking. I enjoyed the regular and Sicilian slice, however, eat it fresh.

Eat the pizza there or within 15 minutes!!! By the time we got it home, it had cooled and it was still delicious!!! (but imagine how yummy it would have been fresh)If you want a single regular slice you might be able to escape the wait. Sometimes they have them behind the counter. Service: 3/5It is really slow... I recommend sitting there and waiting for your pizza as I saw one person's pizza was given away because he wasn't there and he showed up right afterwards (too late for him) and had to wait extra 20 minutes. Atmosphere:5/5This place is really old and has a rustic/nostalgic feel to it. The walls are lined with all the reviews and awards it has received. Value: 4/5It was $28 for a regular pie (8 slices).

We opted for the slices because it was a shorter wait.  I have to say that it doesn't matter the wait time, it is worth it.Yes, the decor of the place is not eye worthy and the place needs an uplift but Di Fara is one of the spots that you dont go for decoration, you go for the taste and art of how Dom makes each individual pie with TLC. Also, that bug situation outside of the pizzeria, what are they?

922,Vahid R.,0.0,5,"For a video review check out this video: youtube.com/watch?v=fSkU…Di Fara Pizza is a pizzeria located at 1424 Avenue J in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, New York City. It has frequently been on best pizza lists with Bourdain stating it is the best of the best. It was also named #1 Zagat rated pizza 8 years running for New York. The cost for a slice is 5$! That means for a whole pizza you are paying 40$, actually there is a discount for getting a whole pie. It's 30$. Domenico DeMarco is the proprieter of this establishment and his Neapolitan pies have thin crusts with a char and hint of Parmesan that are made by hand. Get the original cheese. We ordered the original cheese and the crisp crust that come with nice charred parts tastes delightful.",3/11/2016,3,103,0,9H7ynsSE5E-213AG5_OMHQ

I think due to the influx of countless visitors, there's a lack of effort dedicated to the pizza making. Every time I had pizza from there, it was burnt. Personally, the sauce on the pizza was good and flavorful. It had that homemade taste to it. But the pizza was thin and not worth the price ($35 for a whole pie- rip off) or popularity at all.

Everyone said that you should eat the pizza right away or it's not as good. But if I paid $5 a slice for pizza, I better be able to eat it whenever I want and have it still be amazing!

I am from Austin, and if you know anything about the Texas Capitol you know the people there will wait hours for food, so I wasn't too bothered by the wait, but my New Yorker born boyfriend was. During our wait we crossed the street to Isaacs and bought some chocolate Babka.. Delicious! I would highly recommend including babka if you visit Di Fara, you will have plenty of time since there is no line there! So if asked if the pizza was good, I'd say definitely yes, if asked if its worth the wait, I'd say it depends on what type of person you are.

People waiting for their pizza - from LUNCH.  Some had already been there two hours.  Some had ordered multiple pies and had received 3 out of 4, or 2 out of 3, so they continued to take up valuable wait-space, even though they had already eaten (these folks annoyed me the most, as they already had pizza in their belly).  If the man can only make a few pies an hour, shouldn't they limit how many can be ordered per party?  Anyhoo...  We put in our order at exactly 4:25pm.  By 5pm, they were only taking orders for slices.  By 5:30pm they were not taking ANY further orders that day.  MORE THAN THREE HOURS BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY CLOSE.At around 6pm - technically the START of dinner service - a family was told no more orders, even though they had driven from the Bronx to check out the place (!).  But they stood firm - no more orders.   They wouldn't even sell them a slice.  It was disgraceful.  Our 4:25pm pie was finally served up at 7:05pm.  We ate it greedily in the corner.  It was good, but we were so hungry by then (having skipped lunch thinking we'd be eating much earlier) that I'm not so sure it was sooo delicious or we were ravenous.Moral of the story is:  Go insanely early.  Go when you don't even want pizza.  That way, by the time you get some, you'll probably be hungry for it.",8/12/2013,46,163,3,ehR5ieUf_2M4V51rroT5ag

The history makes it alluring, he uses fresh ingredients, the pizza IS GOOD and he's the ONLY one making the pizza which is kind of the point right? But just a bit overrated.... This is a classic spot that used to be something amazing. A divey pizza spot that only the locals knew about, but as soon as it got some publicity things got a little out of control. BE WARNED even if you are only the 5th person on line it will still take up to 2 hours to get one pizza. He also doesn't open the restaurant on time... Ever... But I guess you can do that when you're a pizza legend (don't get me wrong I'm totally cool with this). Also, I'm sorry but the prices are just not reasonable. When we went to pay I was shocked! This is really just a Brooklyn experience that you only have to do once. Make sure you're dressed appropriately for the weather because you will have to wait outside and go with a group of friends to kill some time on the line. Also, if you're on the fence about ""I think one pie should be enough for us"" just get two. The pies really aren't that big. Plan on eating it somewhere else because there is barely any table space there. If you haven't been here yet then totally go for it, but you most likely won't want to do it again. Oh yeah, and don't even try calling in an order. After a certain point they just don't even answer the phone (we asked one of his daughters that works there). Yummy pizza, but just not worth going through more than once :).TL;DR: Good to do ONCE, the wait will feel like eternity (so bring friends with you) even if you're third in line, don't bother pre ordering by phone, expensive.",10/25/2015,31,27,18,DSxrIBHJsmuhg46KBxKBAQ

Maybe I just went on a bad day. I even heard the lady at the counter constantly remark about how bad the pizza was coming out. I finally got my slice. Which was a ridiculous 5 dollars and it was the worst slice I've ever had in New York. I've been to Italy.

We got there about an hour before opening and the line was already wrapped around the block. We got in line and when the doors open we were luckily in the first batch of people that were let in. After coming in you will notice that the spot is nothing fancy and just place your order and sit. It took about an hour for the pizza as Mr. Di Fara is the only one making them. After seeing your pizza, it does look extraordinary and it was piping hot. After taking a bite it was satisfying but just did not justify all we had to go through to just get to this point. The pizza was good but waiting probably almost 2 hours in total to eat in a crammed up room for pizza is not just worth it in my opinion. I won't complain about the price as you should be free to charge whatever you want as long as you have the demand. We got a pie to go but it just wasn't the same at home. In all I would still recommend giving it a shot as it is one of the best and the same pizza might not be around longer. For me however, I prefer to just have my pizza delivered by a local joint and eat it in my own apartment and comfort.

Close second has chunks of garlic, and semi dry cherry tomatoes which pack a punch.  the sicilian is no slouch either..I even tried a marinara slice with roasted onions, roasted peppers, and, pepperoni.Dom is a master of his craft, and the staff here were awesome in accommodating me and my group of friends.",6/4/2015,195,128,1,qbktBg_kKKbaWFk6r1f2Zw

We ended up waiting for about 2 hours for our pizzas (we were initially told ""over an hour"", which proved to be a little light, but it is what it is) and managed to secure seating for our small group. There are only a handful of tables, so definitely not some place you want to come with more than 6 people, and 4 is even a bit tough. The pizza itself is decent--the toppings are all very fresh, but the excess olive oil that is generously applied pre- and post-oven makes it a tad soggy; our first pizza was largely unable to be held by the slice due to its soggy-ness in the middle. The ingredients are all very fresh (sauce and cheese especially), but the dough itself is fairly unremarkable and not really edible to eat on its own. I've since heard you can call ahead and order in advance, and then maybe then it's worth the trek out here to eat some pizza.

I would have given this place 5stars but I think that 5$ for a slice of pizza is a bit expensive and they are regular size like any other pizzeria slices. On top of that the you have to wait about 30-40mins for the slice. They're well worth the wait just the price makes this a 4star especially because of the size of the slices but in taste this is 4.5stars. Dom still has the great passion as he did 40years ago!

968,I B.,0.0,2,"I grew up in Midwood and lived there for over 15 years. During my time in Midwood, Di Fara's pizza has always been a neighborhood establishment. I've eaten there several times and I've been to every famous pizzeria in the city. This is probably the most over-rated pizzeria in all of New York City. Yeah, the pizza is pretty decent, but it seems that people are more caught up in the ritual that Dom goes through to prepare your pizza, or the fact that you have to wait outside in a line for almost an hour, or the fact that you're paying $4.50 for a slice, than the actual taste of the pizza which is average at best. The slice is oily, salty and pretty decent, but that's best I could do. The reason I'm giving this place two stars? Because I don't care for paying double the price of a slice anywhere else and waiting in a huge line so that I could get a slice of pizza that any other good pizzeria makes equally well. If you want mind-blowing pizza, there are much better places to go, which also happen to be cheaper.The only people that go here and are willing to put up with these annoyances are tourists and hipsters whose sense of taste solely depends on hype. If you think that paying hugely inflated prices for average food is more your thing, try the Williamsburg Smorgasburg, its closer to where you live and you don't have to wait as long. If your time in NYC is limited and you want to try an authentic New York slice of pizza, go to Totono's, Grimaldi's, Luciana's or really any place with an Italian sounding name. It won't be any worse than Di Fara's and your wallet wont take such a big hit.",7/31/2015,2,21,0,742Jg2LjpdU229oE4KK1bQ
969,Frank M.,0.0,2,"A previous review talks about how the ""artisan"" owner ""banged"" out pies for all these years.  ""Banged"" is hardly the word to use when the man takes 25 minutes to put cheese on a $30.00 pie that is OK at best.  I grew up a couple of blocks away from this place and this was our ""local"" pizzeria. Also, it is worth noting that 40 years ago he was just as slow.    I was in my old neighborhood today and my wife wanted to suffer me the experience of getting her a slice.  With six people in the place people told me they were there over an hour waiting for a pie.   I get the fact that over the years this place got a lot of buzz and it is every hipsters' dream to own the bragging rights to a DiFara's slice but there is much better pizza in Bklyn. Lucali is worth the wait, Totonno's is worth the trip and wait but this place is not worth either. If you really need to say you had a DiFara slice and have no problem being gouged $5 for a small, ""just ok"", slice then go and try it.  Bring a book, a few magazines and a folding chair for your wait.",5/6/2015,1,18,0,sZUXei3NHuWk_KegW-vWoQ

972,Crystal C.,0.0,3,"I waited two years to come here -- until I was in the neighborhood, the time seemed right and they were open. I was aware of the hype. I think that, overall, the pizza is excellent -- but it's only marginally better than some of the other really, really good places in NYC and the price and the hassle are far, far less at other places. I even got there, and by some miracle, rolled right up to the counter and got two cheese slices in about 30 seconds -- but if I had to wait, I would think it would not be worth it for the price and the madhouse that is the neighborhood -- even though there was not a line for the pizza. The pizza crust is very good -- the first bite was perfect -- that thin-soft thing with the crunch just right as your teeth come together. The ingredients were superior. The outer crust was just okay -- no seasoning and a little too bready. Had the cheese fallen more to the edge and the pizza cooked just a bit more, it probably would have been fine. It is salty, but I like that -- so that didn't bother me at all. I feel those commenters are correct who say the potential hassles, price and size of the slices figure in to the overall review -- the pizza is definitely one of the best -- but the experience could probably be better.",10/8/2015,56,34,0,bTPjSvsbQtYBIBRrEb2MpA

We were able to order right away and ""only"" waited about an hour. the inside of the small shop was totally cramped, but it smelled of amazing basil. My friend and I only ordered one slice each. When they finally came out, they were smaller than I had expected, especially at $5.00 a slice. The sauce, cheese, olive oil and super-thin crust make for an absolutely delicious mess of a pizza. I had to inhale its awesomeness, lest its ingredients accidentally slide to the ground. The basil was the best part; I wish my slice had more. My chief complaint is that the crust was so charred in one spot that I had to throw that small piece away.Still, the pizza was tasty, the place is an institution, and I felt like a fangirl watching the owner man do this thing.",11/16/2013,348,553,36,WQnfyig39Xg5ni98ci-VBw

From hand grating mozz to snipping basil with scissors, the entire process takes way longer for the payoff.We got there on a sunday around 4pm. Not too many people in there but that is very deceiving. There is no pizza ready. Everything is made to order. Dom makes one pie at a time (duh). If there are 3 or 4 whole pies in order ahead of you, you will wait a long time for a pie ""for slices"" come out.  Most of the time, 1 or 2 pies for slices are already spoken for before they are even made. Where a young buck in a neighborhood pizza place can create a pizza in about 2 min, for Dom, it is more like 5-6 min. He takes his time. There is certainly enough business to run a second pizza making station, or get someone in there to make them faster. Its like watching White castle make one burger at a time. Come on! No reason for this.We were told it would be 20 min (more or less) for 3 slices. It turned out to be 45 min! Finally, we got our slices. You would think you would have an epiphany eating the slice but sadly, we thought the pizza was below average. Lots of oil in top. VERY average. To think we waited 45 min for a slice, ate it in 4 bites, you really have to have your head examined to do that a 2nd time.Never again. Don't believe the hype.",5/9/2016,1,86,4,NUhdjHcKOkqhYsHk-jZKJw

978,Dave G.,0.0,5,"A few years ago when I came to NY to find the best pizza, I went to Lombardi's and Grimaldi's.  I got quite a few yelp comments saying ""Hey what about Di Fara's?""  It seems it's a 3 team race for best NY pizza on many message boards, so I knew the next time I got back to NY, a pilgrimage to this Brooklyn pizza spot was in order.  What I didn't know was that the word pilgrimage is exactly what it would feel like.Dom DeMarco has been hand making each pizza here since he opened in 1965.  Nobody but him makes the pizza.  Sure some help with prep, but the actual making of the pizza will be done only by him.  I'm guessing he's about 80 years old and watching him slowly work his craft, spreading of the dough until he has just the right shape, the slow circular motion of spreading on the sauce, and then the same motion for the olive oil - the singleminded attention to detail on his face as he goes through these perfect motions, it was like watching a Zen - Buddhist Master raking a Japanese Rock Garden.  There was a serenity to his work that seemed to spread throughout the small pizzeria.  No music playing, no TV blaring, in fact everyone seemed to just sit quietly and wait for their pizza.  Anything more than a whisper seemed out of place, like this place should be treated as holy ground.  Shhh the master is making your pizza, you wouldn't interrupt Mozart composing, or Da Vinci painting, and in this building, Domenico DeMarco commands such reverence.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…We were told by his assistant that it would take an hour or so to make the pie.  I came over 3,000 miles for this pie, another hour would be just fine.  We ordered pepperoni, sausage, and onions.  My initials of DG was written down on a little yellow pad and we waited.  Dom was only given one order at a time.  Only when he was done with the specific pie, would he request the next.  Regardless of how busy Di Fara's gets, this system keeps a calm working environment in which greatness can be achieved.  Surprisingly the hour went quickly and the moment of truth arrived.The pizza is more of a traditional NY pie here, very charred crust from an extremely hot oven.  Cooking time is quick, prep time is where all the love is.  That and the amazing ingredients.  San Marzano tomato sauce provided a slightly sweet sauce, which balanced nicely with the oregano.  The cheese made this pizza much different from Lombardi's and Grimaldi's where they choose to use slices of fresh mozzarella.  At Di Fara's, Dom DeMarco has gone with a blend of 3 different types of Mozzarella, as well as a salty Grana Padano and Parmesan Romano.  This gives his pizza a bold flavor.  The crust is perfectly crunchy and charred just right.  Top notch pepperoni and slices of sausage were delicious.  Extra Olive Oil is poured on the pie, which also adds some richness that separates it from others.  Fresh basil is cut just before being served, which always provides a wonderful aromatic experience as you are biting into your pizza.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…There's only one size here.  And that is the right thing to do. The pizza must be allowed to breath, when you have too small of a pie, the crust chokes off the topping area.  Cut into 8, me and my friend had no problem finishing off our 4 slices each.  I even managed to try a square Sicilian slice, just to say I did.  I found that one a little too blackened on the bottom for my taste, as the olive oil just fried the pizza dough in the hot oven.  However my friend loved it.  First time here - go with the traditional round pie.  yelp.com/biz_photos/di-f…If Lombardi's Pizza is number 1, then Di Fara's is 1A.  It's very hard to pick one over the other, even though they are very different in taste.  I'm so glad I got to experience Di Fara's, it's truly a foodie destination.  Don't expect much in terms of how the place looks though, all the love is put into the pie.  There's only perhaps about 10-12 seats and they're pretty run down.  But I found that part of the charm.  (Closed on Monday and Tuesday so plan accordingly)",2/20/2015,507,495,1204,Bt6gmjnWHPERhiOTQOhuEA

981,Pizza M.,0.0,2,"What compels a man write his first review ever? This: my experience today at Di Fara pizzeria was so underwhelming relative to my expectations that I nearly had an aneurism. Summary: called in a pickup order on an early Sat afternoon and was told it would take 35 mins. In actuality, it took 1 hr and 35 mins before it was ready. Look, I get it. It's Di Fara Pizzeria. It's a very good tasting pizza. The old guy making pies moves so slowly it's like watching grass grow. So slow, that it's actually an entertaining marvel. That's part of the charm, er excruciating deal. But Jesus. Don't guesstimate a 35 min ETA, realize you're going to blow that estimate out of the water by 200%, and continue to manufacture pies destined for ""single slice"" in front your valued, call-in type guy's order. Yes, there are bigger problems in the world (ISIS, mothers who don't vaccinate their kids, and Rick Perry running for President). But come on, man. Don't tell your customer he's overreacting. You're charging $30/pie and $5/slice. Kiss the customer's bum a little when you blow his ETA out of the water. We have other options! In a related note, after voicing my displeasure about the wait, I then had to endure verbal judgement from other customers waiting for their' za. ""What's up with this guy? Doesn't he get that this is Di Fara mutha-effin pizzeria? He's got to wait 1.75 hrs for his pizza without complaining."" I'm talking about you, Brooklyn Joe and Mrs. Smarty Pants from Sheepshead Bay, who probably consider yourselves regulars, or are accustomed to poor service, or are just plain too obtuse to be able to rationalize the time value of money. And, oh, after getting home, I discovered we got the wrong pie. Bottom line: very good pizza, but way too long of a wait and too expensive to justify ordering again. There are too many other great pizzas in Brooklyn to justify going here again. Poor marks for customer service, as well. Yours Truly, Pizza Monster",3/7/2015,0,10,4,YC0gdzNEJ3UKAnO9qOx5Uw
982,Thomas Joseph P.,0.0,5,"On the corner of Avenue J and east 15th street lies an old school pizzeria called Di Fara Pizza. Domenico DeMarco is the pizza master behind the counter and watching him make your pizza is a treat. I always go with the square pizza because it is the best in all of New York in my opinion. You wait on line for them to open, you place your order and wait some more for your order to be completed. The way Mr. DeMarco grates the cheese on the dough, the way he uses the olive oil above and below the dough, the way he snips that fresh basil on top of the pizza after it is removed the oven... it is a pizza symphony and Mr. DeMarco is the maestro. Every second is worth the wait but make sure to get the square pizza for 34 dollars. At 6 dollars a slice, getting the pie is the best deal. Come hungry, come packed with cash, come willing to wait hours if need be, come watch maestro DeMarco make magic and send you into pizza heaven.

I live just a few blocks away and I never even heard of it.We placed an order for a pie and were told it would be about 40 minutes. After 40 minutes of walking around Avenue J and sitting on the bench outside, I went inside to see how much longer it would be. I was told there were 3 pies ahead of ours. About 20 minutes later, I went back in, waited in line, and asked for an update... still 3 more pies ahead of us. We were starving so we cancelled our pie and took out 5 slices.There is only one other pizza place I've ever eaten at (including pizza spots in Italy) that would compare to Di Fara. Di Fara's pizza is cooked to perfection with an utterly delicious, crispy crust. The owner cooks each pizza himself - no wonder why it takes so long but it's SOOOOO worth it.

Cons: $5 for a slice is too much, anywhere.  Even a fancy, sit down pizza place with a great scene like Lucali's or Co. Pizza will give you more for your money than $5 a slice and this place is more of a takeout pizza parlor, I'm not even sure if they have table service. But unlike other pizza parlors that can get you in and out quickly, it takes a while to get your one or two slices.  Conclusion: In the end it's a very good slice, I went once, loved the pizza, but the cons just outweighed the pros for me to go back since, when there are other places that are very good that provide a more enjoyable experience.  I still had to give it a 5 though, because the quality of the pizza is top-notch, even though it's kind of downhill from there.",10/3/2012Previous review,21,220,51,41Nug8PQrJCS40sjEpH53w

I was finally able to make the trek out Midwood over the summer, and even though we arrived a bit after 5 pm, the line was already building up and all of the seats were taken! We put in our order quickly (for two pepperoni slices and one mushroom) and waited for about an hour. It was fun to watch Di Fara pick basil off his basil plant to put on the pizzas, form mozzarella balls, and carefully place pies in the oven. Overall, I thought the pizza was pretty wonderful, but I didn't think it was the best I'd had in New York. I think the hype and wait time also took away from the experience. It was still fun to experience and I would recommend it!! It's definitely still a gem of Brooklyn and it won't be around for forever.",6/8/2015,313,147,1108,Bar3at_6cHUag4u2AzRX5A

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.In terms of which type of slices to get: we both thought that regular slices were better than square slices. Square slices are chunkier (more cheese) but the regular slices taste better. I guess the pizza is unique in that it's coated with lots of parmesan cheese and olive oil--but that can make almost anything taste better.I love sun-dried tomatoes, but they were wayyyy too salty as a topping. They made my slice super duper salty. Glad I finally got to experience Di Fara's (I'd heard SO much about it), but probably won't be coming back again.

The staff was friendly although I was a bit disappointed that  Demarco Sr. was not there to make the pizza himself. I was hoping to try it before he hands down the throne. The pizza was superb nonetheless and the cutting of the fresh basil with kitchen scissors adds remarkable flavor. The toppings are delicious but are served in small portions. (Add two dollars for a dab of the soppressata on an already pricey five dollar slice). It leaves me to wonder whether the pizza would be any different if it were made by the elder DeMarco.

1005,Hunter P.,0.0,2,"Di Fara is one of the most famous pizza places in the city, mostly for the perception that Brooklyn is the king of pizza and that because this is the best place is Brooklyn, then it must be extremely good.Also, you want to see the old man do his thing.On the list of ""tourist"" things to eat, a slice here is right about where Katz or Carnegie is at -- a fun thing to do.Randomly, I found myself walking through Midwood and literally came across the place. Of course, being hungry, I stopped in. It was just after three on a Tuesday or Wednesday. The place had a few people but there was no line.The old guy, Dominick, was there and his children were the ones doing all the business work. I swear that the guy looked like he was about to die while I was in there. He appeared to be propped up like a puppet. He was doing his thing.As for the pizza, it was pretty much average. I don't know -- I'm sure it's different on the weekends when the tourists come down. The workers there gave zero shit about me and my pizza was barely warmed up. It seemed to have been sitting there cold for some time, almost as if it had been prepared a few days before.It was pretty brutal, I have to say. You can go to fifty places in Brooklyn and get something better. Pizza is pizza, anyways.That being said, the place is mad famous and the workers probably do better then any place in the city, so why would the people there care about a random guy coming in mid-week?",4/13/2015,0,20,0,2NyYqoMrxpnmdIhejzqcQA

Thanks to taking  Scott's Pizza Tour  six times I was able to try some of the best pizza's in the five Burroughs. So I have a little pizza knowledge. Unfortunately his tour did not include Di Fara's so I made the trek alone.After reading the reviews about the long wait because Dom is the only one making the pizza I decided to go on a Wednesday during a non rush time. Fortunately when I arrived there was only a couple of people inside. I ordered a larger pepperoni pizza and ate four slices and took the other four back to my apt.The pizza is not your typical slice like Joe's or a Neapolitan like Kestes. It is like in between.The slices I had were excellent. They were greasy which I like because of the pepperoni and the olive oil he drizzles with. You can tell all the ingredients are fresh and the pizza made by the famous Dom which I found intriguing just not another pizza maker but a pizza celebrity. He doesn't use a pizza paddle to pull the  pizza out of  the oven. He uses his hands. I guess he has been making pizza forever that his hands is used to the heat.This is by far the best pizza I have ever had. Like I said not typical NYC or a Neapolitan. If you want a slice bursting with fresh olive oil, basil and excellent cheese this is the place.Go on a weekday after the lunch rush otherwise the line is out the door.

I had heard a great deal of hype about this place from them, so I went in with high expectations. My experienced surpassed my expectations in ways I could not even imagine!Dom DeMarco, the little old man who grabs the pies out of the blazing oven with his bare freakin' hands, is the man. Seriously. The pizza is, by far, the best I've ever had. The place looks like nothing from the outside, there are approximately 5 tables in the joint, and there is absolutely no ambiance. But who needs it? Here are some things you should know before coming here. 1. Be prepared to wait. We arrived at an odd time where there was no line out the door, and we still waited an hour for our pizza. Apparently, that is nothing. Waits can be closer to two hours at rush times.2. Do not come here if you want to grab a .99 slice. Plain slices are $5 a pop. Insane right? I'd agree with you, but I've eaten it and am officially a convert. Shell out the $5, you will not be disappointed.3. Bring cash. A lot of it. We ordered two pies and 2 slices and it came close to $70.

If someone blind tasted me on ten pizzas, I might think this was ok but I wouldn't think it was worth writing about. Were it not for the Eric Asimovarticle which led to people thinking this was some ancient institution, it wouldn't be a big deal. Talk to some people who grew up in Midwood in the 60s and 70s - I have - and they haven't heard of the place.On to the pizza itself - massively over oily. The crust was good but the oil quickly overwhelmed it and caused it to give way. The basil was great when you got it but it was so sparingly applied as to be inconsistent. This parm/grana padano snow everyone mentions seemed totally absent. Not sure what was going on. The pizza was slightly elevated NY slice. Standard greasy gas-oven oily shredded cheese affair.Oh and BTW - it's pretty clear Dom isn't making every pizza himself. Sometimes he's just sitting there in the back being grumpy.Compared to the actual great pizzas you can find in this town - Juliana's, L&B, Emily, etc. - this one is not worth the trip. And I say that as someone for whom the trip was about 15 minutes. Still not remarkable.I'd eat this pizza again sure, but I don't know without being forced to believe this was great that I would think anything of it.",8/21/2016,6,157,6,vV3Yh-z6SxL8wxizVh87og

1015,J C.,0.0,5,"NEWSFLASH: I had a pie here on Tuesday NOT made by Dom DeMarco. It's the first time I've ever seen it. Also, don't listen to Yelp, they're open on Tuesdays now. Always check their Facebook before making the trip because they do switch their hours sometimes. I think it's his son who was making all the pies today, I've seen him in there assisting the old man over the years. We're all better off if the next generation can make pies just like Dom so I'm pulling for the guy. Firstly, it seemed like a more efficient set up. Dom wasn't the fastest mover and always handled everything himself. His son is able to get the pies in and out of the oven quicker and also received a lot of help from the other guy working behind the counter as far as setting out the dough and clipping the basil leaves at the end. I went in on a Tuesday afternoon and was told a half hour for my pie but got it only fifteen minutes. That's by far the fastest I've ever gotten anything here. It seems like his children are a bit more business oriented considering the additions of MD Kitchen, Dolce FATTS, the Di Fara branch in Las Vegas and even just updating the menu in the shop. It's good that his son is open to other people helping him behind the counter as it should allow things to run a bit quicker in there. I can already hear what you're all thinking: is this the first step towards a commercialized, rushed, soulless Di Fara? Are they now going to become the Apple of pizza shops, charging double the amount based on name recognition and trendiness for a product you could get for half price if you're just willing to look less cool doing so? (sorry, Apple fans, but truth is love)The good news is that the pizza was very similar to what we're all used to. The sauce and cheese were exactly the same as when Dom cooks. The only difference was the crust, which was far too thin towards the middle of the pie and too thick towards the outer edge, as well as being undercooked. The normal Di Fara pie always has a good char or is just flat out burnt.  This was very chewy and doughy towards the outer crust, almost closer to a Neapolitan style crust than you would get at Roberta's or Zero Otto Nove. For that reason, right now I'm giving it a four instead of the customary Di Fara 5 star review and will update the next time I get a non-Dom Di Fara pie. One final note: don't be the toolbag that walks in, orders, than loudly starts complaining about how ""it's not the same without Dom"" or asking the guy about to make your pie, ""Hey, why isn't Dom here?"" We get it, we're all very impressed with your pizza expertise but stop being a foodie hipstee and just his children live. They've been working with him their whole lives and they don't need you expressing disappointment before you even take a bite.",12/23/2015,1,10,4,630PbLoHlUs4GST90iVESw
1016,Mike O.,0.0,5,"Came here yesterday on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, and the place was still elbow-to-elbow, yet not spilling out of the doors. I looked around and quickly surmised that I was going to have to watch a bit to figure out the arcane and unspoken rules and mores of this establishment. Here are some things I determined.-don't talk. if you do, don't do it very loudly. you should be in awe of what you are observing. when the by-the-slice pizza is ready, be prepared to hold up your fingers for how many slices you want.-talk. you need to figure out if the people next to you have put their order in. if they have, you can elbow your way to the counter where you can wait to put in your order. you should definitely speak when spoken to. quickly.-read. look closely at the menu and make some inferences. there are three kinds of pizza, regular, white, a square (sicilian). know what you want so you can order it when your turn comes up.-don't read. impossible. i have a very liberal view of reading.-watch. you are in a special place observing a true artisan. Domenico DeMarco is in his 80s and has been making pizzas like yours for decades. a shiver may go down your spine when he makes an occasional glance back and looks you in the eye.-don't watch. close your eyes. just smell everything.-hate. get it out of your system: why is everyone being so reverential?! is this pizza really that great!? what is this, like, the Soup Man? good lord Brooklyn is so eye-rollingly full of itself. would it kill anyone to start a line here? could there be MORE cyclists in spandex here?!-love. you need to get any possible hating out of your system because what you are witnessing is truly special. you will repent.-walk. you might go nuts standing around for an hour, which is as long as it might take for your za to be ready. don't worry, there is interesting stuff nearby. Woody Allen's childhood home is like two blocks away on Rugby Ave, and nearby are some interesting Hasidic and Syrian Jewish neighborhoods. You'll be in awe but also realize why about 1.1 million NYC citizens, about one in seven people, are Jewish.-stay where you are. how awful would it be if you missed your order. get back in time to find a possible place to sit or decide if you're taking this stuff to go.-eat. when your pizza is ready, hopefully you will have gotten a seat in the small place. take it to your table and enjoy. I had the square sicilian with pepperoni and sausage. The pan it's baked in is slathered in olive oil, which makes the crust super flavorful. The San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce were nicely sweet and acidic, the buffalo mozzarella cheese from Casapulla was creamy and gooey, freshly grated grana padano blended nicely with the mozzarella, as did the hand-grated Parmigiano Reggiano, the Israeli basil scissored onto the pizza at the end was perfect.-don't eat. let that stuff cool for a solid 4-5 minutes or you'll burn your mouth and ruin the whole experience. A large pizza is big enough for 3-4, or get ready for amazing leftovers.Worth the trek. Worth the wait. Worth the price. Get here before an era ends.",4/19/2015,211,1720,570,cuVrNmt7_WtBn1uz5L_p0g

There is a chance that some of your crust might be a little burnt (Mr. DiFara is old, busy, and still mostly doing it on his own). Yet despite what a freaking pain in butt it is, this place is *always* busy (even super early on weekdays-we've tried), 'cause the pizza is worth it!I personally think the plain square pie is where it's at. Get a whole pie--a whole pie is the only thing that can make all the pain and suffering worth it.

I split a regular slice with a friend while we waited, and that only took a few minutes to come out but was a little disappointing. I did like the spiciness of the red sauce, but the crust was too dense, such that the bread teetered over ""crispy"" and towards ""hard."" The cheese was ok, good but not oozing of fresh mozzarella like other places. BUT the Sicilian style square pizza was heavenly. This gigantic ethereal sheet of molten sauce and cheese took an hour to come out but it was pretty amazing. We got ours with prosciutto, which was a bit too salty, but every other element else was great. The cheese was pretty gooey, the sauce was excessive, and more importantly, the bread was fantastically fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside. Pricey pies, inconvenient seating, the wait, yadda yadda but it all is counterbalanced by being able to see Domenico work behind the counter and do everything by hand.

1040,Becky H.,0.0,4,"The place is known to have a line outside the store for a good reason! I lined up when the store reopened in the afternoon and waited around 20 minutes to get my food. There's a picture of the old man making the pizza, which is the same man making the pizza in front of you. Thought that was a neat thing to peak into the history of their business.The ingredients are very fresh, but the pizza is drowned in oil. I prefer the regular slice becuase the Sicilian is more doughy than I would typically like. ALWAYS eat the pizza right when you get it. I decided to eat the pizza at home after a twenty minute bus ride and it tasted like i was eating a sponge consumed with olive oil. The slices are pretty overpriced, but I would still purchase. You practically have to fight for seats in the local shop. It was still a good experience and I would go back to this business!",9/13/2015,134,36,7,VOQEJYbY7-OhDgG6QUlAYg

1046,Don B.,0.0,5,"There are experiences, and there are life experiences, and there are life-changing experiences. Technically they're three shades of one happening, and what happened to me here falls squarely within the latter. This is fairly life-changing pizza. It's good. Really damn good. Downright incredible pizza. Some of the best if not best that I've ever had. These folks follow the tried and true method of doing one thing and doing it well. There are only a couple of options here, and you have to know about them to order them. Otherwise you order a pie, or a slice. It's hand-tossed dough, marinara, fresh mozz, and olive oil baked to perfection, then topped with fresh basil, more olive oil and grated parm. It's simple. It's made to order. And it's downright perfect. I guess you can get a square pie with thicker crust. You can get meat added on if you know that's an option. And, well, they do sell some sodas. But it's all about the pizza here, and the same guy has been doing it for ages. The downsides to this concept are immediately apparent. They open when they want to. They move as slow as they damn well please. And they only accept cash (as far as I can tell). Also this joint is way the hell out in Midwood, which is a trek for anyone from anywhere except Midwood. On the upside, the people-watching here is excellent. We made a pilgrimage here and showed up on a Sunday afternoon, to find the gate down but the window open, and a group of people hovering out front. It took maybe 10-15 minutes to make my way to the front of the line, and another few to converse with the dude writing orders on a lined paper pad. The quoted wait for a pie was two hours. Two. HOURS. But since we come from way out west, and made the trek, we waited. It took the full two hours for our pie to arrive, and was it worth the wait? Yes. For many reasons. First, it's delicious. The sauce, the flavors, the fresh basil, the crust... all good. Second, it's delicious. Third, this was my only chance to get it. If I lived in town, would I do it again? Sure, occasionally. But now that the taste of this pie is indelibly imprinted on my brain, I can always sweetly recall the wonders I experienced when consuming this pie while I wait a much, much shorter time somewhere else. But I'd still make it happen. Dom's only going to be slinging pies for so much longer, and I'd want to get as much of this in my belly as possible before he's done. This is serious business folks, and it takes serious dedication to do business here. But if you appreciate good food, it's your line of business.",9/9/2014,2866,2351,1691,Pf7FI0OukC_CEcCz0ZxoUw

1049,Anthony L.,0.0,1,"This was a TERRIBLE experience. I came here with some friends from out of town after hearing the rave about the amazing pizza that the 85 year old owner makes and after close to 3 hours wait time for two pies; our pies weren't even made by The pizza maker himself. We were told that the pies would be ready in 45 minutes but this was definitely inaccurate. Not only did we wait almost 3 hours but they were already catering to a party inside. How do you operate as a business if you cannot give your customers the honest truth on an estimated wait time. If you're catering, have it organized so you know how much food you'll have and need. They were catering to the party inside while trying to serve those waiting on the outside, mind when the people outside were under the impression that they would only be waiting 30 minutes. If you don't know how long it'll take to make the outside customer's pizzas, don't serve outside of the party! They lack the ability of knowing how to pace themselves, very disorganized and very unprofessional. I don't know how they ended up on the Food Network but this place is not worth the wait one bit. Their pizza was mediocre at best given the reputation they were given. Had we gotten the pizza made from Mr. Di Fara himself, it may be a different story but they weren't. So my verdict, long wait, mediocre pizza, terrible management, terrible customer service. If you want to waste an hour of your time waiting for this place be my guest but I wouldn't do it again.",7/3/2017,3,2,0,Da98JheU2LpkSX64nSez1g

Better than any pizza I would ever have in my life. So, naturally, my expectations were high.I was told there will probably be a line. Eh, I'm not really into lines. But I was along for the ride. Sure, let's go. We get there at 11:15 anticipating a line. None! Awesome! So we go hang out nearby to use WIFI so I can get a little work done.We return at 12:03, and there's a small line. But not out the door, in front of the door. Not open yet. Meh, whatever, they'll unlock the door soon.10 minutes passes. I'm apathetic. At least there's not 100 other people waiting.10 more minutes. Okay, this is a bit weird. We see the people milling about inside in no particular rush to let us in.Finally, 30 minutes late, they open the doors. At this point, I'm pretty frustrated. I have little patience for establishments that don't treat their patrons with respect, and making us wait outside for 30 minutes just felt like a power play. At least let us come in, order, and have a seat and a glass of water. Standing outside for thirty minutes in 90 degree heat while they took their merry time prepping made me feel like a complete idiot.But maybe the pizza is incredible, and maybe I'll only bump one star for their refusal to open on time.Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.We got a whole pie, half regular half classic, and waited another 35 minutes. At this point we're starving and grumpy and watching other people enjoying their slices while we sit in the incredibly muggy interior of the restaurant. Naturally, I started scoping out what people were eating, and I got concerned. It didn't *look* like great pizza. The crust wasn't blistered and it seemed like it had very little sauce. And it looked greasy--REALLY greasy. Finally our pizza comes out and there's just a huge pool of oil in the middle. Still trying to keep my hopes up but losing faith.I take a bite of the regular, and--Meh.It's fine. It's pizza. The sauce was no where to be found, the center was totally soggy, and the crust tasted like nothing. We were both really disappointed that such an unpleasant experience resulted in such mediocre pizza. We just kept looking at each other like, ""are we being punked right now?""Don't get me wrong, this pizza is not BAD. If you want to eat a famous slice, go for it. Do not order a pie, and try to go around lunch time during the week to avoid a terrible wait. You can try to call in advance to see when they are opening that day, but they don't seem to be too concerned with picking up their phones.PROS:EAT A FAMOUS THING (??)Fresh cut basil is a nice touchThe sausage on the classic is goodFriendly service (once they opened the door)End of listI'm sorry New York, but you're gonna have to try a lot harder if you want to impress a pizza-addicted Philadelphian like myself. Beddia and Tacconelli's put this place to shame. Seriously, not even close.

Someone who has never tried it must try it at least once in their lives but I do not know about multiple trips. You will wait at the bare minimum for 45 minutes in a not so clean place but people say it is worth the wait. But once you take off some of the oil the taste is amazing.

I don't even think he sells slices, and if he does, they are old, because everyone orders at least one pie lol.So anyway this is like gourmet pizza, with the finest organic ingredients, and the best pepperoni in the freaking world... and its all in this small little corner store that people wait for hours around the block!I mean, of course, it sounds completely insane, but their pizza is damned good, lemme tell you.  The old guy cuts the basil onto your pizza ever so gracefully, its so cute, he takes it so seriously.  And I guess it payed off for him.I've heard that the place has been shut down several times due to failing to comply with city health mandates. Bleh! The place does look a little dirty, i dont know if anyone who works there knows what a broom is.  If you can get you're head around waiting for a minimum of 2 hours, (unless you come at a random time like 11am on a Tuesday), and don't mind the fact that they're been shut down dozens of times for unacceptable board of health regulations, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DI FARA PIZZA!

The vibe is old school pizza place and it's very calm and quiet when you step in.  The owner makes all the pies himself and has 1 person taking orders.  He's very methodical and you can see how much attention he puts into each pie. It's best to come right when it opens because it gets busy fast and seeing as he doesn't move as fast as the amt of people walking through the door, your pizza can take some time.  Also, the pies are pricey but so worth it.  Don't just eat 1 slice.

If he is not there, there's no pizza. That also means there is a limited number of pies made each day. If you watch him, you'll notice how carefully he assembles each pie. It's pretty amazing.  He uses fresh ingredients, mostly imported, several different kinds of cheese and tops it all off with a generous drizzle of olive oil and fresh basil. The pizzas are cooked in a very hot oven, which gives them a crispy crust and a good bit of char. The result of all of these steps is a very savory, rich, and flavorful pizza. It's got a nice salty bite to it as well if you're into that sort of thing. I have tried both the regular pizza and the Sicilian. Both are good, but I prefer his Sicilian mainly because I think the extra crust stands up a little better to the overwhelming flavor of everything else. To me the Sicilian is a little more balanced, which I like.",1/20/2016,398,474,103,sNn49OwMPUBhMfozyGz2zw

1082,Fred N.,0.0,3,"Worth a visit, but I would get over excited about the place. Before I start the review, you need to know that you must clear at least 2 hours or more to eat here. There is a crazy line, and the place is always packed. Again, why it is packed is beyond me, the Pizza is good, just like many other good places in New York. The place looks like it standing like that since the day they opened, which is cool, and the pizza here is really made from fresh products. But the amount of oil you get with each slice is what made me know that I don't think I will visit here again (Unless my hipster nephew will come to visit this summer). Cutting Basil with scissors over your pizza is not something you see every day, so like I said, the place is cool, but not that cool that I will wait 2 hours for a Pie.",11/2/2015,13,38,22,6YOk07MNLuLskCdv1VhR0A
1083,Matt K.,0.0,4,"Went here on a Saturday night in the fall around 6pm. No line, but an hour wait for 2 pies, which makes sense because Dom only makes the pizzas by hand one at a time. We decided to walk around the neighborhood, grab a drink and come back.Given that it was the Sabbath and Midwood is a primarily Jewish neighborhood, literally nothing outside of Walgreens and 7-11 was open. Not that it would have mattered because there are no bars in what is mostly a residential neighborhood. We grabbed some beer at 7-11 and brought it back with us to the pizza place, which is cool with the owners there.The pizza itself is quite good, if not a bit pricey even for New York. Word of advice: let the pizza cool down a bit before jumping right in - not only will you avoid burning the roof of your mouth, but it won't turn into a sloppy mess if it's settled a bit.At the end of the day I would not have waited hours upon hours for this pie, but if you go a bit earlier than 6:30, you shouldn't have too much trouble getting some quality pizza from a local legend.",10/31/2016,2,16,0,HJDPV2AvlvHGtrJyd2Yn5Q

I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I have been to Di Fara's pizza twice and both times I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes which is ridiculous and already makes it not worth it (Very surprised people think its the best ever...). The pizza is very very good but definitely not the best (pricey as well). I also understand the old man who cooks there adds to the atmosphere however they really need to get someone else cooking as well to speed things up...

Mushroom, sausage, onions and the freshest basil you can imagine! Basil gives off a strong aroma which is a nice differentiator from other pizza places. I'm no high profile food critic so I can only say this pizza indeed tasted special. Watching him make the pizza and eventually eating it, hits you right in the feels! Like this pizza reflects decades of experience. Pizzeria operates in an interesting way. The place revolved around Di Fara since he's the only one making the pizza. Place your order and, generally, pick it up later. It's based on when he gets around to making it. I came when there was no line at 5pm right when they close briefly for an hour. I later found out, he was taking a nap. Understandably, he's an elderly guy, so take all the time you need buddy.

That's what happened on my birthday night a couple of weeks ago here.It felt like a miracle, some kinda pizza miracle, to not witness that winding line- cause I've done that move before too: waiting and waiting and watching Dom DeMarco expertly forming pie after pie, as a son keeps track of all the many orders on his yellow legal pad. Oh I'd wait for it, but it was sweet to not have to queue it up forever, this time.I appreciate expertise in life. That'll go double on the pizza tip, cause the ole gal loves her pizza. Pizza expertise is happening here. There's been a one-man show of it for about 50 years at this shop on Avenue J, happening in front of your eyes while you wait and watch every pie made, pulled outta the oven, and every snip of fresh basil scattered on top. This man slides the Sicilian pans off the peel with the side of his thumb. That blackened sheet was just in an 800 degree oven. Brick thumbs! Ole brick thumbs, I'll call 'im... By the way, I do love the square slices here too, but my top faves would have to be the regular thin, crispys. Yeah definitely just like everybody and their mamas I like The pizza from DiFara. Mozzarella di bufala, Italian tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil, crunch... I'm in.Well anyway, as a pizza lover, and a lover of experts doin things expertly, mark me down as one who has a soft spot for DiFara.

Unfortunately, word got out that this was one of the better pizza joints in the city, despite the hole-in-the-wall exterior. Supply and demand being what it was, Dominick decided not to compromise each pie by expanding, choosing instead to use the expert touch that made his pizza so unique to begin with. This, though, led to a very high price markup, to the point where it's now five dollars for a slice. Also, I don't know if it's the cloudy nostalgia talking, or the fact that Dom has less time to perfect each pie, but it just doesn't quite measure up to the pizza slice I remember as a kid. It's still delicious, but not worth the five dollar bill. For my pizza cravings, L&B Spumoni Gardens and Del Mar are my Brooklyn go-to spots now.",8/5/2014,183,4,0,nJyHMTPm0qZSsz13ufhqkA
1108,Greg A.,0.0,5,"I grew up here in the NYC area, with many great pizzerias, but Di Fara outshines them all. Every ingredient is the absolute best you can get. The crust is thin and well-cooked. The sauce is incredibly delicious. They use a couple of different cheeses that are so flavorful. Once the pizza comes out of the oven, the owner (who makes every pie), drizzles some high quality olive oil on top, and cuts fresh basil and puts that on top too. When you taste it, it somehow is a flavor explosion and melts in your mouth all at the same time. The toppings are amazing, but my favorite is the plain, round pie...you can really taste the ingredients more without anything covering them up too much.Well worth waiting on line, but if that wasn't enough, they have private parties right in the pizzeria! I've been there for two parties already with my soccer team, and we were all treated like family. They will make any pies you want with any toppings right there on the spot.

I ordered their a slice of their regular special? It had sausage, peppers, onions, and bail on it. My partner ordered a Sicilian slice. I think it was about a 40 minute wait to order and then a 30 minute wait to pick up. They are extremely popular and I can understand why. The pizza is very good. I felt bad for everyone behind the counter, they seemed really beleaguered. I think it's family owned and operated and from what I saw, there were only 3 members running everything. Dom even took time to autograph a t-shirt. I think the place is cash only. I didn't see anyone paying with credit card. I like that they pour a bit of oil over the pizza afterward.

Everyone I spoke to said good things about Di Fara and I was hyped to give it a try. My friends and I ordered the DiFara Classic Pie which had green peppers, mushrooms, red onions, fresh basil and sausage. This pizza tastes exactly what a mom and pop shop (in this case a pop shop) should taste, delicious. The combination of fresh ingredients was on point and was well balance. The pizza crust was crunchy with just the right amount of give and the center wasn't too oily. You definitely feel better about eating this pizza over your regular pizza joint. Now comparing this to pizzerias in Staten Island, Di Fara has upper hand. The overall balance of the pie was second to none. It just slightly beats out Denino's Garbage and M.O.R. pie (which imo was the best out of the SI spot).

The sauce seemed different than the regular pie too.  It was pure heaven!  A few minutes later I heard the magic words again.  T.S.  Pizza ready for T.S.  Score again!The regular Di Fara Special came out next.  Dom was chopping my basil and asked if it was my pie.  Told him, ""Yes sir and also wished him a Happy Fathers Day"".  He smiled, said thanks and then said ""enjoy"".  You could see in his eyes he loves what he does and thats why hes been doing it FOREVER and does each pie with love.  It truly does show and hes a master at his craft.  Im glad I got to try out his masterpieces.   Back to the pizza....The Di Fara Special has sausage, onions, mushrooms and yellow peppers on it.  This thing was just as amazing as the square....different, but just as good.  They are both so unique, you have to try out one of each.  You could pick out each individual topping as you went through each slice eating it.  The thing that stood out the most though was the other cheese besides mozzarella that he put on.  Whatever it was it had a great nutty taste and I kept wanting more and more.  Just a great pizza man.....easily in my top 5 ever!Total damage wasn't cheap by any means.  2 pizzas and a Coke came out to $65.00 or so but you know what?  TOTALLY worth it!  The pies are large too...between 3 hungry dudes, we brought back 2 slices of the round and 4-5 slices of the Sicilian.  Well worth it and I'm glad I got to try this place.  Its totally worth the trek down to Avenue J and to have to wait for a little while.

And to all the reviewers whining that you had to wait, and the ambiance is not all that great, you miss the point. This is a man who has perfected the art of pizza over more than 4 decades. He's not going to be rushed, because he's not going to offer an inferior product. The 'hole-in-the-wall' atmosphere is all part of the charm.So whiners -- seriously, go to a new Pasty's or Grimaldi or whatever, where it is all about expanding the business based on the brand -- and not about the pizza. You won't have the wait and you will have an ambiance more befitting of your 'bland, no surprises, I consume whatever is trendy, then tell everyone how much I love it to be cool' lifestyle. No seriously, please go somewhere else, so my wait for Pizza perfection is even shorter -- and better yet, I don't have to hear your snot-assed whining.For everyone else -- this place is sublime -- seriously.",11/21/2016,0,15,0,ItLfiXbj7IyPvKupXO5Etw

I had a cheese slice for $5. My husband has pepperoni and mushroom.

Came back at one, and had to go to the sweet shop around the corner as private party still going on. Watched a single pizza at a time get walked down the street to the sweet shop. Watched a lot of people that had been in line behind us get their pizza. Told 3 times that it's in the oven. Told one time it must be the toppings we ordered- we ordered a cheese round pie with pepperoni on half. Told one time it got burnt and needed to be remade. Finally got it at 210p and it was barely cooked and no basil. Was advised by staff there to ""go see them"" pointing up the street. No one on window of shop and couldn't get in the door. I could have gotten a better pizza from 100 or more shops in NYC in a 10th of the time for half that price.

1156,Jando S.,1.0,5,"There are pizzerias in every direction in New York, but the finest pizza may just be in Brooklyn. Lots of wonderful pizza, but only one Di Fara. Some people would prefer it this way, but few would disagree Midwood's greatest asset is a pizza lover's dream. The experience is far from perfect, but imperfection is practically part of their charm.Despite owning and operating Di Fara's for the better part of four decades, Dom DeMarco still churns out pies with his bare hands, carefully mastering his craft with each pizza, topping them off with a little olive oil and freshly snipped basil. He might be at times slow, but with a little patience and appreciation, a pie made by one of the pizza gods himself is a real treat.There are some issues at hand that many folks just can't seem to get over. Yes, it's far in Brooklyn. Midwood is no place to enjoy post-pizza festivities and coming 40 minutes outside of the city can be torture for those who have a hard time leaving 14th street. It's also cash only - at $5 a slice and practically $30+ for a pie, hardly makes this budget pizza. They have odd hours, sometimes delaying their start time and will close for 3 days straight at a moment's notice. They rarely answer their phone and a wait of 30-40 minutes is completely normal.But knowing those things ahead of time makes it easy to avoid the pitfalls and nix most surprises. Bring lots of cash and bring a drink of choice (BYOB!). Split the pie with some friends or shoot for pizza on the go. Don't just show up and get a slice unless you live in the neighborhood and are just coming by for a casual bite. Those who do this are destined for instant disappointment - long subway rides for an expensive slice of pizza is a recipe for disaster.And though I do love their regular slices, I think there is a better bang for your buck by going strictly Sicilian. The hearty square slices, along with my favorite toppings of sausage and pepperoni, three cheeses and fresh basil make for a helluva pizza. It's tasty, fresh, and for me, worth the wait. The old adage of ""good things come to those who wait"" has never been more true.When Dom decides to hang it up and enjoy the high life, it will be the end of an era. While I'm sure Dom Jr. (who is often seen helping out) is also a master in his own right, his father has established a pizza legacy that has put their family business on the map. With that in mind, it's best to enjoy what might arguably be NYC's best pizza while you still can.",3/9/2012,2762,3563,17271,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ

Would not eat there unless in the area. As a suggestion, I would say the guy taking the orders should take off the glove when handling money. I saw him cut the pizza, and it gives off a bad feeling watching him handling money and handling food with the same glove. The pricing is higher than most other places.

We went to Di Fara, Totonno's and L&B Spumoni Gardens. The result of the contest and the review of Di Fara is below.AND THE WINNER IS: DI FARA PIZZA.With a grand total of 134 points, Di Fara dusted the other two worthy competitors in this contest (L&B 115 points, Totonnos' 98 points). Some of the comments made by my panel of expert judges about this extraordinary pie included:- Superior crust, although comments were mixed on the slightly burnt nature of parts of it- Delicious sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese, with the right amount of each.- A rich flavor that was way beyond the somewhat bland taste of the other two competitors.- The addition at the end of some very good olive oil drizzled on top, and fresh basil cut with a scissor and put on the pizza at the end took this pie to places unheard of in the annals of this totally ethereal foodIt was agreed that even though this pie was $28, it was worth every penny.Di Fara totally and completely rules.... and to say that this pizza is legit is almost a laughable word to describe something that totally eclipses the expectation that you would have for pizza or anything else for that matter. While we didn't get to go to John's on Bleeker St., or Roberta's due to time, one of those other joints would have to serve up something totally and completely amazing to unseat Di Fara as the best pizza on the planet. There are just no words to describe how good this pizza is., and while the words 'masterpiece', 'work of art', 'Fuckin Aye', 'off-the-chain' come to mind, the only words I have to say are - ""Its the best there is""..... and as my friend Ira put it ""Andy, I can't eat pizza no where else.

1169,Lisa Z.,0.0,5,"Okay, for starters, this place usually consist of long lines of people buying slices. Let's disregard my first visit here... I wasted 25 minutes waiting for just a slice and wind up with nothing. The second time around, things happened  a lot smoother: I had just arrived a minute before their break in the afternoon. (They're so Italian, it makes them old school!) This time I had to wait about the same time, but left with a slice. From having just one slice, I'm seriously addicted to their regular slice. (I'm just not digging the idea of $5 per slice.) I absolutely love their crust -- it's not too chewy nor is it too crunchy -- it's perfect. The texture of the crust is so distinct that I don't even think I have had anything like it before. (I'm comparing their pizza to Denino's and Joe & Pat's on Staten Island.) On top of the balanced texture in the crust, their regular pie contains of basil, sauce, cheese and more cheese! I was star struck on my first bite: it was just so good, it's making my mouth water as I am writing this review. There was an even amount of everything... If it's the old italian man making your pic, nothing can go wrong. Bless this man for being old and still making that delicious pizza for us. TIP: If you're coming here just to try their pizza, bring a friend and an appetite! Paying $5 a slice is absolutely not worth it, unless you're utterly desperate. A regular pie only costs you $28. Grab lunch or dinner here with a friend, and make sure you have it fresh. I can't guarantee the pie be still be good after it cools off or gets cold.",8/4/2014,10,46,6,BhOj_1tqFy44sClWIcy5NQ

1172,Jenny N.,1.0,2,"This is near my old house. Growing up my father and uncle often buy pizza from here and my dad would bring my bro and I here. This place brings back a lot of childhood memories. The pizza use to be $1.50 a slice or something around there. This was the only italian pizzeria amongst all the Jewish pizzerias and stores around Midwood area. This shop is the only one remaining here for decades while all other stores on Ave J disappear over time. Hence thats why this place is famous. I have seen the pizza man age and make pizza for years. I guess his sons didn't want to follow suit thats why you see him (in his 90s) still making them.  But let me just say, the pizza here use to be the best in the neighborhood back in the late 80s and early 90s. It was all the rave... but as time went on, the fame of the place drove the prices sky high to $5 a slice and made the slices super thin, lacking cheese and added way too much oil for comfort. In the past, the slices where thicker, the cheese was plentiful and the oil was in appropriate amounts. Before in the early 90s they deserve a four star rating, now, they only get two stars and thats just being nice. Their pizza now, I wouldn't even want to eat it even if it was free. I tried it twice and was appalled by the cost and taste. Go else where. This place is not as it once was.",12/18/2015,194,215,3567,XiSKibEw--0irAnTaCotbw

1178,Dave K.,0.0,4,"This is pretty much the best pizza I've ever had. The experience starts by arriving early enough before Dom finishes his nap and takes up another shift for let's say dinner service. You will wait about 2-3 hours pretty much no matter when you arrive, because Dom at least as of my writing of this review, is the only man who I've ever seen make the pizzas. His family is there playing support roles, making all the toppings and attending to the customers' orders, while we get to watch the Picasso of pizza weave his fine art. From the Buffalino  mozzarella to the 750 degree oven, every little detail is just right. I've watched Dom working and if there was one really good trick among his many that really informed my own cooking technique over the years, it's the casual improvisational style he invokes as he throws the toppings onto a pie, letting them land unevenly as they may, without any concern for order and fairness. So if you're eating the pizza, maybe you'll get a slice with lots of sausage, and maybe you won't, but each bite will be just a little more fun because not every bite will be the same.As Dom checks then removes the cooked pizza from the oven with his super calloused bare hands, he places the newly born masterpiece on the counter for all to see, then he grinds some fresh Parmesan cheese and with a beatific smile on his face he spreads that on. Then he goes and gets a cute little copper kettle of olive oil and sprinkles that on. To top it all off he grabs a bouquet of fresh basil (or oregano if he is out of basil) and with a little scissors, snips pieces directly onto the pie.One irony about this place is that it is nestled right in between a bunch of kosher establishments on avenue J. For many years, since my childhood, I would visit this very block with my religious cousins and eat at what has to be the worst pizza place serving undercooked kosher food being called pizza with strange cheese that I can't call Italian just a couple doors down the block. I never knew about di Fara until only about 10-15 years ago, but I'm so glad I know about it now.Updated June 2015I'm sorry to say I was underwhelmed with the pizza I got today... It seems that Dom is getting on in years, and sometimes forgets to put all the stuff on he used to.. I had to ask for the Parmesan cheese.. The pie was not as well cooked as I have seen in the past... The cheese and tomato was slipping off the crust... The cheese didn't seem to be as good as I'd remembered from past visits... I'm afraid the food here has gone from the best to just reasonably good... But not great... It might have been a fluke just this day... Nobody has all perfect days, but I was a little embarrassed when i brought a friend from out of town and the pizza did not really meet expectations.",6/16/2015,278,8,17,IKnfQIcE8nJZ0q4dtELfzA

The result is a gateway drug induced pie to heavenly quarters of the earth. The love put into each inch of this creation is definitely shown and the taste says no different.

1182,Anthony D.,0.0,5,"Di Fara has really made a name for himself in the NYC area and for good reason. As New York's first $5 a slice pizza, It's truly a title that Di Fara of all places has earned with their testament to consistently delivering a quality product.The lines out the door really speak for itself when it comes to their pizza. People aren't kidding when they say be prepared to wait, overall from getting in line to shoveling pizza in my mouth, I think we waited a good 1.5-2 hours.Inside you'll find old man Di Fara diligently and lovingly making each pie from scratch. From spreading and tossing the dough, layering on sauce, adding fresh cheese curd, cutting up fresh basil via his vintage kitchen shears, and setting each pie in his circa 1986 pizza oven. His son will take your order on a legal pad with a pen and a system that clearly only makes sense to himself and tell you exactly how long you'll have to wait for your slices.As for the slice itself, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said. crusts are thin, well done on the bottom, but nice and firm on top while retaining all of its flavor. The sauce is really savory, it's hard to describe really but I could taste it on my tongue for 20-30 minutes after I ate it. It plays well with the cheese and basil which were just cooked to absolute perfection.There's something admirable about a man who takes it upon himself to truly master the art of doing one thing and then ensuring that it stays consistent no matter what. If you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

I went when I was sure it wouldn't be crowded (it wasn't, really, near closing time; I hear that the other thing you can do is to plan to be there EXACTLY when it re-opens at 4). But it was still a long wait, and it's probably not worth it to again, when in Manhattan, there is slightly-less amazing but still pretty-darn-good pizza (like, for example, the Sicilian at Artichoke Basille's -- ignore their crappy signature slice and go for the Sicilian) is much more easily available, without a wait.As for expense -- well, it's a $5 slice here, but if you're buying a pie, the prices start to even out.

1211,Fred P.,0.0,5,"I grew up in Brooklyn and we have a certain sense of ""Brooklyn Exceptionalism"" when it comes to things such as Hot Dogs, Bagels, women who drink and curse like sailors and, of course, Pizza.  My childhood was spent thinking my local pizzeria, Victoria's - yelp.com/biz/victoria-pi… - was the greatest purveyor of Italian gastronomy outside of Southern Europe.   And while Victoria's will always have a special place in my heart and palate, the true king of all Pizza is a little old pizzaiolo in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Midwood: Dom DeMarco of Di Fara.Dom - the obvious offspring of a torrid and fantastical Italian love affair between a San Marzano Tomato and mountainous pile of Buffalo Mozzarella - lovingly hand makes each and every pie himself with a spritz of imported EVOO and a healthy handful of basil and other fresh herbs trimmed from his windowsill box.I've come here with friends on several occasions and waited as long as two hours just to devour a sometimes half bunt pizza, but it's always worth every second of the wait.  I can't begin to describe the sensation which will run up and down your back as each patron preceding you has their order filled and your's gets closer and closer. (You're absolutely mad if you think you won't pay attention.)The crust is thin and crispy, and the sight of near burnt dough may make you cringe initially, but it's actually meant to be that color.  The sauce is a light and savory mixture of San Marzano tomatoes and the cornucopia of imported cheeses leaves you begging for more despite the obvious fear of a fat-induced coronary blockage. Plenty have attempted to explain the flavor explosion you'll experience at Di Fara.  It's like describing a sunset to a blind man, it can't be done adequately. Just take my word for it, you need to experience Di Fara's pizza at least once.  Get past the wait (and lack of seating) and you'll be hooked.Some have scoffed at the $5 per slice price tag, but they need to recognize that Di Fara is not in the business of selling slices.  Drop into California Pizza kitchen and ask for a slice...they'll laugh at you.  Now, I'm obviously not equating Di Fara pizza to CPK, the point is that selling slices is a luxury to Di Fara.  Totonno's doesn't sell slices, neither does Lombardi's.  If you want to experience a fresh slice of goodness just cough up the $25 for a plain pie with extra fresh basil.

Whether you're a Di Fara's loyalist or not, most people will agree that they deserve a spot amongst the legends of pizza.The crust is crispy yet soft with a great crumb, chew, and flavor. The tomato sauce has a slight sweetness that contrasts beautifully with the saltiness of the fresh mozzarella. As Dom pulls each pie out of the oven, iconic fistfuls of fresh basil make their appearance as he carefully snips basil leaves over the steaming-hot pie. Another quick drizzle of olive oil and his masterpiece is finished.Now the dirty little secret... You're going to have to wait. A very long time. Ok, this isn't a secret at all if you've done any research, but you need to prepare yourself. This is NOT a quick grab-and-go situation. Your best bet is to reserve a pie ahead of time. Be aware that if you reserve a pie for, say, 4pm, that doesn't mean your pie will be waiting for you at 4:01pm. Dom is one man (an old one for that matter) and he's the only one making pies. Sometimes things get backed up and you'll have to wait beyond your reservation time. This is not unusual for Di Fara's. Loyalist and supporters like myself have learned to accept it.Be aware that seats are incredibly limited and often given to customers that ordered full pies as opposed to slices to passers-by. Sometimes Di Fara's will host private parties and the dining area will be closed to patrons. They will still take customers through the walk-up window. Be prepared to eat standing up or on the move if that's the case. You can usually check their Facebook page to see if a party has been reserved to help you plan accordingly.If you're feeling lucky, you can walk up without a reservation and try to get a slice or put in for a pie, but the wait times are often well over an hour. Last Sunday my girlfriend and I were fortunate and got two slices in about 40 minutes while a private party was going on. I was very surprised. Every time I'm in New York, I try to make a point of clearing a spot on my schedule for a Di Fara's pilgrimage. It's one of my favorite food spots in the world.",6/1/2014,5,13,3,Y0RwfCvF6usS5jMPd5fI6g

1218,Evan M.,0.0,2,I still don't get it. I just don't. People are like sheep I guess. I thought I would give this place another chance to figure out why anyone would want to pay $5.00 for a slice that is half the size than any normal slice. Two slices here is a light snack. Pizza purists and Zagats alike continue to call this the best pizza in NYC. It's good but not great. Reputation and longevity does not justify the price markup. I think the only competition this place has in the immediate area is a kosher pizza place. It was also pretty greasy for such a small slice. It's a thin crust that is very similar to the margarita slice at Artichoke's. I know two stars is pretty harsh but this pizza is just decent and doesn't live up to the accolades. I would give it three stars if it wasn't for the outrageous prices. To the people that disagree: I think I have a bridge I can sell you.,2/10/2012Updated review,96,320,158,AkAbdFcW_xtTnwB-89vr8A

He uses canned tomatoes from Italy and fresh basil that he cuts with scissors for every slice. What else he does....who knows but it makes for a slice so different from everything else around. Entering this divey little place you'd never guess world class food is served up daily...so don't be fooled by the decor. But, if you're  a New Yorker you already knew that.The quality of this pizza cannot be overstated. Whether you are visiting New York City or are a native, you owe it to yourself once at least in your lifetime to go to this place. Your first bite, you will realize why people line up around the block.The reason I only give 4 stars is that wait for even a single slice of pizza is brutal. You get to a point where you don't care if the pizza gives you 50 orgasms, it's just not worth 45 minutes+ or more for a slice. However when that pizza touches your lips, the forgiveness comes fast and leaves you with that lingering italian taste that makes you dream of going back the very next day.",6/7/2014,0,39,0,LqCCmTRtM-cRcR86HVUVaA

1235,Dan L.,0.0,4,"Part of the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars because its famous and that's peer pressuring me into up-rating it.  Really its a 3.5.  I'm going to keep the 4 however because 1. it is famous which gives it a coolness factor that a normal pizza place doesn't have and 2. because it had an edginess to it that said ""We don't give a crap that we are famous, you'll sit at cheap folding tables along the walls and pay $5 a slice and youll like it.""  Usually this attitude annoys me, people who think they are too big for their britches gets on my nerves.  In the case of Di Fara's I think its just all about the pizza.  You walk in, aside from the countless articles raving about the pizza framed on the wall, there is no frills.  It could literally be any pizza place.  They have a hodgepodge of tables laying about with not enough chairs to go with them, most of them are of the folding table variety, the kind you would set up in your back yard during a family gathering.  This is clearly the kind of place where the owner/chef cares solely about the product and only has seating because it is necessary.  Its probably kind of the same rational for why he gets B (and sometimes shut down) ratings by the health department...he just wants to make good pizza and doesn't want to deal with the fuss.  (of course, I'm speculating, but that is the vibe I got from the place).  The key is the pizza.  Its not fancy, It is just very fresh.  The basil on top was crisp and nearly perfect,  The sauce had a good balance.  It wasn't too greasy.  It was just top quality, basic, simple pizza.  If you ask for cheese, they literally dip a dixie cup into a bowl of Parmesan and hand it to you.  Does it deserve all the praise and the $5 price tag?  eh I don't know.  I think its the kind of place that when it was unknown it was better.  It was a hidden gem where you knew that you could reliably get awesome pizza and then all of a sudden it got famous.  Its kind of like that kid everyone knew in high school who was an amazing baseball player, a hero in his home town, he eventually gets drafted into the majors and coasts into obscurity as a mediocre player.  That's what Di Fara's is.  It's fantastic, and it is everything that you want pizza to be.  And it must have been awesome if you lived near it and that was your pizza place before it became famous. Now, I'm not sure if its worth waiting in a crazy line for.  I luck for me, I went on a Thursday afternoon and didn't wait a minute, so for that, it was great.",5/29/2014,167,92,34,OOPgZdfA-Cr5SRhcZQQObw
1236,Dana L.,0.0,4,The sauce on the pizzas is amazing! Chunky tomatoes in a savory thick paste.

I like a nice crispy slice. Not burnt. Big whooping deal that Dominic is the only one allowed to make the pies. Maybe if he let his daughters make some pies the lines would move quicker. Wow, he throws in a couple of freaking bay leaves that he grows himself on the window sill. During the summer days, you can see him making the pies with his sweat dripping off his nose and chin into the pies.And the topper to this is he charges FIVE DOLLARS A SLICE!!!

1246,Luna L.,0.0,4,"Dom DeMarco carefully crafts every pizza. He has one guy working the cash register and taking down the order on a yellow legal pad and another guy in the back. He starts off by getting dough and shaping it into a circle. Then he adds tomato sauce and chunks of tomato. He then takes some mozzarella and slices them onto the pie and adds whatever topping on the order. Then he drizzle olive oil and puts the pie in the oven and checks on it occasionally with his bare hands. His arms are covered with flour. Then after the pizza is cooked he drizzle some more olive oil, snip off some basils, or add extra cheese. The wait is long- anywhere from half an hour to an entire hour. The service is slow and they even sell t shirts that say ""it's worth the wait."" Service is not friendly, more like take your order and wait. This place is always full. The classic Difara pie has onions, peppers, sausages, and mushrooms- cost $32 tax included. I recommend this. The peppers taste marinated and this is really good but not the best pizza in the world. It is on the soggy side but still good.One slice cost $5.They have spicy red chili peppers that you can add yourself on the counter. Its cover in foil and it is contained in a white mug. This is a must try. It taste great on the pizza. I recommend this place and it is fun to watch him create pies. Even Bill Debalsio eats here according to the article they have on the counter. He says this is the best place for pizza. There is not enough seating here. At most this place can seat 15 people. Also when you order, just go up to the counter and tell them your order and your name.

1255,Kathy C.,0.0,3,"A place to visit once in your lifetime if you're a Brooklynite and love pizza! I must admit that this was NOT the best pizza ever. Hands down the best part of both the slice and squares was the crust. The slices were thin and crunchy. The crust for the squares were thicker and crunchy as well. The problem that I had was the sauce being a bit salty for me. I prefer more sauce than cheese so it gives the dough/crust a nice soft crunch; but the tomato sauce was making me thirsty. I also got the classic pie with sausages to gave me even more of a salty punch. Hello blood pressure!Another reason why I had to knock down another star is the wait time. Since I wasn't completely blown away by the pizza, the 2.5+ hr wait kinda ruined it for me. They do a summer siesta between 5-6:30. I got on line around 5:50, doors opened at 6:50 and didn't get to eat until after 7:30. I appreciate the old man Dom creating each and every slice all by himself, so I like the hard-working aspect of it. As others have mentioned the price is high for pizza. We spent about $45 on a classic pie and 2 squares. That's some luxury fast food (except it wasn't fast nor located in the city). I guess I paid for bragging rights.

1262,Brandon S.,0.0,3,Been hearing about di fara for long time. This review is solely on service not the food.  Came on a Saturday about 11:50 ; there was a line of about 10 people.At around 12:00 some guy came out and said there going to be late by like 20-30 minutes. after that it was another 20 min. There is no doubt the pizza is great and probably the best but no respect for costumer. I understand you open 6am and your late but opening  late at 12pm there is no excuse. Frankly they don't care since they are well known and people will be coming. I had to try it and may be back sometime since I live 10 min away but defiantly won't come before opening. When I was leaving the line was not that much bigger when I came in. If your opening ours are 12 don't open 12:50 Especially on Saturday.,11/22/2014,18,42,18,UvCo4ZFIij51B-737Q-E7w

1267,Anthony F.,0.0,3,"I know I'm probably going to be shunned for this, but honestly? I'm not sure what all the hype is for this pizza joint. We arrived here on a Saturday afternoon to find the place jammed. Granted, this is in the middle of a heavily Hasidic part of Brooklyn, so nothing else was open. My friend informed me that we'd probably have a good 45 minute wait before we got our pie, but that it would be 100% worth it. Order placed. ""Come back in two hours!"" WHAT? Dear LORD. Let me tell ya folks, if you're hungry and in this part of town on a Saturday, you're kinda screwed. Starving, we ended up finding a Thai/Japanese place a subway stop away where we nommed on appetizers while awaiting the pizza. Returning two hours later, we were greeted with ""it'll be ready soon!"". So after a full two hours, still not done. But this will be worth it, I've been repeatedly told. An additional 45 minutes later (that's two hours and forty-five minutes in total, for all those keeping score) our pizza was done. We rushed back to my friend's apartment and dove into the pie. I say dove because there was enough oil on it to fill a swimming pool. I'm talking soggy as can be. You couldn't lift a slice without everything gracefully sliding off, leaving a dangling crust. Now, gripes aside, the pizza was delicious, which is why I'm giving it a 3 star ""A-OK"" review. Was it the most delicious pizza in the city? No, not by a long shot. Will I return? No, probably not. The cost alone would have me barely returning even if the pizza was phenomenal. Over $30 for a pie and $5 a slice. That's way too expensive.",1/24/2014,85,380,130,xZfssbFXzM3-sGQPj44R5w
1268,Peter M.,1.0,4,"total time capsule eat. this is probably the best cheese pizza slice that I have eaten so far. if you weren't intentionally looking for this place, you'd never think that from the outside it was special as it looks like any generic nyc pizza place. decor probably hasn't changed at all since it first opened in 1965. everything here is old school. dom demarco makes the pies in open view, pulls pizza's & calzones out of the oven, the cashier hand-writes the orders, and there are about a dozen seats in the place that haven't been replaced in a long time. If you have ever watched seinfield, there's an episode about a crepes shop called ""magic pan."" it turned out that the ""magic"" in magic pan came from the fact that a person from the owners family had to roll each crepe. that's exactly what is special about this place. dom has to personally ""bless"" each pie. pretty amusing and amazing. I admire dom's passion for doing this for as long as he has. god bless. was in the neighborhood today and decided to take the dive. there was no line forming outside the door so I thought that was a good sign. wrong. I placed an order for a cheese slice and waited a good 30 minutes or so. some guys ordered two pies and was told that it would be about an hour. but was it worth it? the cheese slice is $5. pies are $30 plus. it's a touch greasy, but yes, the cheese slice was pretty awesome. the blended cheese worked well with the sauce and slightly salty dough. and watching dom and the workers in action and how people waited and waited for their turn to eat some special pizza was pretty captivating. I wouldn't want to wait for this or pay these prices on a regular basis, but if you have time, this is a definite treat.",2/21/2016,272,415,888,nVhkUbfTTIC9QSEiiFWtMQ

We arrived to a neighborhood where every business except for Di Fara was shut down. We saw that some people were sitting inside with wine they had brought in, so after ordering our pizza, which they said would be about 45 minutes, we set out to find a wine store. Found one about 25 minutes later, came back, and our pizza was finally ready an hour and a half after we originally ordered. It was so smoky inside the restaurant that our eyes were watering. Tell you what, though? That pizza was goooood. I can't say I'd do this very often, but it was a fun experience.",1/31/2016,1,54,0,26sXwp1-sn7hemipkBPWJg
1273,Will C.,0.0,4,"There's a lot of hype surrounding this place. So I just had to witness for myself being kind of a self-professed pizza snob. So I took the Q train all the way down to Avenue J, AND NOT TO SEE CONEY ISLAND. JUST FOR THIS PIZZA. hopped off the subway, and found myself on Avenue J. And, but for a Game Stop and Walgreen's, this is the only establishment of note on this side of the subway! The ordering means is chaos. There's no set lines, you just move yourself to the counter, get your order placed. It's all made fresh to order. I ended up waiting 40 MINUTES for my two slices of regular w/ pepperoni. When the pizza comes out, Dom sprinkles it with parmigiano reggiano, fresh basil, and EVO. I think the pizza's very good, and rates a 4.5. Tomato sauce is very smooth, light (not chunky), very inoffensive, and fresh. The crust has just enough bite to make it crunchy, but also very foldable. Not quite the best NY slice I've ever had, but certainly rates very good. I'm personally not a fan of the extra parmigiano that goes on the slice. I think it's unnecessary, makes it a bit too salty, and might even cloud the otherwise subtle flavors of this pizza. Perhaps a true litmus test would be to just try the pizza as a 'virgin' before she's been deflowered. Pizza slice at $6 is rather small as well for what you pay. And, let's face it, walking through Avenue J to kill some time while you wait for your pizza is just like walking through a ghost town. Just about every store is locked up. Luckily, this place is right off the metro. While you're waiting, you can stare in the direction of the subway so that at least there's some illusion of civilization. Several customers in front of me had a pie that was just horribly burnt through 1/2 the pie. It's surprising how inconsistent these pizzas come out despite THE ONE CONSTANT: THERE IS ONLY ONE DOM MAKING THEM! After eating through half of the pizza, one of them wanted her money back. Which was kind of absurd... you just ate through half the fvcking slice, but the guy handling the cash register obliged. Good on him. So I guess I consider myself lucky to have two non-crispy slices. If you're a pizza connoisseur, I think it's worth checking this place. If you're not, you just may not understand what the big deal is. And, you'd be right. On the surface, there really isn't much that separates di Fara's from any other pizza shop in NYC. Overall: Would I come here again? Only if I had no place to be and all the time in the world. What? Who in NY has that kind of time?! Pizza is a 4.5. But, this place is just way too far a trek. If I have to wait 40 minutes for pizza, plus 40 minutes at least round-trip from Manhattan, it'd better be worth it. Honestly, as good as the pizza is, it didn't blow my mind. NOT WORTH THE WAIT, but because it is pretty darn good pizza... a solid 4 stars.",3/5/2012,79,260,92,0FUp_4coC1MxoyujWhDdIA

1276,Minette Y.,0.0,5,"I'm usually pretty skeptical about pizza places that get raved about. Naturally I was super skeptical of this place because its reviews come littered with hyperboles like 'hands down,' 'best ever,' 'the ultimate,' 'magical,' 'oh, I know my pizza and THIS PLACE is numero uno' (okay this one was directed to me verbally by a random enthusiast when I walked into the crowd and hesitated; it was accompanied by an unneeded wink). Don't get me wrong, I definitely always enjoy pizza when I go to these list-topping places, but find it hard to understand how any pizza can REALLY inspire soo much passion. But for the pizza at DiFara's, I get it.First of all, there's Mr DeMarco. The little old man obviously takes a lot of pride in his pizza, and he is literally the only one behind the counter running the oven (though a helper runs back and forth from the kitchen with rolled out dough and crushed tomato sauce before Mr DeMarco showers it with cheese, pushes it deep into the oven and then nearly sticks his head in the oven to inspect that all is bubbling nicely.They quoted us an hour when we arrived, so like most of the others we put our name down and left to do some exploring of Midwood in the meantime. We returned 40 minutes later, a bit nervous we had missed it but there was no need to worry. It ended up actually taking an hour and half or more, so we staked out a spot at one of the folding card tables.So here's what I think really makes the pizza so great: While it's still steaming out of the oven, Mr DeMarco drizzles the entire face of the pie with olive oil, cuts whole leaves of basil on top, and silently pushes it across the counter. Underneath the just-wilting basil, pockets of mozzarella, and salty chunks of parmesan you'll find crushed tomatoes still intact. Any olive oil that slides off the top should be directed into the tray for later - I used my airy crust to sop it up and then dunk that whole thing in some parmesan (ask for it on the side!)",1/4/2014,43,188,10,TNNRmOheG5PFV7qXop151A

1278,Julia M.,0.0,5,"I still dream about this pizza. As a Brooklyn native I had long heard it was the best of the best, but it wasn't until recently that I made the trek with my husband and some pizza loving friends. One of our group was a vet, and he knew the secret: Get there by 6:30. They close to clean the ovens in the afternoon after the lunch rush, and open again around then. We still had to wait a bit, but by the time we were chowing down there were about 100 hungry eyeballs staring longingly at our pizza. I almost felt guilty. There aren't may places to sit, so it's another reason to get there early. No frills, just big card tables and folding chairs. Taking it to go might mean more comfortable eating, but then you forego the fresh-out-of-the-oven taste. You have to wait for the pizza... but it's worth it.

1279,Albert A.,0.0,5,"Quite frankly, the best pizza I have ever had. Wait is long, but this place is worth the visit. If they gave Michelin stars to pizza joints, this would be one of those ""worth a special trip"" places. I no longer live in New York, but I will carry this experience with me forever. A one and a half hour wait is a small price to pay. Dom makes each one himself, the ordering system is a bit chaotic, but while you wait, you get to observe a master at work. The man reaches into the scorching hot 900 degree oven and pulls out the pies with his bare hands. The best part is when he pulls out a bundle of basil and a pair of scissors and tiny bits of green leaves rain down onto the pie. I think the real game changer here is the Buffalo Mozzarella. I personally prefer the traditional margherita, but the baby artichokes are also a nice topping (the son sautés these).   As for the price, I think it is quite cheap for what you get. I live in Switzerland now, and a slice of pizza costs $10 (you read that right) in the school mensa.

I don't mind waiting especially for quality food, but it's ridiculous to be flat out lied to. In addition to waiting over 50 minutes for a slice of pizza, there was a family that walked in and ordered a whole pie 5 minutes after me and they got their pie before my slice was even ready.   And I know this isn't an isolated incident, because everyone that walked in after me was told their slice or whole pie would be ready in ""10 minutes"" and everyone ended up waiting just as long as me. And then the lady taking orders can't understand why people were getting so upset waiting. I think she's so worried about losing customers if she tells them it's an hour wait, however she's losing far more customers by lying to them.

I just couldn't believe the wait and I came back a few times.The person at the cashier was fair. The last time I went back to check I stood there and waited. Since I was back and the people on line in front of me wasn't, he asked the chef to make my pizza first. When I got my pizza, I ate a slice in the car and I couldn't stop eating it. It was so delicious and worth the wait. The only thing I regret about going there is that I will never feel the same when I bite into any other pizza slices because this place was just THAT GOOD.

The sauce is delicious--a rounded balance of sweet & acid, and you can taste a hint of black pepper.  All imported San Marzanos.  The cheese is imported mozzarella di bufala, all creamy and with a perfect melt.  Every pie gets hit with olive oil and basil, a dusting of grana padano, to perfection, and you can taste all the flavors come together.  And the crust--it's thin under the toppings, as expected, with a good char on the bottom, around the ends you get a nice puffy chew contrasting on top of the char.  Pretty much a perfect NY-style, Neapolitan crust.  The crust is ideal to swab up the olive oil that may run off the slice and off your hand (not cheese grease like at a crappy neighborhood joint--olive oil).  The oven's not fired with coal or wood, but it stays very hot nonetheless to get the crust perfect.  Well worth the wait.",6/20/2016,0,6,0,JxSq0fUpXRZNWjvXHJzyrw

Well, I have had the $1 slices, the Lombardi's, Grimaldi's in Las Vegas, oh and I have lived in Italy so I like to think that i have tasted it all. Boy was I wrong! My friend's boyfriend, who proved himself to be quite the foodie, recommended stopping here on the way to Coney Island and I am so glad that he did. The place is tiny and it's $4 a slice, but so worth it. We each grabbed a plain margarita style slice, sauce, cheese, and basil. I would classify this pizza as a perfect fusion of true Italian pizza and NY style pizza. It is cheesy like NY pizza with the simple clean flavor of Italian pizza. It was pure perfection! We bought the rest of the pizza that they had prepared but were there long enough to watch a brand new pizza emerge from the oven. We pounced on it and found that it was even better than the first piece. We discovered new flavors, the sauce - oh the sauce - simple delicious unadulterated tomato flavor. This pizza is perfect.Most importantly, I learned a lesson at Di Fara pizza. The term pizza is too darn broad! It covers NY style, Lombardi's coal oven pizza, Chicago deep dish, true Italian pizza, and now Di Fara's pizza. We really need a new word for each different type of pizza!

1293,Ron W.,1.0,5,"I consider myself to be a bit of a pizzaholic so Di Fara's has been on my ToDo list for years!  We got in line fifteen minutes before opening, a handful of pizza afficionados in front and back of us.  As the door opened, we shuffled inside, got our order in for a meatball pie and waited patiently on a shared table.  There was a bit of reverence in the air as Dominic worked his magic!  Moving in a measured, efficient fashion, he knocks out pies with the ease of a seasoned pizzaiolo.  A few lucky people got their slices early but we needed to wait for our custom order pizza.  In about 30 minutes, our name was called and my cousin trotted triumphantly back with our beautiful pie!  A bit burnt on one side, swimming with cheese and a bit of olive oil, the pie had a smattering of hand-cut basil and was baked to perfection.  I waited a bit for it to cool down which was pure torture!  The first bite was magical, you can taste the three cheeses that are used and the fresh basil on top.  The crust cracks a bit but holds its own with some chewiness, light and delicious.  The sauce pops out with bright, tomato flavor and the meatball was perfectly spiced.  Definitely some first-class, fresh ingredients here, you have to appreciate the details of a master at work.    Take em all together and you know you're eating a pie that is uniquely special and made with love.   What can I say, it was great pizza but hard to compare it to anything else since I haven't had anything else like it.  Better than Pepe's?  Hmmm.  Better than Totonnos and Lombardi's?  Probably.  Best pizza ever?!  Wow, that's a tough one but just maybe...  The only way I can find out is by sampling all the other great pies out there, in the US and Italy.  And that's a goal that I'll happily take on.  But for now, DiFara's is certainly at the top of the pizza pantheon for me!Update 12/19/09: Just went to Pepe's in New Haven last week and what can I say but Di Fara is still the pie to beat...",9/25/2009,812,975,6072,lquc6IF6uGIeRomDLu9UnA

1297,Jenny L.,0.0,3,"It was perfectly fine pizza, but I'm not sure about the hype. I think it's endearing that the owner still makes the pizza and cuts basil on to the fresh pies himself. And it might be blasphemous for me to say this, but I liken the pies to Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. Slightly soppy pizza  due to the toppings (maybe it was our bad to get the pie with toppings vs just plain cheese). Would I wait the 2 hours again? Definitely not. Would I eat it if it was presented in front of me? Definitely. Save yourself the wait. Mooch of someone else who did the waiting for you.Disclaimer: I am not a pizza connoisseur. Pizza comes in three categories to me - crispy and delicious, or soggy and nice, or chewy and meh. This pizza was soggy and nice.",4/5/2014,157,79,2,gQ594ynw55Sb_aq3gwWgsA

1299,Mary V.,0.0,5,"Even though Di Fara's is overly saturated with rave reviews, I must add my two cents on this place. I LOVE DI FARA! Definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Although it is NOT convenient in any way, it is totally worth all the inconveniences for a real NYC pizza experience!Di Fara is located in an unsuspecting part of Brooklyn (Avenue J between E 14th and E 15th St.) and there are no ""cool"" areas to hang out in the area. The restaurant is small, with seating for about 15 people, so consider yourself lucky if you get a table. There is ALWAYS a wait so be prepared! Last time I was here we waited over an hour for our pie, so make sure you come with a fully charged phone! :)The absolute best part about Di Fara is Dom DeMarco, the owner/old man that makes all the pizza. He scoots around the kitchen, individually preparing each pizza with his flour covered apron and hands. He is a true Brooklyn legend!When it comes to the pizza itself, I recommend the Square Pie. The crust is thick, crispy, and a tad charred (the corner slices are the best!). The pizza is very flavorful, with fresh, high quality ingredients. Dom is very generous with the olive oil and fresh basil on top. He cuts the fresh basil with scissors, which I find so cute for some strange reason. The Square pie is baked 2-3 times, so expect a longer than normal wait time if you decide to order one. In fact, Di Fara's is SO good that a guy once offered me $15 for a slice! (I didn't accept his offer but I did give him a slice!)",9/6/2013,215,7,27,YmwkqE6p58egXAG8xwoJXQ

It obviously makes everything taste better.  These difaras know what they're doing. They do only make a couple pies at once, so it's best to decide how many slices you want up front as opposed to ordering one slice then deciding later you want another one.I've been lucky to go during off peak hours, so I haven't experienced this crazy wait time that everyone is talking about. I'd probably be mad too.  I hate waiting for things. This is the generation of instant gratification. But just wait  for this pizza, guys. It's worth it.

Grandma's/Sicilian/Square pizza & the Margherita/round pie are the only two choices available. Do yourself & everyone waiting for their pizza a humongous favor.

It isn't even mediocre, it's terrible.Then one day I passed by the store and looked inside. As soon as I saw this man cooking I understood everything. There is something truly unique about watching him cook. With the way he shreds the cheese, cuts the basil with scissors, etc, he really looks like an artist at work. It's fascinating to watch, so a lot of people enjoy watching him cook. I understand that. But those who like watching him cook delude themselves into thinking the pizza tastes decent.

1306,Shannon L.,1.0,5,"Oh I love Di Fara's.  And I know the pies aren't 100% perfect.  You've probably read and seen that sometimes the crust can come out burnt.  But the TLC that goes into creating each pie and the freshness/seasonings of the ingredients is something to crave.Everybody loves Grimaldi's but I've been there twice and felt that the pepperonis were tasty but they had to carry the weight of most of the moderately bland pizza.  Now Di Fara's doesn't have as nice of a seating area.  In fact, some of the tables are wobbly and the smoke made my eyes tear up to the point that I just had to stand outside by myself.  It's a bustling area so you need not be afraid.You all know by now that only 1 adorable man makes the pizza and one at a time.  On a Thursday night, there were only 5-6 orders ahead of mine but I waited a good 40 minutes for the Di Fara Special Pie ($32).  This has as lot of stuff on it and can make your slice floppy at times so I'd go with something simple to start off with.  He'll top every pie with fresh basil no matter what.And another small detail: I like that they don't overcharge people for sodas.  You can get 3 drinks for $2.  They close at 9pm but if you've already ordered, they'll let you eat there until after closing.",9/20/2011,1413,2774,3483,NeXRy1C7PxS7bvIcQ3SymA

I want to talk about the youngish guy with a faux-hawk who lives above Di Fara's kind of to the right and above the green awning with the window open. So like, my friends were saving this spot for me to park in front of Di Fara's, and this woman tried to back in as I was pulling in, got supa-mad, threatened to hit my friend with her car, did hit my friend with her car, gesticulated wildly, screamed a lot, and then called the cops.  This all happened within 2 minutes while I stared from the driver's seat. She kept saying she wanted her Dunkin Donuts or something, so maybe she was on some kind of drugs because anyone who is going through so much trouble to get Dunkin Donuts is going through some issues I don't understand.  Anyhow, THEN, Mr. Faux-hawk upstairs starts yelling at my friends from his window and hyping the other lady, so now they're just shouting to each other so the whole damn street is staring (including the Hasidic/ conservative children).  Then my other friend was taking out her phone, and he starts screaming that it's against the law to take pictures of other people's cars (not true) and like sprints downstairs into the street with his wife beater and landline yelling that he was trying to call the cops.  WHAT? At this point, I'm like this noise is too ratchet, let's all get in this car and park a block down. Windows up, doors locked.Even though we were worried that the tiny crowd of onlookers in front of Di Fara's would come after us like angry villagers Beauty and the Beast style, we went anyways and got that pizza and it' was definitely WORTH IT. I guess the condensed version of this review is:1. Eating Di Fara's pizza is worth a physical altercation to get to2.

1318,Tony J.,1.0,4,"Definitely one of the best pizzerias in New York. Their pizza is quite different from what you get at Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. Di Fara has a bit less tomato sauce, and the mozzarella cheese is not quite as good as Grimaldi's. But Dom really likes to go crazy with the olive oil and basil, which I enjoy a lot. The best way I would describe the difference is that Grimaldi's and Lombardi's are more hearty while Di Fara has a more sharp, flavorful taste. The way the flavors come together is better than any other pizza place I have ever been to.Some might balk at the prices. The price for a regular pie is $28, but remember that tax is included and no tip is expected (you pick up your pizza at a counter). So it's really more like $22 on a menu. I got a classic pie (sausage, mushrooms, onions, peppers) for $32, or $25 equivalent. Grimaldi's and Lombardi's large pizzas with four toppings would be $22 ($14 + $2 per topping) and $32.50 ($20.50 + $3 per topping), so the price isn't actually that bad.I would normally give this 4.5 stars, but I'm knocking off half a star for deficiencies in communication. In this day and age, everything is increasingly electronic, but sometimes you want a specific question answered in real time, so it is helpful for a business to have a working phone. Unfortunately, if you call them, there is a very good chance they will not pick up the phone. Their email address, info@difara.com, also does not work. I wanted to find out what day they were least busy, when was the latest I could show up and still be served, etc. In the end, at 6:30 PM on Wednesday I decided to make the 45-minute excursion from Manhattan to Brooklyn without any knowledge of whether I'd make it on time. Of course, when I got there, I got all the answers to my questions. For your benefit, I am sharing it here, because there is pretty much no other way for you to find out:1. The lady who works there on Wednesdays always tries to pick up the phone. She also works on some Fridays. If they do pick up the phone, you can place a phone order ahead of time to save some of the wait.2. The listed 8:30 PM closing time is the last time they will accept an order. So they might stay open until 10 PM (or whenever they finish making the pies) if necessary. However, there is a possibility they could run out of dough, so placing orders before 8 PM is recommended.3. There is essentially no line for ordering, though this is only reflective of this particular Wednesday night at 7:15 PM; your experiences may differ. You go up to the counter, place your order, and she writes it down on a legal pad.4. The main waiting time is for your pizza. During this time, you are free to wander around the area (and visit all the kosher shops), because your place in line is held on the pad. What I've noticed is that almost everyone is quoted a 20-minute wait time (including me), but it took about 90 minutes for my pizza to come out.",8/23/2013,131,465,49,0oD7hL4ie7_cwB9gWn8AVA

If you're not amongst the first and you have to wait on the chaotic line (if you even want to call it that), it could be a while before you get your delicious pizza.Here's how you know Di Fara is legit: There's just one old Italian man making the pizza and he uses a rusty old oil can to pour the olive oil on and uses a dirty scissor to cut the fresh basil onto the pizza. It's also legit because this place has been shut down numerous times for health code violations, even before the city really cracked down and started that whole letter grade system.

1328,Michael L.,0.0,3,"I just don't get it.Yeah, the slice was really good.  Crust was crisp on the outside, and doughy on the inside, sauce was pretty tasty and the cheese was fresh.BUT, a 1 hour trip to Midwood gives you PLENTY of time to think about what the perfect slice of pizza should taste like, and I just didn't get that at Di Fara's.  If anything, my biggest takeaways for both slices (1 square, 1 plain) were that they were doused in too much oil, meager on sauce, and visually smaller than almost any slice you'll get in New York.And as is well documented on Yelp, they have the balls to charge $5 for the slice.It's awesome to see the original dude still making pies, but for a pizza mecca they need much more than a nostalgic moment to win me over.  They also have not put a penny into their store in decades.  I like the homemade feel of a pizza joint (which at its best feels like a familiar hangout), but this is really just a dining area in decay. SUPER BONUS:  Go across the street to the jewish bakery.  They make UNREAL rugelach (small usually-chocolate pastries).",7/16/2013,82,145,2,tr38posFQzF82HqCRgy6Cw

The pizza was so good, the cheese melts on your mouth and the flavors hit the spot. the wait was so worth it.4 stars: there was no bathroom and i needed to use it badly.Overall this is the best pizza place i ever been too.

1338,Andrew L.,1.0,5,"Pizza made the same way for decades... that's what you get here, one guy, he makes all the pizzas... every single one, is made by his hands.  Simple is what makes this pie great, crust, sauce, cheese, (toppings if you must), and into the oven.  This is the machined precision that you might expect from a chain, but it's the perfection that your pie is literally nothing like the one made before it, other than the taste. Look, a good pizza is one that has a little bit of soul, and heart.  Standing outside in line for 45 minutes, ordering, then waiting 2 hours for my order, means you know you are getting the standard in NYC pizza, and that you are getting love and care in the pie you are getting.  The crust is hard, chewy and crunchy, the sauce and cheese combination is perfection, with chunks of cheese, melted, like islands of milky excellence, in a sea of tomato.  Every pizza is topped with (and I think this is the best part) fresh basil, and olive oil.  It's like the cherry on the top of what is considered the ""cream de la cream"" of pizzas. I love a good pizza; moreover, I love good food.  I travel the US, and along the way, I eat my way through a city; Brooklyn has so many flavors, but when it comes down to it; this guy makes a slice of pizza worth waiting for, he knows it, and I'm sure the line of people waiting outside, knows that too.  Dress warm, and make friends with the person next to you in line, because you are going to have many conversations to kill the time, while you are waiting of a slice of goodness.",1/23/2016,1392,533,524,ZPoxivgZ9mnZQZiuYmFgjw

Really?  Never tried it huh?  A shame, Its da best. No question. Da best""This is a direct quote from my friend's parents who have lived out in Marine Park for three generations.  They were teenagers when they first went to Di Fara in the jivin sixties and seventies now their children have grown up eating it to the synth sounds of the 80s and 90s moved away (to three different states) yet they all come back to Brooklyn and when they do they have to get their Di Fara on.  Ever since hearing about this neighborhood legend and being shown first hand why he is so infamous, I have been obsessed with Di Fara.  That was seven years ago. How I play it:  Walk in the door and notice a really odd lack of line/clusterduck backing you right up to the door.  Do not be alarmed.  My ocd tendencies immediately wanted to ask everyone where their place in line was.   The best you are going to get is keeping an eye on the person in front of you and trailing them the whole time.  Your mission:  get to the counter and get on the younger De Marco's yellow legal pad.  This takes roughly 30-40 mins.  Once you are on it you can walk out of the store.  Thats right, I said it.  Get out of there.  Its too crowded and now you can go buy a 40 from CVS with your friends.  Sit back, relax and enjoy your day (choose a nice sunny day).  Check in routinely on your pie status.  Its going to take 20 mins most likely.  When you are up for your pie delight in the joy that is the legendary Dom grabbing your pizza out of the oven (sometimes with his bare hands) and then lovingly fresh grating mozzarella and snowing it over your pie.  But wait theres more!  He then makes it rain an entire herb garden full of fresh basil he snips per order all over the pie with me out loud cheering him on MORE MORE - he laughs - topping it off with a mini oil can of heavenly Napolitano mediterranean olive oil.  Watching this part most everyone shakes their head as in, 'this is not going to be good for me', but then...all is forgotten about health concerns when the joyous pizza is being eaten.  MMmmmmhhhmmm.              ===============================================                                                Food Coma intermission                   (me passed out on the sidewalk outside - or on the Q train)              ===============================================Its not so close to me in Manhattan but well worth a seasonal trek.  Its amazing there is no question about it, this pizza is insane.  However you want to keep it a special thing and at the price point and distance from my house it will always be a destination foodie adventure, not an all the time thing.",4/19/2011,558,213,311,YufI05DgqvOVwNgCvs0Big
1341,Ronald C.,0.0,5,"Located in an unassuming Midwood store front, Di Fara deserves its legendary reputation for serving the best NYC-style pie in the boroughs.  The crust is perfectly crisp, yet chewy--defying the laws of pizza physics--with sauce that has just the right combination of tang and savoriness.  Topped simply with mozzarella and freshly-cut basil is the way to go--this pizza's inherent perfection doesn't require additional toppings, unless you must.  If you are looking for first-date aesthetics, you may prefer the romantic Lucali in Carroll Gardens over Di Fara's spartan slice-shop accoutrement, but if your focus is the food, you won't be disappointed.  Don't go hungry though, the wait is at least an hour for a pie.",1/8/2016,8,67,19,FSQ80uyyN4LuaJjd1gssAw

1343,Jin Y.,0.0,4,I've heard a lot about this place and decided to make a trip here one Wednesday evening. We arrived a little before 7 PM and surprisingly there was no wait at all. We ordered the regular pie and it took about 20 minutes to be ready. It's a medium size pizza that 2-3 people can finish and the most expensive pizza at $28 a pie that I've had without any toppings. The pizza is finished with olive oil and fresh basil. It's definitely one of the best slices I've had but I don't think I would make the trip out again. A lot pizza joints in NYC make comparable quality pizza for half the price. The place is very old and has a few tables to eat in.

There's also no where in the neighborhood to really wait around unless you live out here. Anyway, this was stop number 2 of our pizza crawl on Saturday! I didn't make it to the final stop number 3. But alas, I hate Lucali anyway. I like that all of the ingredients are fresh and its so old school and neat. But then there is this extra sloppy coating of olive oil that they pour on top at the end. Definitely, it's still up there in quality as one of the best slices I've had out here but I can't quite put my finger on why it just can't get 5 stars. Also, I can't justify spending $5 on a slice. I put in $6 because my friends wanted to eat more. Whatever. But waiting around in Dunkin Donuts and in the hot humid sticky weather for a $5 slice of grease just was not my thing. Maybe if it were normal priced I'd value it a little more. Eh. Go to Toby's or Spumoni Gardens and get your money and 2 hours of your life back.

I live out in Flushing, Queens and going all the way to Midwood, Brooklyn was quite the drive but we had errands around there anyway. First impression, I love the oldschool feel to the outside. You don't see that anymore and as soon as you walk in, you'll see the dark green paint and all the articles and magazine covers and credentials DiFara's pizza were ever in.It wasn't too busy like I anticipated and honestly, I wanted to share this experience with my brother and mom. So, I placed my order and gave the assistant my name since I wanted the DiFara Classic Pie (which btw is a whopping $32 for a 8-slice pie. go hard or go home right?) He told us it would be a 1-hour wait which we were willing to do. So, we stepped out for about 40 minutes. Came back and I asked how much longer and was told 5 minutes. It turned out he ended up giving our pie to the people who ordered right after us, thinking we were together (he happened to be asian as well and I'm filipino). So, I was then informed 15 more minutes. Okay no biggie, I'm assuming the next pie will be ours. nope. neither was the next or the one after or the 8 pies after. waited an extra half an hour after pie after pie passed me. This was so frustrating and HEARTBREAKING. I would understand that maybe we should have waited in the pizzeria but people were ordering pies and stepping out as well. What made our order any different??I did not want to go down this route but this is what I got out of it. I felt like because we were a different race, we were treated differently. mind you, I refuse to mention situations like this but its only right because my mother was offended by the patrons eating there as well. A group of Caucasian males looked at us and complained loudly about the ""different kind of people coming here."" this is absurd and you're in NY, buddy. I also felt DeMarco and his assistant were constantly postponing our order. We finally got our pie after that long wait. it was burnt. horribly burnt on the crusts. I've enjoyed brick-oven before but it was a flimsy dough and putting that handful of parm was salty and not impressive. the fresh basil, maybe. nothing about this pie impressed me. Remember I mentioned I saw the same kinds of pizza pie passed me? yeah, I think I'm able to tell the difference if DeMarco cared for our pie like he did others.Sorry, they lost a potentially good yelp review. and this is probably my longest. its a shame they have to run their business this way. Well, I always have had Gaby's Pizza on Hillside. Want superceded flavor AND service? get Gaby's in Queens Village.

We got there early, right around opening time so we could grab a table and drink our wine/beers while the pizza was made by O.G. Dom Demarco. Make sure you do this, as it can take upwards of 1.5 hours for your pizza to come up. If you follow that advice you'll have a better time. The pizza was, as expected, very delicious. We got the classic, which comes with cheese, peppers, maybe mushrooms, and is finished with freshly snipped basil. Overall I enjoyed the pie, but I could use less charring on the crust. I think when I go back (which I definitely will) I'll get the sicilian. Apparently they put a little oil underneath the dough as it cooks in the cast-iron, subsequently frying the bottom a bit. It looked orgasmic. The couple next to us was eating it and they were in heaven. They literally looked utterly stoned from the good greasiness of it.

Since we live just a couple blocks away, we could take a quick trip to get a few great slices or pies. I say 'HAD' because as his prices have gone way up, his consistency has gone way down. When Dom is on, his is the best pizza I've ever had. But in the last few years we've gone a few times, and each time he either forgot ingredients or let the pies cook too long and burn. So we just don't bother anymore. The divey interior and long waits and high prices might be worth it if the pie were reliably great. But since it's not, who wants to drop e.g. $60 for a couple pies for a birthday only to have them come out...ugh.An FYI for anyone still interested in taking a chance. We've noticed that unlike the food from a lot of more ""generic"" pizza joints, Dom's doesn't do well after it's been out for a while (and forget about cold pizza for breakfast the next morning!). Maybe it's the flip side of the fact that his ingredients are fresh and high quality (a lot of them imported).

They top it with fresh basil, which just makes it that much more wonderful. I can easily easy a whole pie, it's so delicious. I love how the owner pretty much makes all the pies right in front of you, and takes his time doing it. It's sweet and old fashioned, and I love it. That being said, if you're in a rush, maybe skip this one because the wait is pretty long (less so during the winter months), or just order one slice.

While I had high expectations, I was pretty confident that it would fall short since I heard such great reviews. We arrived a little after they opened and we were able to find seats for the 5 of us. We ordered the plain and the one with meats (I forgot what it's called). Yes, the plain gets finished with fresh basil and olive oil. However, it was the perfect combination. The meat pie was delicious as well. Extremely flavorful! Being a New Yorker, I didn't think pizza could ever taste like this. I loved it so much, I tried coming here with my cousins.

1400,Jennifer C.,1.0,3,"At first glance, this pizzeria is unassuming and without any flashy signs of excellence.  The storefront is unflinchingly dingy that you'd walk right by without even realizing that Di Fara's has consistently been dubbed a ""pizza heaven"" for years on-end by various food mags, and that Yelpers adore this place.  Now, I don't mind dingy; if a place can churn out spectacular food while appearing completely unassuming, that's the golden ticket, I go bonkers for that sort of thing.  But DiFara's, for all it's supposed modesty, is actually slightly pretentious.3.5 stars.These are my gripes:1)  The atmosphere feels like a post-apocalyptic doomsday scenario, Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" style.  I mean, people are trying their hardest to elbow their way to a table and vie for seats that are scare in supply and ridiculous in demand.  Case in point:We saw a pregnant woman rubbing her belly in discomfort as she stood there looking into the faces of the many seated diners who didn't care about her or her unborn child.  Yes, she may have voluntarily placed herself in that position because she wanted DiFara's pizza and nothing else would suffice, but common courtesy should look past that and someone should have given up a seat for her.  It was nice that my boyfriend eventually got up to give her some relief until a table opened up to her and her bun, and hubby.  This is not the type of mood I want to be in while enjoying a pizza.  The weight of all the pairs of eyes looking upon you as you eat, almost burns a hole into your body.  It seems people are mentally counting the slices of pizza you have on your plate until you are done and ready to go, so that they can strategize the best way to nab your free table.  We did the same.  It places pressure on you to rush through your meal so others can sit.  Stressful.  It only took 3 seconds before some lady scooped up my chair as I got up to leave.  No matter how tasty that pizza, how great the crust,  this left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Here was great pizza being marred by a hostile environment. *2) It's expensive.  Maybe these ingredients are rare, pure, organic, virginal, local, or perhaps imported from Italy, but $5.00 for a slice makes one's head scratch.  I've never seen such high prices for pizza.  We decided to get a plain cheese pie, with olives on one half of the pie.  This was a whopping $29!  I'm wondering what the profit margin looks like here.  It amused me that as we left, they posted a sign on the door that said they were out of dough.  I had to say to myself, ""I get it, they mean pizza dough, and not dough as in the casual, slang way of saying money, because that, they are certainly rolling in.""  3) The wait time is a good one hour and some change.  The fact that it was my first go at DiFara's helped my patience level because it gave me the opportunity to observe the way the world works in DiFara's universe.  The flow of people, the vying for tables, the making of great pizza, the taking down of orders on a, yellow legal-sized pad.. this was all entertaining to watch.  But at the 45-minute mark, I started to get hungry, and I was also sad for the pregnant woman, that my amusement slowly turned to annoyance.  If you sit there for an hour, eating your pizza, savoring each slice and enjoying the company you are with, that is understandable, but if you have to kill an hour just standing around and waiting for your pizza before you can even eat it, it's really not an ideal situation.  Maybe we went during an extremely busy time (Sunday, early afternoon), but then again, for all the hype driving this business, I don't think there's ever any quiet time.  The pizza chef mastermind, Dominic, looks like a very sweet man.  He works diligently and in quiet confidence like a man that knows his trade inside-and-out.  It's a glorious process of pizza craftsmanship to witness his expert hands form a gorgeous pizza.  He is due this praise.  But maybe someone should implore him to pay a little attention to the swarms of customers that would like to eat in some peace and comfort.  Maybe, wipe down those grease-stained beer pong picnic tables every once in a while?  Perhaps ask the patrons to respect each other and not mimic the dealings of a vulture the second a table becomes available.  Without question DiFara's pizza is fantastic, but fantastic can be had elsewhere without such stress.  (Paule Gee's is my fave!)__* Hostile except for the few kind souls that told us we didn't have to get anything fancy as our first time.. that a plain cheese pizza would prove their greatness.  Also, the nice lady that offered use some rugala from the bakery across the street as we waited in line for our pie.",2/2/2011,560,647,1351,fX2eLAYd9ufkCrBJdZF3Ag

1403,Keith R.,0.0,5,"Pizza is almost always my last choice for lunch or dinner. Nevertheless, at the insistence of my wife, I went to experience what many have called the best neapolitan-style pizza on earth. High expectations lead to disappointment, right?I won't say that light shined down from Heaven on the slice I purchased, but I confess that it is the best pizza I've ever eaten. Not so much the cheese or the sauce or even the fresh basil (though these are obviously of the highest quality) but because of the crust.Oh, that crust. It has not left my mind. I do not know when it will leave my mind. Needless to say, as effortlessly as Mr. DeMarco creates such a succulent crust, I have to wonder: is he a genius, or is the rest of the pizza world just not getting it?Built into the pizza's value is the charm of Mr. DeMarco himself and his store. Yes, this is a real Italian immigrant working alone at his labor of love---slowly, carefully, and before everyone's eyes in a humble corner shop. He's spent fifty years perfecting his craft. Even the temperature of the water he uses in the dough depends on the weather.I have heard stories of two-hour lines. Our wait was twenty minutes on a Friday afternoon, a little past one o'clock. Admittedly, if I returned I'd try this same time again because my desire for pizza will probably never reach such pilgrimage status that a two hour wait is worth it.Despite the small crowd, the unaccomodating size of Di Fara Pizza meant that the tables were still filled, causing my wife and I to wander the neigborhood in search of a place to set our pizza on.

1406,SK V.,0.0,2,"The pizza would be excellent if there weren't so many things working against them:1) The restaurant has been closed multiple times by the health department, and you can tell by looking at it why.  The man makes money from the adoring throngs who wait for pizza, although it's true, not as much as he would if he baked more than one pie at a time (not sure if that's right or just how it feels).  Anyway, he's not broke, and I believe they should be able to at least make it LOOK like rats don't have the run of the place as soon as he closes the door behind the last customer.  I've been here multiple times and have lived around here for 23 years, so I'm not just being a tourist icked-out by the place.  2) The adoring throngs.  Yes, most people are nice, that's true, but over the years this place has become more about the ""experience"" of waiting and the hipster cool factor than about serving customers.  One of my closest friends grew up just around the corner from DiFara and used to get pizza there all the time as a young person.  Dom knows her from the neighborhood.  She's polite, patient, and sweet.  But she's said the wait has become interminable as it's become a complete tourist destination, and the last time she was there, after waiting on line like everyone else for more than two hours, he gave her pie away to some well-dressed tourist that was standing beside her.  She objected and complained, but he brushed her off and gave her a rude answer.  So she's never gone back.  3) The pizza is not touched by Jesus.  It's really good, but it's not *that* much better than other places like Totonno's in Coney Island, or even Grimaldi's if you get a good one.  Once you get to that level and that style of pizza, unless you're a well trained connoisseur, you're probably not going to notice much difference at all EXCEPT THAT YOU WAITED THREE HOURS (evening), standing up, in a locked restaurant (because they lock the doors early to prevent MORE customers from coming in), and the old man pulled your pie out of the oven bare-handed.   Okay, and he hand-clipped basil.

So with no breakfast in our stomachs, we hopped on the train, got off at exactly two minutes to 12, and were the first in line as they were opening up. Let me say this. I think we were both in shock at how smoothly it all went down. We had imagined lines, waiting, possibly some pushing. At least contemplating getting a snack while we had to wait. Some sort of Di Fara drama. But instead we felt like the luckiest people on the planet as we placed our order, and sat down at one of the large tables. The pizza itself was pretty freakin awesome. Definitely felt like we went to Italy for the afternoon instead of Ave J. By far the best pizza I have had on this continent. We got a few slices and then had to get a few more, of course. Sheer perfection. The crust (A+) the sauce (A+) and the cheese (A+) really were all out of this world. My favorite non pizza part was definitely the yellow notepad. Simply put- amazing:)",3/3/2014,25,114,1,tn58ieiiIvFES7Pzxoy5pQ

1413,Melissa W.,0.0,3,"This is a tough review to write. I'd give it somewhere between a 3 and a 4. But before you pounce, let me explain myself. Sure, it's a nice experience to go and witness a Brooklyn legend execute his art in his quaint, rundown pizza shop. It's worth making the pilgrimage once to experience the tradition of waiting in line and salivating over everyone else's pizzas while your stomach slowly eats itself. We got there about 10 minutes before noon (opening time) on a Saturday, and there was already quite a line outside. We'd read that there are often 45 minute waits, but we figured it wouldn't be terrible as there were maybe 10-15 people ahead of us in line. And when we ordered about 10 minutes after 12 and the guy at the counter told us it would be about 20 minutes, we thought we'd lucked out. Little did we know, a 20 minute wait really means a 90 minute wait. So wait we did, drooling and starving while all the pizzas that were ordered before ours (VERY) slowly came out. And 90 minutes later, our pizza was ready. The two of us wolfed down the entire pie, with its thin and slightly crispy, slightly burnt crust, burn-your-mouth hot cheese (if you don't burn your mouth, you are not consuming your pizza properly), tangy tomato-ridden sauce, and fresh basil. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was definitely really good. But was it the best pizza I ever had? I'm not sure. If it was, it wasn't the best by a wide margin. And $30 for a pie/$5 a slice? I dunno, I've had great pizzas for half the price, and the difference in good-ness is negligible and certainly not double. So is it worth going once for the experience? If you have plenty of time to kill and your wallet is feeling a bit too heavy, absolutely. Is it worth it otherwise? The wait combined with the price (not to mention the random location and extremely limited hours) make me unlikely to keep coming back.",9/18/2015Previous review,219,375,7,DJp-RvWsIyX9z-8SN2N7Ag

Nothing. If you took the atmosphere of this place and put it in every restaurant in NYC, there wouldn't be so many openings and closings every day. Di Fara's just gets it, from the fresh basil in the window to the old half-broken tables. The smell of cheese in the air, fresh Parmesan, to the old Italian man making it, you can't teach that. I will guarantee you that I will never have better pizza, and I will make it a point to return here each time I come back to Brooklyn. Where else can you wait thirty minutes for a slice when no one else is waiting and not care the slightest bit? It's all worth it in the end.",12/15/2015Updated review,0,7,0,w4CIFemC3h9CFb4-lYFqiw

I first came here about 5 years ago and remember eating so much that I could barely move. I've been back a handful of times since and it's always the same: unbelievably delicious. Terrific dough/crust, melty, slightly burned cheese, fresh cut basil, and a generous drenching of olive oil - what's not to like? Both the regular and square pies are great, although I slightly prefer the square because I think it holds up a little better and provides a nice crunchy texture. It's also very cool to watch the guy make the pizzas, especially once you realize he's been the only one doing it for almost 50 years. Tips: get here early, before they open to ensure that your order gets placed in the first ""wave."" Otherwise you'll be waiting a very long time. I've also heard that the man in charge sometimes will not open the shop if the dough doesn't meet his personal standards. That's never happened when I've gone, but might be worth considering before making the trek.",1/2/2016,3,6,0,5-rcObhvXva2ZvdfPe50AA
1420,Ginger P.,0.0,4,"There are a lot of good pizzas in NYC -- John's, Lombardi's, Grimaldi's -- and Di Fara is as good. I pass it three times a week going to physical therapy early in the evening. I decided to try it, because we were having caesar salad for dinner. Of course, when I decide to try it there's a line. They had the front door roped off and a sign said only the take-out window would be open until 6. It was 6:30 when they took the rope down. Then a lot of big-bellied men in Mets shirts filed out after posing for pictures with the owners. A younger guy on the sidewalk explained NYC pizza to two girls who must have been visiting the city for the first time from the moon. The woman in the window finally took my order.She didn't heat the pizza up. It had just been sitting on a tray, and she put it in a box, and I paid. The earth didn't move for me when I ate it, but it was good. They don't need any more hype, though, so I'll say the crust is the same as Two Boots. The cheese was good and did manage to thinly cover the slice with its fresh basil and tomato. I would recommend it, but you'll live if you never try it.",8/14/2013,238,299,253,WEoKFyAYFaaVrRRoXcALoA

1423,James M.,0.0,3,"You are DEFINITELY waiting 2 hours. I am stating the obvious here, but yeah, YOU ARE DEFINITELY WAITING 2 HOURS. I was the third person on line for the day, getting to the place at 11AM for a 1:30 opening time and still waited 2 hours and fifteen minutes. Only a few tables, and the place is tiny, so much of that time you will be waiting outside. The guy who makes the pizza is a sweet old guy who does everything by hand. I still haven't decided if that's part of the charm or if he is just trolling us. The pizza is very good. Solid crust from a old fashioned oven, perfect amount of sauce, and the Pecorino Romano is a great touch on the high quality mozz. What sets it apart is the tremendous toppings, which are among the best around. The garlic cherry tomatoes are an absolute must have, rivaled only for best NYC pizza topping by the handmade sausage at Louie and Ernie's. It's not perfect though, as everything is loaded with salt, with lots and lots of oil. No doubt DIFara makes a suburb pie, and its worth going too. Once. After that, its gets insane spending that much time waiting.  Again, the pizza is great, but in the same league as Patsy's and Grimaldis (original location).  You aren't waiting for 2 hours at either of those iconic joints. Bottom line, if you are a pizza geek like me, you have to try it. Sadly though, there's no way I can go back again. I mean, 2 hours for a slice of pizza? It brings to mind Soviet breadlines in the 1980's, where starving peasants would wait on line hours in the brutal Russian winter for a scrap of cooked dough. Replace  ""starving peasants"" with ""hipster bourgeois"", and put expensive cheese on the dough, and you have the idea.

It's hard to tell if the pizza really is ""the best in NY"" if you've been waiting 2.5 hours for it. We were starving by the time it emerged. So we may have overrated it initially as we inhaled it.I took two veggie slices home for Day 2. Still good pizza, quality ingredients, spices perfectly infused. But, there's not much sauce on it. It's nice that Difara and son run the place, but I wouldn't mind if there were extra hands and another oven.2. The price. $32 for a large and $5 for a cheese slice that isn't that big is too much in my view. 3. The experience. The location is in a gray, suburban area of Brooklyn. The restaurant is a small area with fluorescent lights, a few cafeteria tables and fold up chairs. If the place had a nice bar, cozy warm atmosphere, where the walls were lined with the great reviews and history, it would be so much better.Instead, we stood starving in a cold bright room drinking canned Sapporo from the convenience store, trying not to bump into hungry patrons waiting for a pizza like they might wait for a Visa...anxious, listening intently for their initials...The key--order, then leave.

1452,Peter S.,1.0,3,"OK, I'm going to have to diverge from my Yelp friend, Peter D. on this one.To be sure, Di Fara has a damned good pizza.  It's a contender for one of the best in Brooklyn, but for me, a) it doesn't win best pie in Brooklyn, b) I don't like eating there, and c) it's overpriced.Sure, it's a great pizza.  Yet it's over-hyped.  This is what Peter D. was getting at when he says  ""Don't go in thinking Dom is an infallible pizza god.""  Judging by some, you'd think that Dom eats dough, tomatoes, and cheese and poops out golden pizza emanating classical music, rainbows and doves.  No, I've been here perhaps 10 times and the pizzas are often burned.  The toppings are a bit skimpy (and sometimes missing).  The slice is FIVE BUCKS.  The wait times are unreasonably long.  Dom has a Jesus complex.  15 to 20 minutes for a slice?  That's often too oily?  No thanks.All that for (an admittedly great) pizza?  Meh.  The best is the enemy of the good, and I'd rather get a (much bigger) very good slice for less than half the price and less than half the wait time.  Why is it so popular?  I believe that part of the reason is the cult of personality surrounding Dom.If you've never been here, I would recommend going at least once so you can sample a great pizza (hopefully it won't be burned, too oily, or have missing toppings).  This is more than I can say of Grimaldi's (which I would recommend _not_ going to at all).  At least that's something.BTW, I would say that Totonno's in Coney Island has a superior pizza.  And while the owners of Totonno's are pricks, the price is reasonable, and the pizza is better.  Be prepared for long waits, though.I'd also say John's Pizzeria on Bleecker has a better pizza which is reasonably priced, has a reasonable wait time, is served by totally cool people, and has a much better atmosphere.",4/10/2011,313,360,412,Xc4EMKB8V6kc_dzc2cmwDA

Thankfully, no huge line on a gloomy sunday at 3:30pm, but our Di Fara Classic still took an agonizing hour and a half. Unfortunately, there was not much to explore in the area. We were cold and tired from a long drive from Boston. We waited patiently and watched as Mr Di Fara deligently and methodically prepared one pizza after another. We were comforted by the sights and smells of the baking and baked pizzas.  I wolfed down two slices of the pie. Delicious.A complex pizza with simple ingredients, perfectly executed.

1462,Paul C.,0.0,4,"there's something especially charming about these old establishments that are a throwback of old new york. Quick aside, if you really think about, I have these moments where I just sit in awe of the reality of the sheer number of great people that have walked these streets that we have walked - and even the ones who we never heard about - to me, it keeps me in a constant state of wonder.okay, so this leads me to di fara pizza. the same man making pizza for customers for decades. I just wonder how many people stepped through those doors over the years with a story to tell. Maybe they were regulars. Maybe they were the first customers to come before it became an absolute tourist trap for transients like me.... but no matter who you are, I think there is something magical about this place. an establishment where one man makes pizza the right way for his entire life day in and day out. In a city where change is the ethos of the day, sometimes its nice to have something consistent.It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had in NY, but it's right up there in the mix. the wait was about an hour - the only thing that sucks about this is that if you go on a saturday, the place is a ghost town, and there is literally nothing to do but go to the convenience store and god forbid, loiter with your friends.But you can tell the ingredients are fresh, and that there is something truly authentic in the craft and final product here. a quintessential nyc slice. just to clarify, when I say fresh, there is that extra ""it"" factor when it comes to the mixture of flavors that hit your taste buds and connect to those weird brain electrodes..... i should probably stop there - but the flavor of the basil, the salami that i like to imagine comes from the local butcher down the street who the old man has been friends with since childhood...ok i digress.Go here for the experience, for an authentic nyc slice, and a long ass wait ;) nyc baby!!!",8/6/2013,253,100,68,K-ohUfIiay9LYKzknKY0hg

1465,Mike K.,0.0,5,"Oh. My. God. Oh my god. Oh my god. Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygodohmygodohmygod. This is the best pizza I've eaten in my life. Today was my second time at Di Fara and it was every bit as delicious as I remembered it. When I talk about Di Fara and my eyes get really big, people ask me how I can get so excited about it. ""It's just pizza, right?"" Yes, and that's precisely what makes it so great.Unlike pizza shops like Artichoke and Co., which offer pies that are recognizable as pizza only in the aesthetic sense (not saying it's bad, just not traditional), and even Grimaldi's, whose fare is very much pizza but a little self-conscious with its strategic sauce placement, Di Fara serves up plain old pizza. If you don't believe me, look at the pictures. Do you see that pie? Outside of the fresh basil it's almost exactly like any regular pie, nothing fancy, no gimmicks. However, it's the most delicious pizza ever.I don't give out five stars lightly (this is my second, and as of right now I can only think of two other places that I'd award this rating), but Dom DeMarco has earned it through offering sublime perfection from top to bottom.Actually, let's do this bottom to top. The crust at Di Fara is wonderful on its own: thinner than normal but not too thin, foldable and not brittle, and it possesses just the right pinch of salt and that slightly oven-charred flavor that, since you will almost certainly be eating it straight out of the oven, irresistibly wafts toward your nostrils. It's so good that it's almost a crime to not finish it along with the rest of the pizza. If you have perpetrated this by mistake, I would strongly urge you to reconsider the error of your ways.Next up is one of my favorite food groups: sauce! The tomato sauce on this pizza is everything you could ever want and more; it's sweet and flavorful, has the right hit of acidity, and Dom manages to cover the pie with it pretty well. In addition, the sauce contains pieces of diced tomato, which add a really nice texture to the pizza - a touch that you don't see too often.Di Fara uses three different cheeses in its pies. These are thickly sliced slabs of buffala mozzarella, shredded regular mozzarella, and finely grated grana padano. When Dom assembles his pizza, you'll see him cover the sauce with the mozzarellas, but he holds off on dusting the pizza with the grana padano until after the pie is done baking. Grana padano is related to parmigiano reggiano and has a really good nutty flavor that helps make this pizza distinctive.For most pizzas the review would wrap up at this point, with the cheese, but Di Fara doesn't stop there. After Dom dusts the pie with the final cheese, he drizzles olive oil over the pie, then takes a bunch of fresh basil leaves and a pair of scissors and cuts the basil over the pizza (I think something on the order of almost half of the Yelp pictures show Dom performing this ritual). To sum up: you have a perfect crust, a delicious sauce that has pieces of tomato in it, three different cheese, one that has a little edge to it, and aromatic fresh basil all rolled into one pie. Di Fara also has the perfect proportions. With each bite you can savor all of these ingredients and no one of them overpowers another or gets lost in the mix. When you taste it you'll understand: this is what pizza is meant to be. It can be a little messy to eat with the threads of cheese stretching for over a foot as you extricate one slice from a pie or the pieces of tomato rolling down your chin and hands as you quickly use evasive maneuvers to avoid losing any part of heaven, so ready your napkins before you start.At $28 a pie you could certainly go cheaper, but without a shadow of a doubt you'll also go lower quality. Half a pie is usually more than enough food, so $14 a person isn't too bad, especially when it's the best pizza ever. When you consider that each slice costs $5, the pie - 8 slices - is the way to go. The one thing that bears mention is the wait. After you order be prepared to spend 40 minutes to an hour for your pizza to come out. This is partially because Dom expends a lot of attention and care on each and every pie that goes into his oven, but also because, at 645 reviews and counting, the cat's been out of the bag for a long time now, and the tiny shop is always filled to the brim (good luck getting a seat!). It might even take you 15 minutes to place your order. Because I know what I'm getting into, and it's the best pizza ever, I don't mind too much, but don't expect to double park outside and run back with a slice. Tomorrow I may go to some random pizza shop and be fine with my pizza, but I know that nothing can compare to this place. If I lived nearby I would eat this pizza every single day. It's the best. As I was saying, ohmygodohmygodohmygod. It's so good.For the uninitiated and fans alike, you should check out ""The Best Thing I Ever Done"", an ode to Di Fara - vimeo.com/16077855",1/9/2011,87,147,91,yVR1d-TDPugjeJNMrky_NQ

I finally had some time between jobs and my pizza cells were low so headed there hoping for a short wait. It's good but really? More than anything the crust and some ingredients on top make this pizza a bit special.The cheese is a bit below average.  It's above average overall but it's a joke that any real New Yorker will wait that long for pizza. If you want to.wait that long then move to Chicago (even in that time you could get a pie and eat it). There are tons of unfancy pizza and fancy pizza places all over the Boroughs that are just as good or better. It will take less time to go to L&B or Totonno's in Brooklyn or even Denino's in SI and actually eat it by the time you get pizza here. This place is a gimmick.

1480,Steven S.,0.0,4,"As with any experience at a famous eatery, one must not be overly influenced by the brand power. One must speak truth to pizza.I went to DiFara's a second time, because I really wasn't satisfied with my first trip. This time, I would show up when the place opened, order my own pizza so as to have it fresh, and not sit around waiting an hour for it only to be disappointed by all the hype. And I would bring a friend from Sweden, since it qualifies as a mini city adventure.Well, we arrived at 12pm, opening time (on a freezing cold day), and still ended up waiting about an hour. There weren't so many people in front of us, but Dom just makes those pies one... at... a... time. So waiting is probably in the cards for you no matter how well you plan your visit. Luckily, we snagged one of the four tables early.When our pizza finally arrived amidst the usual rituals, it was steaming hot, boilingly expensive, and large enough that my friend and I doubted seriously that we could finish it. In fact, we did, and it was an extremely satisfying, easy to eat meal. If I were to say anything more specific, it would be that the flavors were extremely well-balanced. I complained about the saltiness last time, but it didn't bother me as much this time. And the generous fresh basil is a really nice touch.That all probably doesn't make for a compelling-sounding review, but perhaps we Yelpers (Americans?) have too much of a tendency to spew superlatives all over every experience that is simply just good. The pizza is definitely above average, but I have to repeat my misgivings about it being worth the long trip and the long, uncomfortable wait. Up to you, pizza fans. As typical New York pizza, it probably is the very best. Compared to trendy places like Keste or Motorino, it may not be so distinguishable, but that may not be a fair or reasonable comparison.If you do go, ask to use the restroom. The back of the restaurant, where the ingredients are prepped, is actually pretty interesting to look at. Just be nice to the owners. They're all lovely people, but they're also human beings running a family-operated, New York institution that handles larger capacity crowds than most upscale, corporate-sponsored operations downtown. Be nice to them, and they'll be nice to you. Amazingly, they're even polite about letting you take photos. I can't believe they're opening a branch in Vegas. Are they going to clone old Dom and then teach the clone how to go through all those deeply embodied pizza making motions?Previous review plus this review = 3.5 stars average",1/14/2011Updated review,76,351,133,1aDE-Xns1vqHgQsegbQlcQ
1481,Louisa S.,0.0,5,"Di Fara gets five stars and deserves zero complaints, unless you don't know what to expect and end up waiting for an eternity to pay a lot of money for a pizza you don't even want anymore by the time it arrives. I get it -- that could be annoying. So read Yelp reviews and if it sounds like the kind of thing you're into, go! But go informed.1) People lie about the lines around the block being there at all times of day, all days of the week. They're *always* there on weekends during prime hours, yes. And they're often there after work hours on weekdays. And on summer Fridays, sometimes it is still crowded at 3pm. So it's hard to plan. Assume the experience will take a few hours. But know that if you time it right and get lucky, it might not! Use common sense -- early in the day is always less crowded. Rainy days are likely less crowded. 6pm will definitely be crowded.2) So, as people have suggested, bring some beer or wine! Bring a book or a game to play! A crossword! Family jigsaw puzzle? Be prepared to wait for 2 hours without a sour face. And be psyched -- it's your lucky day! the train's running express right to your stop! -- if it's not busy somehow when you walk in.3) It's dingy in there. Not like bad health inspection rating dingy. But not like they've renovated and made it into a retro-cutesy caricature of itself for your benefit. It looks how it looks and it is what it is.4) The pizza is amazing. But it's amazing in a classic way -- a perfected version of a simple thing. So don't go for the ""amazing pizza"" and then write a mean review about how it didn't have toppings like bacon and ramps and goat cheese. It's not that kind of place. That's not what we're all so excited about! It's the great tomato sauce, great mozzarella, and fresh basil, hand-cut by a delightful and committed older gentleman right on to your pie. Each pie is different -- some have slightly crispier crusts; some have more basil; some have more olive oil on top. Go with it. Love it.5) Don't be a tool about your table. There aren't many in there and you're not the only one waiting for pizza. Enjoy yourself, don't be rushed, but don't think you can hang out and have a few more drinks after you're done. Or someone is likely to start a fight with you. And you'll deserve it. It's just not that kind of place.

If you're a fan of thin crust, this will hit the spot.  It's a bit pricey compared to other pizzas (I think the classic was $32) but the TLC that goes into each pizza makes it worth it.  Definitely a must try if you're visiting or a native NYer like myself.",11/2/2015,37,25,0,STRmFW0DXsGiyj4Lg7WuCA

Apparently, the guy who makes the pizza moves at a molasses pace and he and his daughter are the owner.  So instead of hiring help, this old man that I like to refer to as grandpa rather does it all by himself and hence this is why they are always running out of ""pizza dough"" from 4-6:30pm, because grandpapa needs his cat nap.Don't get me wrong, the pizza is really just okay, but for the price that they are asking for it is so not worth it or the trip to the boom docks.CAUTION: Expect a very and I mean a VERY LONG ROPING LINE!!!",7/31/2013,531,489,2084,_x9_cICSRw-52vT9eBNa3A

1488,Nona K.,0.0,5,"Well I have finally decided to give MY FAVORITE PIZZA SPOT in the world a review....Some history... I've been coming here since 1995 when I was at Midwood HS (a few blocks down)... back then a slice and a soda was $2 and it was pretty much what i had every day after school on my way home (the Q train was the D back then.. stops one block away). Dom was of course, always being Dom. The difference?? No hipsters or tourists or ANYONE but those in the know... If you are going to bitch about price, go to Dominos, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc... and try not to die of food poisoning of the crap they serve you as ""pizza"". This is not the place for everyone... especially if you are short-tempered and have a time frame.I hear the food is great.. i wouldn't know as I've only had 2 things here in the entire 15 years I've been coming.For those who don't know, Dom DeMarco has been making his pizza by himself for many MANY decades (he's 80) and he is the ONLY ONE who touches the ingredients. It is why it takes 2 hours for you to get your pie. You meaning YOU hipster and tourist... Me? I'm a regular snob who doesn't wait (yea I went there... i don't wait. Tough shit.. and don't message me for my secrets... you can WAIT your turn)1) The Regular (round) Pie - Margharita made to perfection for you personally. No toppings for me on this one: just tomato sauce, mozz, basil and fresh oil. If there is a pie out to sell for slices, it will cost you $5 but man is it heavenly.. every so often Dom forgets about a pie in the oven and it comes out a bit burned on the edges.. when the dumbass in front of you turns it down just jump in and CALL it. His stupid ass will be waiting another 2 hours, not for the next pie that comes out.2) The Square Special Pie - This baby even i wait for :) I usually get mine with sausage, peppers and onions and it takes a while to make/cook/wait. If you have a group of 4 or more this is an awesome eating experience. It is a HUGE pizza. HUGE. You can get half a pie with whatever toppings and the other half with whatever other toppings. Everything is made for you, by Dom. Listen people, this is the best pizza in the world. If you disagree feel free to do so. If you don't want to wait or pay, don't.But do not sit around bagging on this legend. Just don't go. Makes the wait much shorter for the rest of us.Dom DeMarco is a living legend and if you don't try a pizza from Di Fara while you still can, you will be missing out.",1/7/2015,35,32,0,ooS-9xLiOk1R3xxq8f_FZg

1491,Sean C.,0.0,5,"When I walked into Di Fara and saw that a slice of pizza cost $5 in the middle of Midwood (where neighboring competitors are offering whole pizzas for a bit over $10) I thought to myself that it had better be the best slice of New York style pizza I've ever had.It was.I thought I was ruined for pizza outside of the Tri-State Area before, having slummed it in Seattle for over 6 years, but that effect has been upgraded. A chewy yet crunchy crust, buffalo mozzarella, a drenching of olive oil and a sweet sauce makes for a, if not the, superlative sicilian slice.It's not entirely perfect. Service is along the lines of reinforcing New York's detractors and not particularly friendly (although the other customers helped me out in terms of the ordering process.) Decor doesn't appear to have been updated (save for posting of stories over the years about Di Fara) since the 1960s.Honestly it doesn't even really matter.

Finally we made it in the line, and then eventually through the door, and then eventually placed my order.

I loved watching them make the pizza right in front of me, down to cutting up the fresh basil over the top.

1494,Steve L.,1.0,5,"5 stars means a place should be (one of) the best of the best in its category. Far too frequently, I find Yelpers overly generous with their ratings; for the record, this is my second 5 star review (and I think I'm going to downgrade my other 5 star review)!Having read all the press and hype about Di Fara, my expectations were raised to super high levels. I prepared myself for disappointment - after all, how can any restaurant live up to this much anticipation? The wait was as hideous as advertised; my friends and I were third in line (before opening) Sunday afternoon, and it still took over an hour to get our pizza!Tons of restaurants talk about ""beauty in simplicity"" and letting ""ingredients talk for themselves"" - precious few manage to execute that well. Di Fara was a mind-blowing experience for me; up until that point, I never realized pizza could be that good!I've had pizzas with traditional, top-notch, imported produce and all that jazz... but none of them come close to the magic of Di Fara! I wish I could pinpoint what made this pizza so great - the fresh cheese, basil, dough, or generous pour (this isn't diet food, folks) of olive oil - but I'll leave that to the folks with the better palette. All I know is: it works, and works great!Back to the point of simple ingredients: I enjoyed the plain Sicilian (square pizza with thicker crust) much more than the Sicilian with sausage.

1500,Rachel T.,0.0,5,"So, on the outside, Di Fara's is a real hole-in-the-wall. There are no special decorations and fanfare (even the sign is somewhat unassuming). And then when you step inside the glass doors...still looks like a hole in the wall. Looking over the front counter, you'll see an older gentleman (Dom Demarco, the owner) rolling out pizza dough in the back while the other women in the store answer phones and take orders. Apparently, this is how it's been even since the store first opened--Demarco painstakingly makes each and every pie that is ordered. This leads to my first tip--don't go if you're in a rush (or get one of the slices).As for the pizza itself, it's very much how a traditional NY slice should be: perfectly crispy and chewy crust covered in sauce in exactly the right amount with a uniform distribution of mozzarella. My favorite toppings are sausage and red peppers, but I'm sure even their plain pizza is delicious. Don't forget to ask for a container of their hot peppers in oil (for decorating the pizza and dipping). And, I should mention again, it takes a loooong time to craft this pizza, so bring a friend or a book.",1/5/2014,1,52,0,YWD21Aq2XIIZMt_mhT4wmg
1501,Matt E.,1.0,4,"I recently took another trip to DiFara's and managed to get there when they were actually open and because I went fairly early my wait for a pizza was only 45 minutes. Dominic DeMarco (the only one who makes the pizza's here) is still chugging along making one of the best pizza's in the world, certainly my favorite (or at least in the top 3) ever. Nothing has changed since my last review (so check that out for more details on the place) except for the prices. The prices have skyrocketed to $5 slices, $28 plain pizza, and I believe $32 for a square pizza. The ""square"" or Sicilian as some people call it is a thicker and more buttery (or oily?) crust with the same amazing ingredients. I resisted trying it because this type of pizza anywhere else in NYC is super thick and doughy, not to mention, not the classic New York styled pizza. After hearing so much about it at DiFara's I had to give it a try. I'm glad I did, it's not nearly as thick as any other place's, is still perfectly crispy on the bottom, and seems to hold a lot more toppings than your traditional pizza. Yes the crowd and lines here are unbearable, the space is kind of dirty and cramped and you have to be willing to shove people aside to grab a table when it frees up and yes it's cash only and it's expensive; BUT it's amazing pizza made the right way by the same guy who's been doing it in the same spot since the 60s. It's still worth the drive/subway ride and the wait (though he's certainly testing the limits of how much people will pay to line up for his pizza).UPDATE: Last time I came the squares were burnt to a black crisp and it wasn't just mine, I saw many others like it. When you're charging more than $30 for a cheese pizza, it's really not a great business model to let pizzas go out like this. At $5 and up for a single slice, it's pushing the value even if the pizza was cooked perfectly (which my traditional round pizza thankfully was).",1/18/2011Updated review,788,2204,1857,M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ

1508,Jeff Y.,0.0,4,"A great part of the pleasure of going here is watching Domenico DeMarco work. As is well known, he makes every pie served in this shop, which he has been running for 50 years. And there is plenty of time to observe him during the inevitable wait for your pizza, assuming you don't leave the shop during that time to walk around the rather charming side streets of Midwood. Seen from the front he looks older than he does in the painting of him that hangs next to the counter, his jowls pendulous and his back bent when he walks. He's 80 after all. He moves about the few square feet behind the counter with an almost robotic shuffle, not speaking to the customers, a job instead managed by his patient, attentive daughter, who writes down orders with a pen in 3x3"" squares she's drawn on a piece of lined paper, one square per pizza ordered, carefully and methodically ripping off each square as the corresponding pie is produced. His sons are there too, moving back and forth from the front to the back of the store, preparing ingredients and slicing the pies once they come out of the oven. But despite this well-oiled family machine, the pies themselves have no trace of a robotic aura to them, there is no question that they are human creations.Let me tell you about the pie my friend and I shared a couple nights ago. I'd poked my head in the shop before, but this was my first time eating there: and I will not say that what we ate was the very best pizza I've ever eaten. I'm a sauce guy. Many people will go on about the most perfectly singed crust with just the right thickness, or about the freshest cheese ever melted on a slice, and I think that's important, but a perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, and tanginess in the sauce, and enough of it, matter to me personally even more. The sauce yesterday did not hit me right on the nose! What did hit me on the nose was that human touch I mentioned, how casually Mr. DeMarco arranged his quality ingredients, much like in the great pizzas of New Haven (please - at Sally's Apizza): the crust bunched up and blackened more on one side than the other; the massing of the toppings on our divided circle - half sausage, peppers, and onions, half porcini mushrooms - uneven from slice to slice, and even shockingly spilling across the normally inviolable midline of the pie; the dough thinnest in the center of the circle and even soggy at some slices' tips (an affliction that affects whole slices at the sadly overrated Grimaldi's), growing in robustness and crunch as your mouth approaches the outer rim and you end that particular movement of the orbicular opus.This was a pizza full of personality, folk art with a touch of urbanity, more aligned with Darger than Degas. It had the taste of a home-cooked meal by a host so practiced, so casual, he seems almost careless. But in the end this carelessness redeems him. If this were not Dom's but Domino's, each pizza might be immaculate in its own watered-down way. But would you remember the taste of that particular pie? This is not the perfect pie to be framed and hung on the wall. This is just good pizza.",12/8/2015,0,1,0,n-5aoA6Ecfb-LD9wYgwcjA

So like it was seriously at the corner of Avenue J subway stop, which I used ALL the time going to and from the Murrow H.S. field during high school; I never knew this while in H.S. This made me really sad. But then we went to DiFara's and I wasn't sad anymore. First, I liked the pizza, it was a very good slice. Fresh and hot as hell. However, we waited 20-25 minutes for it! And it was like $5. These two facts run against the basic principles surrounding a great slice - it's fast and cheap. DiFara's was neither. Next time, I will skip the hype and go to PizzaMaster, my corner pizzaria which served me oh so well during high school. Now, I don't want to mar DiFara's slice, but I think nostalgia has a lot to do with how we view food.

It has a perfect thin crust with an earthy crunch and a tad of sweetness in the dough. The gravy is very light as the chucks of mozzeralla and olive oil take center stage. After baked to perfection, basil and ramano are sprinkled generously for a great garden and salty flavors. I will come back on a regular basis...Its rare these places live up to the hype...way to buck the trend and keep making these amazing pizzas",6/21/2015,230,510,8,eKpClGcH2afw2tvzZVOzBA

1547,J B.,0.0,4,"Di Fara's may be the truest study in gastro-ambivalence. Allow me to explain:I arrived with a colleague of mine at about 1:30pm this past Wednesday. We ordered a regular (i.e. round) pie and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes.The downside: the pie actually took 1 hour at what I consider to be somewhat of an off-peak hour. My colleague informed me that when she lived in Brooklyn, she came a few times a year and regularly waited 2.5 hours for a pie at peak times. Nevertheless, this seems to be almost banal to the extent that it is (and should be if you are new) entirely common knowledge. Simply put, know what you are getting yourself into.The upside: nothing less than the very best pizza you have ever tasted (at least if this particular day was any indication). The pie came out glowing with fresh basil and olive oil topping freshly grated Parmesan, mozzarella, and another kind of cheese which I could not name. I generally prefer a thicker crust, mostly because I often find the thin crusts to be over-cooked to the point of becoming brittle and cracker-like (think saltines). This crust, while thin, was cooked to perfection, with no excess flour, very little burning, and the perfect golden touch all over-I now know where all of the warmth and sun went missing that mid-July day (it was 70 outside)! The price is a bit on the high side-$28 for our pie-but allow me to stress again that you are getting the freshest of ingredients (one should dare to look around for the cows from which they must be making their own cheese)!Needless to say, if you have the time, I would trade many other culinary experiences to venture at least once in life out to Di Fara's to watch the old man prepping each pizza with old-town care and intentionality. In a world where truth can be hard to come by, this small nook in Midwood comes as close as any to showing us the meaning of that word.",7/27/2013,158,21,1,gNc1fGW5SlWerF1qInHFnw

I like fancy pizza, I like $0.99 pizza, I like pizza in general. before you haters attack me for not being a true pizza connoisseur or aficionado or enthusiast, I spent six months living in Italy so I get it. the pizza is delicious, there's no denying it. It tastes fresh, there's a great ratio of ingredients, and it's a gosh darned good slice.

It's seems the reputation has gone a bit to their heads, as the place isn't very clean, the tables are full of hours of pizza residue, the utensils are in a box; just because you're a great joint that can charge (barely) $5 per slice doesn't make getting a B by the health department fine and dandy. anywho, it's a good stop on your pizza journey through life.",3/7/2014,1,55,5,6ZHVMJAARKAa1jevo5CfUg

Or maybe earlier?It was my turn to order. ""A slice please!"" The woman at the counter retorted, ""$5"".  I paused in shock, thinking...nothing in the Slope or Brooklyn Heights is even that expensive. Nothing.

Of course the pizza ovens were not working in the morning so they tell us a 1-2 hour wait plus another one hour wait for the ovens plus another hour for all the other orders ahead of us. The helper  left the cage down so no one could sit or have a drink while they painfully waited  like second class citizens on a bread line. So pissed, never again.

1574,Chris C.,0.0,5,"Di Fara's pizza is the best you will have. Between the fresh basil, the drizzled olive oil, and the perfectly irregular but delicious crust, this stuff is a winner. I'll put it this way - it was good enough for me and my fiancee to eat an entire pie to ourselves. I gluttonously put down about 5 slices. No regrets.I think at this point, the quality is pretty well documented.Few things. First, at $28 a pie, you probably won't make eating here a twice-a-week occurrence. But it's absolutely worth checking out at least once. You won't regret putting down that much cash for what amounts to 8 slices.Second, if you want to try to beat the wait, go when it opens or at off hours. We went Saturday afternoon when they first opened. No wait at all. In fact, we had the first pie out of the oven in about 5 minutes.Third, when you get your pizza, give it a minute. It's hot. You'll burn your mouth. As anxious as you might be to taste the best pizza around, you can wait the 60 seconds for it to cool a little. This is more a reminder for me than for you.

Hey I am at fault too. The lady in line behind asked me if she was reading it right and if the price was indeed $5. I said yes, and as she was walking off, I found myself defending this place. I mean its my first experience, and there I am sounding like an affecionado. I told her that it is the best pizza in brooklyn and it is worth it....and I never tasted the damn thing! 1/53) Pizza is good, very good, a little too loaded with ingredients for italian standards, but we are in the US and Dom is catering to US taste where more is more. 4/5All in all I say how difficult is it to take fresh mozzarella di bufala, fresh tomato sauce, fresh basil, fresh parmesan and make a good pizza? Apparently it is and that is why everyone goes gaga here. But I am biased in two ways, my homemade pizza tastes similar, so I appreciate his pizza, as much as I can replicate it at home without paying him crazy prices.Two closing comments:1) the more time I spend in NY, the more I realize that it is a city populated with sheeps, quitely following the herd, in a unquestioning manner even if they overpay and wait in line. I see it over and over (56th street halal stand, Shake's, porchetta and the list goes on...)2) Italians have style, pay attention to detail, are proud of their sourrounding and care about design.

By the pie, not really relative to other top NYC pizza places (the slice price is high, but most top places don't serve slices). Is the pizza ""greasy""? Yes (and that's a stupid question. This is f'n pizza we're talking about). OK, now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'll just say that Di Fara's Dom DeMarco makes my favorite pizza in the world. Why? The flavor. No other place uses the ingredients Dom puts into his pies. Imported tomatoes. Imported olive oil. Fresh mozz. Fresh basil. And it all adds up to a pie like no other. The crust is thin, and there's lots of oil, so don't overload it. Go for no more than one topping. I recommend the pepperoni, baby artichoke or green olives. Or forget the toppings altogether. As I said before, the pie has plenty of flavor unadorned. In conclusion, If you like good pizza, you've got to give it a try. If you think Artichoke is good pizza, forget about it.

I have had horrible convenient lunchtime Korean-owned Italian restaurant pizza, I have had regrettable slices that were purchased in a drunken haze, I have had forgettable slices of I-don't-even-recall-what-was-on-it pizza, and I have had some incredibly tasty addiction-inducing pizzas. Above all, regardless of how shitty or great the pizza is, I always eat my pizza with meat on it. In fact, I only eat pizza with meat on it. Lo and behold, on my first trip to New York, my boyfriend orders me two slices of the regular Di Fara signature pie with cheese and basil sprinkled on top. This was a napkin-twisting moment for me. Pizza with no meat? GETOUTTAHERE. FORGETABOUTIT. PEPPERONIFORLIFE. We waited in a small line outside the shop before it opened. Once in, the ordering process was quick. Five slices came to us, just like that. The slices are visually unremarkable. They just look like your average pizza. Maybe this is why a disgruntled man bitched about having to pay $5 for the slice. Then he ate it and immediately STFU. The crust is subtly salted and perfectly crisp on the edge, chewy in the middle. The sauce is thick and savory, with chunks of sweet and mellow Roma tomatoes. The cheese has a bite to the creaminess that envelops the bits of basil sprinkled on top. The entire slice is drizzled with olive oil. All of these things combined made me forget all about my fascination with pizza meat. This here is truly a slice of heaven.",5/21/2013,92,53,41,NhWQDZs52uGQ0SvuBjJGAQ

I'm not hurt by it at all, I just have to accept the fact and go to any pizza joint he tells me to go to.  My girlfriend from Florida travels to NY and swears by Di Faras.  For some reason we never made it.It was early Saturday and he was craving the usual.  Luckily he finally picked Di Faras.   It was an easy subway ride to the place.  There is something so traditional in how they take orders on a yellow notepad with self made boxes.  Then, order by order, Dom (the owner) makes the pie, stretching out the dough and using fresh ingredients with his faithful tin of olive oil right next to him.We got to Di Fara's at the perfect time, just two people before us and it was just after 12:30 on a Saturday.   We put in our order for the Special and but waited till a little after 1 for our pizza.  Since we are both foodies, we know good things come to those who wait.    We were seeing our other food patrons order slices, but no...we were in it for the long haul and were about to defeat a whole pizza by ourselves.  Finally we were up, these cut the fresh basil onto our pie and we excitedly brought it to our table.  Yes, it was olive oily..luckily it's healthy for you right?  But the crust and cheese with all the yummy toppings were cooked to perfection and the ingredients tasted super fresh. ...My husband gave it the stamp of approval by killing 4 slices.  I had 2 and we were so full we contemplated of walking back home...BUT we took the subway anyway hahah1) Bring cash2) Go early (avoid the crowds)3) Be patient4) ENJOY!",9/27/2010,93,222,27,GnPIEtAOx4NsZuq9CNmEQA

After five minutes of waiting in line and finally shutting my mouth, it hit me ""Wait, why are we in line??  There is no one inside!!"". The man in front of me and my friend quickly filled me in about the place while waiting in line. Truth be told, I was relieved to find out that this place had really great pizza and it wasn't your average place. We finally got in and I realized that they only take cash and the slices were $5 each. In all honesty, it's pointless to just have one slice. Definitely go for the pie and bring some cash. In the end, it will be cheaper and you'll have more. I had one cheese slice and I wolfed it in seconds! The crust was just the right size and tomato sauce didn't taste like can! Also, I noticed the pizza wasn't overly greasy like most of the pizzas in NY. The combination of the cheese was delicious. Overall, it was great freaking pizza!The only down side is that if you are planning to sit down here, it will most likely NOT happen. It's really small and barely has any sitting area.

I've only tried the plain Sicilian slice and one with artichoke and they're both amazing. I love that they have San Pelligrino in various flavors well stocked at all times (MMM limonata...)

People don't mind waiting for something that is considered one of the best pies in NYC, but people do mind the conditions of the eatery. Eating at Di Fara can be a challenge. In between bites you have to fight off the flies and finding a decent chair to sit in is next to impossible. So while I love my Di Fara it upsets me that they don't give a shit about how the customer is going to sit and enjoy the slice or pie. Come on guys - Go to home depot or Target and buy a few decent folding chairs!  Also, I have to say it wouldn't kill anyone to wipe down the tables every so often.

1604,Dr. K.,0.0,5,"I remember going to this little hole in the wall 4 years years ago. I was visiting my son in his freshman year at Pace University in Westchester County. I asked one of the parents of my sons baseball team roommates where I can get the best pizza in New York. A dad recommended d'fara. It was a rainy night and I got there on GPS in my rental car. I ordered a slice of pepperoni. They said it would be ready in about 20 minutes, I said, ""excuse me?"" The man said,""Until we get enough slices to make a pie we don't make the pie."" OK so I strolled around the neighborhood a little bit. When I came back there was a large pizza box in the front of the door with the string holding it up that read,""sorry were closed, ran out of pizza dough"". I thought no way I came all the way for nothing? So I limbo danced under the string and got in and asked about my slice.  A gentleman said, "" yeah someone was looking for youz"". I finally got my slice. It was great. My only regret was that I couldn't order a whole pie to go! I'm from Los Angeles, I have not been back and my son graduated a semester early so we did not return for a graduation. Nevertheless, last year in Las Vegas I believe I was somewhere either at the Venetian Hotel or next door and I saw there was a d'fara pizza. I'll be going there next week. We'll see how that goes.",8/24/2016,19,33,4,4I7hz7w8HFZvyZZ4t4zRsg
1605,Nicholas G.,0.0,5,"A  moment on the lips, a lifetime of the hips. WHO CARES! Totally worth it! I would jog 100 miles a day if I could keep my figure and still have this divine pizza.Trust me, this is by far the best pizza you can ever have. If I was not so poor, this lovely hand-made pizza would be in my stomach everyday. I live 10 minutes away from Di Fara and I remember when I was younger I would go to the Avenue J library to ""study"" and then 2 hours later, I would buy a slice (of course it was cheaper then). It might be 5 dollars a slice/square, but just wow, MOUTH 'GASM! That basil, drizzled olive oil, cheese that is still sizzling, the oddly shaped thin crispy crust. I can't even describe the feelings that go into this pizza.  Di Fara is simply a must for any pizza connoisseur.  Some helpful tips:1) I think it is 27 or 28 for a pie now. Totally worth it, because you cannot stop at one.2) Do not try to go here on Monday and sometimes Tuesdays (varies by season) as they are closed! 3) Q train to Avenue J is the only way here! 4) Be wary on Fridays, it can be really crowded. I waited an hour once for this pizza, totally worth it. This is the only pizza I would ever wait over 15 minutes for. 5) I think they implemented a no photo policy without permission now, but never stops anyone!Seriously, worth it over and over again.",11/1/2012,14,16,2,rYm9gDKg6_vPnsHLGTTP0A
1606,Vince C.,0.0,5,"Wanted to leave a review for this place due to lack of consensus of food:Drove down to Di Fara after spending some time at Brooklyn Promenade and eating ice cream there. I wasn't hungry at all but then when I walked into the store and smelled the air (a mix of burnt crust along with sizzling cheese), I was hungry again.We found parking across the street luckily and proceeded to line up. We were ""lucky"" and lined up for 20 minutes and left our order so they could commence baking. We ordered 2 pepperoni and 1 mushroom because we saw how good it was when other people were eating it. We were told that the square slices would have to wait 30 min and the round slices were 20. By this time, we had waited 20 min, so another 30 would result in my stomach eating itself - so we decided to go with round slices.After 15 minutes, they called our name to come up and pickup and pay. We had found a seat in a dirty table in the back, but we were happy to find a seat.Unfortunately, as we went up to pick up, we realized the famous old man had screwed up our order and instead, we got:1 x mushroom pizza slice1 x sausage pizza slice1 x artichoke pizza sliceThe young man who took our order was extremely apologetic, but we didn't want to wait another 15 to 20 min AND waste freshly made pizza, so we decided to give it a shot.... And it was the best decision we ever made!The mushroom slice was 7/10, excellent aroma and juicy mushrooms without sogging the crust. The crust was amazingly fresh and somehow crunchy yet soft... crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It lacked a kick of flavor though. (but smelled damn good!)The sausage slice was 9/10, the sausage was still sizzling and whatever flavor mushroom lacked, sausage delivered and then some. We still need to try pepperoni but man, the sausage was full of grease (yummy grease, don't judge!) and was exactly how a sausage + cheese + pizza crust should be. It lacked mushroom's awesome aroma but the flavor was full and didn't disappoint.Finally, we came to the artichoke pizza... and man i'd give it 12/10 - and it was even better than artichoke pizza's artichoke pizza. THIS is a bold statement, I know. I waited outside for 30 minutes in the middle of freezing February for artichoke pizza at artichoke pizza and it was awesome and well worth it. But! But! This place's artichoke gave me several pieces of FULL artichoke... literally the ingredient was thicker than the 3 times the crust. The artichoke was really fresh because when you bit into it, the full flavor + full aroma danced in your mouth into an expertly created topping selection.I had to thank the younger gentleman for Di Fara's error - and he laughed: ""the artichoke is the chef's special ingredient this week"". No joke, it delivered. Try it! Note: as we left the restaurant at 7:45 pm, the line had tripled.",8/12/2012,2,44,22,hHXhLIsZJP46qPSiqwdKeA

1611,Sam M.,0.0,5,Came here spur of the moment yesterday because I was craving pizza and I recall this place before yelp took it mainstream. Nothing has changed except of the wait. Before the doors were open there was a line of 10 people ahead of me. When I got inside I can see Dominic churning out the pies like he use to back when I was in high school. Though I don't recall much about the pizza back then I got to try the slices and the square. The slice wasn't great though u do taste the quality. The best for me was the square. It was so crunchy and the sauce was on of the best tasting sauce. I might even say that I like this square more than L&B. Yes I said.,2/15/2015,38,128,18,_3W6JklsCc0W_q6LhjHUjw

It was hands down the best pizza we've ever had. The tomatoes and basil were amazing and so so fresh. Most endearing was that our pizza was not even round. I mean, it was close to being a circle but clearly deformed. But it's a testament to the hand-made goodness and authenticity of someone in the biz for so many years that it just doesn't matter how it looks because the taste is beyond perfection. We haven't been back yet because it's a bit of a trek out and also I'm afraid of tainting my great memories of that day. Sigh.",9/9/2015,1,28,0,Er7D86Xzxcd3YjYEc_QQQw
1614,Katelyn S.,0.0,4,A bit over rated and over priced. I won't knock that it's a good slice though. I can only explain the pizza as angry sex. You're so angry you waited so long but it's so delicious and you want more. Eat it while it's hot.,5/31/2016,0,17,6,w_WnFQD0MmEiJE-TPN3Uxg

It was well worth waiting 45 mins before they were set to reopen for the evening. I only got a few slices since I was still young with no job at that time, but next time I make it out there I may even get myself a whole pie. Dom calmly just makes each pizza with imported Italian ingredients while handling oven baked pizza with his bare hands.

1617,Abdul S.,0.0,4,"This is my first review on yelp and of course it begins with non other than my favorite Pizza joint in the world. When I was a teen, I use to go here often. Especially because my high school was a block away (ERM). The first time I had a slice from Di Fara. I was blown away. It was just perfect. The three cheeses (buffalo mozzarella, padano, and pramigiano reggiano all imported from Italy)., the fresh tomato sauce made from san marzano tomatoes, the imported flour from Italy, mixed with Brooklyn tap water. Garnished with fresh basil from Israel. Damn, I am salivating just thinking about it. Eating pizza from Di Fara's is an experience. The moment you walk in, to your left is the counter. You will most likely see Mr. DeMarco crafting what he is known best for, all by himself! Straight ahead are some rustic tables and chairs. You will not get a seat most of the time. And the aroma of cheese, bread and tomatoes are in the air. Inhale deeply and consume it. I waited up to an hour for a pie. But no complains from me. I am definitely a fan of Di Fara's Pizza. It would get 5 stars from me, if the slice was still $2.50. like the old days! But nonetheless, I still go back from time to time. I usually eat a pie to the face.",8/17/2015,1,21,21,CQDlsQNieSFCKoFsvUmD7A

""They have some nerve...How do they get away with this wait and these insane prices?!?""  It's because the pizza is really good, that's how. The point is, if you're willing to trek out to Midwood you should also already know about the expected wait time. The pizza isn't my all-time no.1 but it's not far from it either. I especially like how Mr. Di Fara picks the basil straight off the plant immediately onto the pie. Even if the thought of a long ride on the Q followed by an epic wait depresses you, this is on the required eating list to pass NYC Pizza 101 so you may as well do it.",6/12/2012,217,146,12,YGHp8XlRkzbXQyGLh7U0Eg

Every bite was the perfect amount of crisp and cheesiness. The ingredients blend together so well. GET THIS!!!The plain pie was the best I have ever had, crust was crispy and almost burnt, cooking to perfection. The cheese and sauce with that hint of olive oil makes my mouth melt as I am writing this! I don't know how he does it with the same ingredients going into every pizza but for some reason Dom's combination works marvelously.",4/23/2015,0,12,0,nY-3toPivJcdo7unKVBEkg

It's New York, I know, but please, do yourself a favor and order the square pie. The crust is perfectly cooked: crispy on the bottom, flaky in the middle, and buttery soft at the top where the bread meats sauce. Toppings are not gourmet, but top notch for a ""pizza joint."" It's not trendy, there are no special ingredients or gluten free options and the bathroom is absolutely disgusting, but the taste alone will usher you back to an era before any of that garbage mattered.

Let me make this clear: the pizza IS GOOD.Cons: $5 a slice/ $28 a pie- makes this the most expensive pizza I've ever encounteredThey have a tendency to burn (char) the crust. Self admittedly. ""That's how we make it""For the price, the venue is the pits. It's old and dingy, and HOT. Don't plan to eat in.Although there was a grade of ""A"" in the window, I'm not positive they're meeting codes. The guy was handling money, cutting pizza, and paper toweling his sweaty face down the whole time I was waiting, and I did not see him wash his hands. Maybe it adds to the flavor.

We got there at about noon and actually got a seat(they opened earlier than normal and the rush was gone). It was sultry inside. The folks serving were very courteous. They suggested the square pie. We waited about 15-20 min and received the most spectacular, piping hot, crunchy yumminess.  It took all our will power to wait 5 min as the wait staff suggested before eating, to let the pie cool down. Of all the toppings, the sundried tomatoes stole the show. We left stuffed and satisfied. We get it... Di Fara is all that. The father and son duo working the shop (alongside one other non-family member) was so touching. I asked what the secret to the place was-- all the ingredients are sourced from Italy.

1666,Roberta W.,0.0,1,"I wish I could review the pizza, but we never got any. Dom's daughter told us our pie would be about 30 minutes, maybe 40. After 90 minutes, still nothing. We checked in a few times, and were repeatedly told, ""Just five more minutes"" or something similar. We didn't want to wait any longer and got up to leave. She berated us and told us that if we left now, everyone else would have to wait even longer and it would be our fault. What? She continued yelling at us, basically saying that we couldn't leave. My husband told her we wanted to pay for our Cokes and go. First she wouldn't take the money, continuing to yell at us. Finally, she said it would be $4 (for two half bottles). My husband gave her a $20 -- she put it in the cash register and walked away. He actually had to ask repeatedly for our change, all the while getting yelled at by her for not wanting to stay longer. The pizza looked good, but the place itself is extremely dirty. During our time there, no one cleaned any of the tables. They were covered in parmesan cheese, dirty napkins, spilled drinks, etc. I heard one of the customers complain that his chair was broken, another pointed out that upholstery stuffing was spilling out through a large tear in his seat. The bathroom is really bad, thick mildew on the sink, filthy floor...not good. I wish we could have tried the pizza, but the service was such a turnoff. I get that Di Fara's is extremely popular, but it would be nice to feel like customers were valued. While we waited, there were a number of customers who approached the counter to ask how long the wait was. Each time, the cashier would shoot them a dirty look, say nothing, and walk away. I don't get it. Considering how long the wait is to eat here, it seems like a fair question. We have tried a lot of pizza since we moved out here. Grimaldi's and La Suprema actually made us feel like they wanted us to be there. And their restaurants were clean.",10/2/2014,4,9,0,gZDN33Lx9kmwYRegeJHgSg

We've driven an hour into Midwood (not much happening there) for what's supposed to be one of the best pies in the city only to be disappointed. At $30 a pop, the pie was just not that great - I think I'd made better ones in my kitchen - sorry. The crust was dry and doughy, but not nicely chewy or charred. I am the type who ALWAYS eat my crusts (my favorite part of the pizza really), but this was the first time I left them unfinished and I judged myself for that. My friend who claimed that this was her favorite pizza in the city (which sold it to me) has been here 7 or 8 times before and said that the pizza was different this time around. While it's nice seeing Dom DeMarco in action (I kept thinking: why was no one helping him?!), I don't think I'm ever coming back.

The line does not appear long, but you will probably be waiting over an hour for a fresh pie. A single man perfects each pizza himself, as he a done for several decades. Places like these are truly special. The smells and sights that come from the open counter area is tortuous during the wait. However, make some friends in the meantime, as the locals are friendly and like to chat. Your finished pie comes out finished with freshly cut basil leaves and whatever ingredients you choose. Do select whatever toppings you prefer, there is no wrong choice. The finished pizza is worth the wait, as you will likely be unable to last long enough before taking a bite, and sitting on the sidewalk to finish, hopefully with new friends.Score is based on overall experience, considering food, comfort, and lasting impression.",10/1/2012,555,14,8,K01ALYnIV2iF59ExQOrrOw

He also sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan over the fresh pie.  The Mushrooms and Onions were fresh and added the right amount of texture to the pie.  The crust was just right, not too crunchy and not too soft!  We took it easy by ordering only Mushrooms and Onions but next time around, we'll make sure to go crazy because gosh, if this was as good as it was, I'm sure everything else will be too!All in all, Di Fara's position on all of the top 10 lists for Pizza in NYC is definitely well deserved.  The trip to Brooklyn, even if it took a little longer than expected, was well worth it!  Fortunately, when we visited (close to closing time), there was only one person ordering from the window.  We basically had the seating area to ourselves!  Find a way to make it out to Brooklyn to enjoy the Di Fara's pizza.  Really, I think you'll love it!If only every pizzeria cut fresh basil for every pie they made.  That might lead to a perfect world!  I guess we'll never know!",8/12/2012,36,157,93,_4CdrjdNhxjj4SDtx0SZdA

Instead it took about 40 min for our pizza to be made on this Friday evening. The square Sicilian slices took longer. I loved the crust and fresh basil. The star was the amazing Parmesan. It had the strongest flavor after the basil. With a nice char on the crust, the standard slice stayed crispy even till the last piece. Our first square slice was amazing but the second was quite oily. All the slices are oily, they pour olive oil on it but still wasn't too heavy.In all, flavors were slightly less than  Artichoke's margarita - less cheesy, less oily, and less thick.

I find this absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous especially when your Classic pie cost $32 and your slices are $5. You better have a repair guy that has a special line for when you call like the red bat phone or something at those prices. Maybe its the numerous highly rated reviews we've read or maybe it was because my friend and I have been talking about paying Dom DeMarco a visit for 2 years now.

Let's see..The hype definitely hits while you're waiting and reading the articles that the restaurant was featured in. You start to drool when the parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil is sprinkled onto each pie.  We ordered two slices (one regular & one with porcini mushrooms). My porcini slice came out to $7?! I actually wanted another topping but since those toppings were considered special my slice only would've cost me $9. The pizza was good but I prefer my sauce to be a little more tangy like L&B's. I was told by a my bf who used to live in the area that the pizza used to be paper thin which is all in the past.I do suggest you to get a whole pie. They charge $5 for a regular slice while a regular pie cost $28. Their slices are pretty small and I left Di Fara's hungry.",4/17/2011,161,244,889,977iuLgSiG85t0kK2uLA7w

1700,Aryeh P.,0.0,2,"This has got to be the most over hyped place in New York or anywhere, at least when it comes to quality pizza. I first tried Di Fara's like 10 years ago when I was a teen, and remember it having been super under whelming. Well, now that I'm older I wanted to give it a second chance, and the result is tragic. This place SUCKS. I came in hoping to once again give the mushroom slice I had as a teen a second chance, and try their famous square slices. Just because you cover something in olive oil and add basil to it does not make it quality Italian food. The mushroom slice ($6) had more Parmesan on it than mozzarella (ever watch Do The Right Thing? it's like that), the whole slice was just slimy and flappy, no consistency to how the cheese was laid out, it was like splotches of cheese, areas missing sauce or cheese, puddles of olive oil, and about 2 slivers of mushroom (not exaggerating), and the crust was nothing to brag about. It took about 35 minutes to get that one slice. 10 just waiting for his daughter to take the orders, this was at 1pm, there were like 4 guys in front of me, and she wasn't running back and forth busy, she took her sweet time to start taking orders; then another 25 before I got the slice. Next was the famous square ($5) which I've heard so much about. Another 20 minutes before I could get it. His daughter pulled out some large ready made/cut dough square from the freezer, placed it inside the square pan, and then let her dad (the old guy) do his thing. The square was ok, but it was still absolutely mediocre. It wasn't as sloppy as the mushroom slice, but it was so oily that the crust was transparent, but despite the oil the crust was still super brittle. There is nothing special at all about the pizza in this place, other than it is incredibly over priced and over hyped. I should also add that the pan seemed to be covered in gunk and chunks of other pizza, as did the oven although he did brush it with a broom, the place just doesn't feel clean. In all it took almost an hour to get 2 completely average pizza slices. I get the appeal, old guy making pizza forever, small place with nostalgic character etc, but the end game here is good pizza and this place is nowhere near what people say it is. Just a few doors down is Benny's brick oven pizza, love that place, ate there several times, I strongly recommend them over Di Faras, even Jerusalem Pizza, another block down, is better and higher value than this.",9/6/2014,2,8,3,LTYGgJc9sE0GnX48-6SFVg

A bit overpriced but since most ingredients imported from Italy kinda can see why it's a bit more. Overall really good tasty traditional NYC pizza! You'd think with all that $$$ they'd fix up the place a bit more as barely enough room for people to sit and eat and almost a soup nazi type of feel to the place as the godfather (Dom) is great at what he does and still at it after all these years!

Dom was there, making the pies, but our $28 classic (cheese) pizza came out very burnt.  The burnt crust overpowered the rest of the flavors, making it difficult to even eat the pizza.If there was any of Dom's buffala mozzarella on the pizza, we sure couldn't see or taste it, which was also a disappointment.The only distinction Di Fara's earned was the freshly-cut basil, a good way to enhance the flavor of the pizza.Sadly, I must say that I will not be returning to Di Fara's -- There are plenty of better pizza joints in New York City.",3/13/2013,3,10,0,UENlaJSQr6MEjukHrVZfhw

1727,Josh K.,1.0,4,"I understand that this place has a polarizing effect on Yelpers. On the one hand, this pizza is truly a labor of love and I'm pretty sure we'll agree on that. On the other hand, service is eccentrically slow, slices are expensive, and the quality is neither super-consistent, nor is it /significantly/ better than any other New York pizza.I really enjoyed the slices I had (one square slice with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and one virgin regular slice). There was no pizzagasm. It was just a good all around slice, slightly burnt on the edges, great fresh basil flavor, and most certainly made with concentration and effort.But I understand that many people build this place up as the be-all and end-all of pizza places, and when they're disappointed, recommend that no one else should waste their time here and that the prospective pizza eater should just go to any old pizza joint that's convenient. I think that's too harsh, as I really enjoyed myself, but if you're not interested in a 'pizza experience', you can probably save a couple bucks going elsewhere.Though I like this place, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here on a regular basis.

This is one of only two places in NY that I truly miss while I'm in SF.

1742,Megan L.,0.0,5,"You may have heard of DiFara's from the Food Network, the Travel Channel (or, hey, even Playboy, so their website claims). I remember hearing how people stand in line for hours-rain or shine, quite literally-and travel the world just to watch an nonagenarian Italian man meticulously cut fresh basil on an equally meticulously prepared pizza-this man who had been singlehandedly making the same pizzas for 50 years, allowing no one else (not even kin) near his pies. Food shows dramatize a lot but, this time, they weren't kidding.I was reluctant to try out DiFara's, especially when I heard it was in the-middle-of-nowhere Midwood. After passing Hasidic Jews lining up at a similarly dinky pizza shop (""kosher"" in big letters out front) a block away, we entered the fluorescent-lit, linoleum-lined small shop of old man DiFara. With everything paneled in fake wood, plastic tablecloths and framed newspaper clippings cluttering the walls, I felt like I was walking into my great-grandfather's house in Sheepshead Bay. It was an off-hour (4:30pm) and people were still packed in from the door in. There was no clear line or any indication of how to order. People were just hovering around, the tension hanging so palpably in the air-tension from impatience, tension from watching out of the corner of your eye for a free seat to snag, tension from anxiety over when your name is going to be called.After waiting stupidly ""in line"" for 10 minutes, we finally figured out that we had to go straight up to the counter to order. DiFara does not let anyone touch the pizza so his nephew, who himself was also somewhat old, decrepit and hunched over, was resigned to writing down orders (and occasionally mixing tomato sauce in the back). Sometimes he would whisper and lean in to DiFara to discuss when the next pie would be done. But that was it: it was essentially a two-man operation. Or one-man.Instead of ordering an individual $5 slice, P and I wanted to make it worth the wait so we ordered a full cheese pie for $28. Steep, I know, but it was worth it. The nephew said it would be a 45 minute to an hour long wait. It ended up being an hour and a half. P and I passed the hour watching DiFara at work-how worked the dough with his fists (no stereotypical tossing in the air!), how he sprinkled the fresh soft mozzarella, how he meticulously snipped (as on TV!) the fresh basil from Italy (still bundled together with a pink rubber band) with metal scissors onto the steaming hot pies. Everything was done at a glacial but artful pace: he seemed to be meditating on every ingredient that he placed on each pie, much as Jackson Pollock would meditate and inject his subconscious onto the swirls that he splashed on his canvas.It turns out that such meditation didn't only occur during the actual crafting of the pizza but also in the preparatory selection of the ingredients-something that we only found out after tasting the pizza. After an hour and a half of alternating between watching DiFara and people-watching other impatient customers , we finally received our pizza. We were going to take it to go but we decided to eat it right away, right of the box.The cheese formed a gooey, oily marshland in the middle so that separating slices was hard but we didn't mind. We also didn't mind that you could actually taste the cups of olive oil heaped on top of the pizza because it was so pungently olive-flavored (unlike most olive oils native to the US). The cheese was clearly fresh and probably imported from Italy but, but like the tomato sauce, it took a backseat to the overwhelming freshness and crunch of the basil. Most diners take issue with the fact that cheese and tomato-the essence of pizza-play such a minor role but, once again, we didn't mind. The basil, like the olive oil, was just so basil-y. There is no other way to put it. It all boils down, once again, to the freshness and probably to the fact that DiFara sources ingredients from his native Italy. The crunch and herbiness of the basil cut the fat of the cheese and refresh the palette, almost fooling you into thinking you're getting your daily dose of greens. The crust was also of note. Many Yelp reviewers complained that their crust was too charred to be edible. Although the crust is more like a blackened cracker (probably full of carcinogenic carbon), this smokiness only added to the symphony flavors already hitting the tongue. The char was a taste of the bread-y air that hung heavy in the pizzeria, a taste of the accumulated memories in that oven that has been churning out hundreds of pizzas for decades. I detest being trite but DiFara's pizza trite but DiFara's pizza tells a story of contrast, a story of the terroir of Italy: the spring-light versus the dirt-earthy ingredients; the sensuous melt versus the masculine-born-of-the-soil crunch.This is a true gem-but a temporary one, at that. Perhaps, it is precisely this fragility and nostalgia that we smell in the room and taste in the char.",7/1/2014,414,5,10,_znyuFnwF725pMZVgNQltw

Di Fara's which is conveniently located a block away from the train station was easy to find because I could (sniff sniff) smell the pizza dough and cheese cooking in the oven mmmmAs I walked into the decrepit little shop full of mismatched tables and wobbly chairs, I spotted my friends seated at the very back sweating in the humidity under an ancient fan covered in dust. (Do they clean this place at all?) A pizza was being pulled out of the oven and the line getting longer and longer by the minute. Sadly, this pizza was not ours. Nor were the several others that followed. As we starved it out in the humidity sipping on our sodas I wondered how Dominoes could get me my pizza in twenty minutes and Di Fara's couldn't. One friend jokingly commented that he had probably gone to Italy to pick it up. After forever (one hour and forty six minutes in the humidity being forever in my humble opinion) our names were called and we dug into the crunchy cheese pizza with globs of mozzarella and snippets of basil strewn over. It was good... really really good. The special wasn't that memorable though, I just remember biting into some capsicum and thinking the square pizza was much better. Best pizza in New York? Arguable.

Great crust, well seasoned sauce, three types of cheese (a combination that you will not get anywhere else), fresh cut basil, and lathered with delicious olive oil.However, there's something different from the square pie, it takes the pizza to a whole different level. The pie is double baked and olive oil is put under the pie while it's baking. Along with a more robust crust, the bottom has a perfect crunch. Simply the best crust you will ever have.The tips:It's closed Monday and Tuesday. Go early, before it opens so you can order before the pies are made. After ordering a pie, you can wait over an hour.The square pie takes extra long because of the double baking.The bad:Fine, it might be one of the dirtiest, most run down places I've ever been, but I'm here for pizza.

1753,Robert M.,0.0,4,"Di Fara is the single best pizza I have ever had in my life, and that's saying something because I have eaten at many of the best places in NY and elsewhere. That said, I can only give Di Fara 4 stars as a restaurant.Di Fara is a pilgrimage for anyone who cares about pizza - you have to come here. Watching Dom make pizza in his slow, methodical fashion is an incredible experience, and as I said, the pizza here is as good as it gets. However, after you've been here once or twice and experienced that, it becomes difficult to justify coming back. You want to come back, because the pizza is amazing...but you're in NYC, and there are a lot of amazing pizzerias here. Sure, I believe that Di Fara makes a better pie than Motorino or Patsys, but a marginally better pie usually isn't worth the pain of going to Di Fara. The pain is real - the 2-3 hour combined subway ride/wait, worrying if you are going to be able to get a table, dealing with the lack of air conditioning if its summer, having to go to CVS across the street for a restroom, and then once you get your pie, feeling rushed because there are 3-4 tables and everybody wants your spot. So Di Fara is never able to be a truly amazing dining experience.The best way I can find to sum it up: The pizza that Dom Demarco makes is the best pizza in NYC, and when he's really on maybe the best in the world, but Di Fara is far from the best *pizzeria*.",6/27/2012,9,17,0,G2Z4xw8YTx6AcB1n0jmDww

1755,Wing L.,0.0,5,"I finally decided to bite the bullet and try out Di Fara Pizza today.  In fact I was determined to see why so many people, magazines, blogs, and newspaper call it the best pizza around. I looked up the hours for the pizza shop and found out from Yelp that they close for two hours from 4pm to 6pm.  Oh Oh.  I had half an hour and it would take me about 20 to 25 minutes to get there according to my gps.  Off I went driving like a mad man, determined to bite into that pizza no matter what.  By luck there was a free parking space right in front of the store. Yahoo!!!  I parked there, hopped out to pay the meter and discovered that the meter was out of order.  Free parking.  Double yahoo!!!I ran to the door.  It was 3:55pm.  5 minutes to 4pm.  I made it.  Dancing with joy, I was about to open the door when I noticed the store hours posted on the glass.  The store closes at 4:30pm to 6pm.  What?  Yelp gave me the wrong closing hours and I drove like a crazy person, risking life and limb to get to this pizza on time and I didn't need to?  Thanks Yelp.  That pizza better be worth it.So was it worth the trouble?  Hell yes.  That is some magic tasting pizza.  It was soft, thin, chewy without being soggy and wimpy.  There are burnt edges here and there but somehow it adds character and flavor to the pizza instead of detracting from it.  The cheese literally melts in your mouth.  They grate fresh Parmesan behind the counter and you are free to use as much as you want.  If you want to add a spicy kick to the pizza, they also provide a wonderful pickled red pepper in oil that you are free to pile on. That red pepper was so good.  Just be aware that the pizza is very oily (they put in olive oil while making the pizza).  If you are one of those people that like to soak up the oil in your pizza before eating, get a lot of tissues ready.  I'm pretty sure there would be those that will lower the score by 1 or 2 stars for this but it doesn't bother me much here for some reason.Is it the best pizza out there.  Maybe not but it is among the top few. Is it worth 5 bucks a slice?  It depends on how you look at it.  I for one believe food should be judged on if the quality of the food is up to the price they are demanding.   If they ask for 5 bucks and it's substandard or ordinary then hell no. Although I do wish that it was more affordable at least they justify it by their quality and the time and care he puts into each pie.   Besides, if I worry about the price of everything I eat I would never end up in a five star restaurant.  The owner is the only person making the pies here and it takes a while for each one (thus the long waits). I was here for 45 minutes and it wasn't even that crowded at the time so people that come here better be patient. The whole place is very old looking.  If you need a place to be spotless before you could order food, this is not the place for you.  Also people should be aware that each slice is pretty small.  It's about 2/3 the size of a regular pizza slice from most pizza shops.I guess that it's a blessing in disguise that it's 5 bucks a slice and 25 bucks for a pie because otherwise I'll gain so much weight from eating there non-stop. I could not afford to, but I'll be back once in a while for sure anyway.  Next time though,I'll ignore Yelp when it's telling me that this place closes at 4pm for two hours since I now know it's wrong.One more thing.  Yelp is also wrong about Tuesday.   Di Fara is actually closed on both Mondays and Tuesdays now even though Yelp states that on Tuesdays they are open.  Di Fara have changed their store hours a few months back but Yelp apparently haven't updated this information.  Writing a email to Yelp about this little boo boo of theirs so hopefully they would update it soon.  Don't want anyone to fly from California to eat Di Fara's pizza just to find out they are closed on Tuesday.  There's my good deed for the day.Update: Yelp got my email and they corrected Di Fara's business hours on Tuesday 1-12-10.  Ok now back to eating.",1/8/2010,449,376,2226,6I042PLRiYub7RvufcqjZQ

I think many of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp must be from out-of-towners who don't know any better because there is no way this pizza should have the reputation it has.

And again, this is coming from a native NYer where I'm accustomed to everything being expensive, but this is just freakin' ridiculous! The neighborhood that pizzeria is in and the size of the establishment tells me that the owners are making a KILLING in profits. I just don't see the justification of a 5 dollar slice and a 30 dollar pie for average pizza - and let me say that I will happily pay above-average prices for really good food. And I won't even get into how long we had to wait for the food, ugh!!! Welp! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I've experienced it, I'm not impressed and I won't be back.

Then eat at the 2,387 other pizza parlors in town.It ain't rocket science. This is how you do it:Step 1: Order a regular pie[1] at the counter. Step 2: Wait for your pizza.[2] Step 3: Watch the old man remove the hot pie from the oven, top it with freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, snipped basil leaves, and extra-virgin olive oil.Step 4: Eat.Step 5: Consider moving (back) to Midwood even though you'd be bored out of your mind in the down time waiting to eat Di Fara's pizza again. For me, Di Fara's has all the elements of the Brooklyn pizza par excellence: a thin, chewy crust that's supple enough to fold; specks of black oven char on the bottom of the crust; tangy-sweet tomato sauce; a generous layer of gooey cheese to weigh down the tip of a slice; and that special ""liquid gold""--the pool of orange grease that collects in the creases of the cheese. Yet it's the basil (flown in from Israel) that perfumes the pie with that extra sumthin' sumthin'.On a recent visit with my friend, a funny, chatty guy struck up a conversation with us. He starts name dropping Oprah and cooking for the Governator and Maria Shriver...when it clicks: ""Oh, you're Oprah's personal chef!"" (Art Smith--love this guy!

They usually cook an extra pie for individual slices.  GET THEM!- Bring snacks and possibly a folding chair.  We were 7th in line and waited an hourThe pizza is amazing.  The old guy cooking knows what he is doing.  However he is the only one making pies and only utilizes one of the six ovens so he can only cook two pies at a time.  Though when your pie comes out of the oven and you watch that beautiful old man drizzle extra virgin olive oil, fresh cut basil, and parm cheese over your boiling hot pizza - you tend to let the other things slide.  All in all, the pizza is very good but to trek out there, wait, wait, wait, stuff your face, then trek back may be more trouble than it is worth.",5/24/2012,10,15,0,_FBvjevwtHCkDM6qijaHIA

I've never had to wait extremely long, then again, I've gone pretty early in the day. I'd recommend it only for die hard fans who don't mind waiting a little extra for their pizza.

PIZZA: 4.5 starsSERVICE: 2 stars CLEANLINESS: 1 stars ATMOSPHERE: 3 stars (4.5+2+1+3)/4=2.625 rounded to 3 stars. The pizza was great. It was really good. The different cheeses and the dough was excellent. I love how he was very generous with the basil. The tomato sauce was just tomato sauce (I think literally from the can). But it was cooked so well... 1 pie 2 people and we came out empty handed.  Service... I wish the lady in the front was more honest about the time it would take for the food to be ready. I mean, I knew I was walking into a long wait... but there are other things to do in the area (Coney Island or Prospect Park) but she said about 30mins which didn't feel like enough time to go to either or. So we walked around the neighborhood (which is dead on Saturday late afternoon). In the end... we got our pie about 1.5 hours after we ordered it. The line surprising wasn't that long... we were the 3rd people the order as soon as we walked in. Majority of the people were waiting for their food. Cleanliness... wow. I am SO surprised that this place got an A. After taking a walk to the bathroom, I really wanted a shot of something hard to sanitize my stomach just in case. (By the way, does this guy ever go to the bathroom? in THAT bathroom?) He does not use gloves or plates or .... towels?Atmosphere. This was very hole in the wall, dive place. It felt old, tattered and worn out. Nice! But the seating situation... annoying. It is a little pricey ... but the food was worth it. The pizza was definitely good but this is another tried it move on. Not going to become a frequently visitor here. But I am glad I have tried it.",5/7/2012,68,162,5,X8IHQ_kQHQF-v4YCiFVtUQ

After the haul up the parkway over the whitestone bridge and into the bowels of Brooklyn We found the oasis of pizza called Di Fara!Well it is hot as the ovens in there, there is about 4-5 tables strewn into the corner but if you are patient you can enjoy your pizza with the crown around you looking jelous and watching the fresh basil that Dom just snipped onto your pie meld into the cheese.We opted for the regular pie although upon seeing the ""square"" pie I wish i had gone with that one! When Dom took one of the square pies from the oven the oil would hit the hot pan and fill the place up with smoke! Once your eyes got used to the tearing and irritation it actually becomes part of the charm. the pie we had was with porcini mushroom mozzerella and a drizzle of olive oil and snipped fresh basil at the end.Oh so good! My friend and I ate it like it was an appetizer and surely could have polished off another. It's a small place but the hustle and bustle is key. On ave J in a very small corner you roll in tell his daugter what you want, she writes it in a notebook and calls your name when the pie is ready. I didnt see anyone but Dom make, bake, and cut the pizza himself! There is a wait even if you order and the place isnt too busy I think he likes to make the pies one at a time. but the ambience of a time lost and the people that gather there will keep you occupied until the round plate of deliciousness is in front of you waiting to be devoured!Great place  the walls are adorned with plaques and articles it doesnt get any better!

1795,Rob D.,0.0,5,"I haven't had a better traditional slice of pizza ever.Domenico imports all his ingredients from Italy, so everything is super fresh. Watching him make a pizza is like watching Mr. Miyagi doing Karate. His attention to detail is highly impressive. Dom doesn't stick to a strict recipe, he does everything by ""feeling and seeing"" the pizza. Anyhow, I ordered a square slice with pepperoni and a cheese pie. I'm glad I was able to try both, as they were both different and delicious. The square pie was cooked perfectly with fresh basil on top, and what I really loved most was how you could taste the olive oil in the crust. The cheese pie was to die for with every bite tasting better than the last. Everything is perfect, the crust, the taste of the cheese, the amazing basil that he cuts up personally, and the sauce. I read a lot of reviews stating that the slice is too messy. Well, as any experienced pizza eater would know, you need to let the slice rest for a little, and settle especially at the 900-1000 degree farenheit that Dom cooks the pies at. It's tough letting the pie settle but in the end its worth it. Also, the slice is a little greasy and oily which I actually really liked.I got there around 645pm, and the last order was taken at about 715pm - yep, they sold out hours before they close, so get there early and be prepared to wait. If you order a pie it will take longer than just a few slices so keep that in mind. My pie took about an hour and 45 minutes to make, so I would suggest going in there placing your order and then take a stroll around the area, but honestly watching him work killed time pretty easily (until I was famished.) Not only is this place an experience, but as a native New Yorker I can say this is the best slice in town.",4/24/2015,19,14,0,0Zl2-7ymuPv58dMhcwsDCA
1796,Eric G.,0.0,5,"This isn't a pizza place, it's a monument, a Sistine Chapel that is painted and scrubbed clean every morning. (Health rating, solid B) Watching Dominic cover your steaming pizza with freshly cut basil and slicing it unevenly with what seems like the last bit of strength left in his body is not just seeing a cook, it's seeing a craftsman. A sculptor in dough and painter in marinara.My advice for newcomers is simple. Come early, put your order in, enjoy the BYOB policy while you wait, slowly meander into a comfortable seat. Then prepare yourself for an experience unparalleled by any creation of man. Get a cheese pizza, because though all the ingredients are top notch, his style is best enjoyed with nothing getting in the way of the basil crunching on a bed of cheese and olive oil, slowly fusing, making each bite  a separate experience from the one before it. Then get another with all the toppings you want and enjoy that too.I once stayed till closing, nabbing the last pie of the day, when tragedy struck. I was told, a massive spill of olive oil landed in the oven, filling the whole place with smoke. They attentively cleaned it and begun fanning the smoke out the door but it was too much too soon. We sat there, devouring the pizza in a cloud of smoke that would have rendered Tommy Chong unconscious, My eyes watered, and for a moment, I couldn't tell if it was the smoke lapping at my tier ducts, or the pizza revitalizing my hope for mankind. For amongst all the war, bigotry and pollution in the world, one man is creating something that truly makes it a better place.A good place to contemplate the sensation of existing and the perfection of pizza.",9/1/2015,191,14,0,eQ2j44s_xqLsNve2yAFwkw

He mentioned that there is this old guy who's been making pizza for many, many years & he was ""HANDS-DOWN"" the best. My friend said his hands are so CALLOUSED from pizza-making but because he does it himself is what makes it very special. I showed up to Di Fara's at 5pm on a windy & chilly Thursday afternoon & had to wait outside. The store was closed & the sign at the store read - WILL RE-OPEN AT 6PM. Hung out at Dunkin Donuts for an hour & returned at 5:50pm. They didn't open the store until 6:20pm; ""Ok, so they told a little lie, but the pizza must be great if there was a line behind me in the freezing cold..."" I thought to myself. When they finally opened the door I thanked God. As I stepped in, I was still a little hesitant because I remember reading that the store was closed for unsanitary conditions including rats & the grade was still pending. AT 5$ A SLICE & 28$ A PIE....hmm got me questioning....My girlfriend ordered a sausage slice & absolutely LOVED IT. I ordered a garlic pie for 2$ more for a total of 30$ for the pie. When the pie came out the old guy that makes the pie chipped some garlic on top & I thought, ""Really?! that's what I paid 2$ extra for when I can do that myself?!"" His assistant cut the pie & ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED the entire dirty pizza cutter into the pie...OMG, i went ballistic in my mind but I was so hungry with the wait I didn't care. Then he brought out some basil leaves & UNIQUELY CUT IT WITH SCISSORS which was fascinating +_+As soon as I got home I had a slice & it was truly authentic & unique. The ROMAN, PARMESAN, & MOZZARELLA CHEESE COMBINATION WAS TASTY & SALTY, however HALF OF THE PIE WAS BURNED & we had to THROW AWAY about 3 slices because we couldn't eat it. The crust & the bottom of the pizza were inedible. Overall, I would rather have Artichokes or Grimaldi's Pizza. I'm guessing that my experience with Di Fara's was different than the usual since many people gave it 5*. I probably won't go back there after this.",1/26/2012,138,26,4,D58xwkCn8aqhS8WtGKiDVQ

1813,Larry G.,0.0,3,"I was in NYC this weekend visiting my daughters, one of which lives in Brooklyn.  After hearing so much about Di Fara Pizza, I decided to try it.   I will say that it was certainly worth the hour and a half wait, but I have to clarify that by saying it was worth it ONCE...........just for the experience of having partaken of the experience.   However, I would never do it again, because while the pizza is very good, I think there are better ones in and out of New York City.   I had ordered 3 slices, as well as 2 whole (round) pies.  The slices were very over done and excessively crispy.  The pies also had quite a bit more charred areas than I would consider acceptable.  While it seems this is the norm for Di Fara, I'm not sure how it has become so widely accepted.  Additionally, while I do like basil a degree, the pizza was overburdened with the quantity, and therefore was overpowered with it's taste.  I thought the cheese was quite good, and the crust had a nice flavor.........once you picked off the burnt part.Although many think it's so impressive watching the owner create one pie after another, I don't really get the whole essence of it.  I'm sure after this many years, he has come to blend the art and the science of making a consistently good pizza, but let's put this in perspective.   It's not such a skill that it couldn't be taught to a few dedicated apprentices eager to carry on the tradition.  The pizza building is so slow and meticulous that it fully explains why getting a pie takes an hour and a half.   I think that the making and baking could be done just as well with 3 or 4 ""assemblers"" and the production could therefore be tripled or quadrupled without sacrificing quality.  As much as I wanted to be part of this experience one time, I could not justify wasting another hour and a half waiting for a pizza to be crafted and cooked.  And, that doesn't even take into consideration the other 45 minutes I waited in line just to get to the window where I could give my order.Lastly, I was rather shell shocked at the price of the pizza. 29bucks for a pizza without any toppings at all???  Living in Baltimore, even the best of the pizza there can command about a little more than half of that.   It may not be quite as good, but there are some pizzas near me that I actually find the taste of to be better than Di Fara's.............mainly because they don't have burnt crust and overpowering basil.",7/27/2015,0,1,0,Bxx9Mfy7CK9MSuReHMRuLA

1819,Alexis C.,0.0,5,"I have died, and gone to PIZZA HEAVEN...I must say that I didn't wait all that long..about 15-20 minutes for a pie on a Thursday night. Seriously though, unlike any other NYC pizza experience I've ever had. After ordering my pie, I grabbed some modelo especial's at the supermarket across the street. No one seemed to mind I was enjoying a cocktail while I waited. This place is a dump.. seriously you would never expect something so delicious and amazing to come out of here. The interior hasn't changed a bit since the place opened god knows how long ago. All of that is superficial to the product, I was memorized watching the boiling cheesey goodness come out of the oven (check out the picture's I've included).There is one old Italian man that makes the pizza. They average about 20 pies and hour (I asked!). Keep in mind this place is only open for 3 hours in the evening - 6pm - 9pm! I guess when you charge $25 for a regular pie and $30 for a Sicilian you only need to do 3 hours of business a night...",12/4/2009,2,13,3,1YVk3zvhdq1CKd87Fmpkxw

I can only hope I can work like that in the 100 degree heat all day when I get to be that age.  I had to make the trek so I could eat the most highly rated and best pizza in America. The pizza was not that good.  The sauce didn't have much flavor, cheese was pretty tasteless, and the crust tasted like it had worked too long to me.  It was nice and crisp though, almost tough, and the fresh basil was a nice touch, but still very average.  Seems like places like this get this great status from the food network and other high profile reviews. I fell for the hype. It doesn't matter though, because there were so many tourists like me who made the trip, take the pictures and get on the band wagon.  I hear they are doing very well.  I must have been lucky because I went on a Tuesday afternoon and didn't have to wait at all.  You may just have to try it for yourself like I did.  The Q train drops you off on Avenue J and you can see DiFara's when you come down the subway stairs.  It is all about the pizza for me, but if your are expecting a nice clean looking place forget it.  There are a few old long fold-out tables, a cooler with Pepsi and a few old steel chairs.  It appears to me that it has not been spruced up since it first opened in 1964.",6/14/2017,0,41,0,Bcb27ZpZF5eGsCGITcXZFQ

1825,Matthew S.,0.0,4,"We stopped at Di Fara as part of our 4-part Brooklyn pizza tour.I will say, first off, that the pizza here is absolutely phenomenal. It's really some of the best I've ever had. The fresh basil and the olive oil added at the end make it just about perfect. We got a large regular cheese as well as a square pizza with peppers, onions and sausage. Both were awesome.Despite the incredible pizza, I can't give Di Fara 5 stars, unfortunately. It's really not convenient to anything, but you probably already know that if you're thinking about coming here. The line was actually quite short when we arrived, but it was deceptive. Once we ordered it took nearly an hour to get our pizzas, and it was brutally hot inside with hardly anywhere to sit. There also isn't much of anywhere nearby to hang out and wait (and I got the sense that if you leave they may not make your pizza at all!). It was also, by far, the most expensive stop on our tour.All in all, if you want some of the best pizza you will ever have, you need to stop into Di Fara at some point. Just know that it's going to be inconvenient, expensive and take a while. It's certainly worth doing for a special occasion, but not an every week kinda thing.",7/8/2012,5,22,0,9yvGmsjhH2ZgykkX6agPCg

Got there about 12:20 on a Sunday when they were supposed to open at 1. About 15 people on line in front of me. Opened at 1:40. Placed order at 1:50. Pizza came out around 3:10. Pie with sausage and pepperoni was about $35. Covered in olive oil and freshly cut basil and freshly grated parmesan it is definitely unlike pretty much any other pizza. Watching Dom do his thing I definitely get the hype, but not sure it justifies the over 3 hours in total I spent there. Definitely something to do once (maybe on a Tuesday in the summer) as the pizza is truly excellent and totally unique, but for me no meal is worth a 3 hour wait (standing the whole time).",12/23/2015,43,9,0,nemdMn78rrgtVuXU5da1-w
1831,Asuka N.,1.0,4,"After wanting to come here for a couple years, I finally took it upon myself to make the trek out to Brooklyn from Murray Hill (travel time, including transfers, ended up being almost 45 minutes one way). I first heard of Di Fara's from the New York Times article about their $5 slices. Luckily, I didn't encounter the wait that most people seem to have to endure. I arrived a few minutes before the 6 PM reopening, and there were only 2 people in front of me. Although we had to wait 10-15 minutes longer than expected before reopening, it wasn't too bad. Even when I went to order first, there weren't so many people behind me that all the tables were taken; I was still able to score myself a seat so I could sit down and properly enjoy the pizza right after it came out of the oven.Now, for the pizza itself: it's fantastic. I'm not sure I'd rate it higher than Grimaldi's, but the cheese was delicious (and slightly different from most other pizzas I've had). I also think some parmesan was sprinkled on top as well. I didn't get much basil, which was slightly disappointing, but that didn't detract from the quality much. I'm a big fan of the lumpy tomato sauce used; you get some of the actual tomatoes in the slices, which definitely adds some texture to the bite. The crust is a bit thicker than I prefer, but definitely not something that really took away from the flavor.So why the extra star off? Simply put, I don't think it's worth the $5 that each slice cost. It'd be one thing if the flavor was otherworldly good, or if the slices were as large as some of the Ray's joints in the City make them. It's definitely one of the best slices, but I don't think it justifies the price. And if I did have to endure the wait...well, Grimaldi's is plenty bad enough, but I don't know if I could have (or would have) done 1.5-2 hours in a cool fall evening waiting for a couple slices. It's fantastic, and I'll probably go back from time to time, but I doubt I'll make it a regular occurrence to travel that far for the pizza.",10/21/2010,377,1703,197,CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g
1832,Jenn C.,0.0,5,"It's a bitch to wait, it's expensive, it's not close by to anything else, it's unorganized, and there is zero ambience, but watching Dom make a pie is magical.  Someone else might grate the cheese, or bring him the dough, but he's the master and no one but the master will actually touch your pie.   And what a pie it is - we got a square pie, because Deanna W. told Lizz K. and I that it was something special, and it was. Just charred enough, thin crisp, and seasoned to perfection,  with tomato sauce tasting only of the brightest tomato, amazing cheese, and creamy, fresh cheese, with basil lovingly hand cut over the top. There is nothing that I could think of to improve this pizza, taste wise, and when it comes to pizza that's the most important thing. I also got a slice of a regular, round pie to go, and it was also pretty damn incredible, even reheated. Don't go hungry, as others have warned - we had almost no one in front of us and STILL had to wait an hour. I think that the round pies come out much faster than square pies do, since the square pies are double baked (to make them uber crispy, I guess). Also dont expect to be comfortable, as you will probably stand for a good long while, and even when you get a seat, it will be cramped and sort of dirty, and uncomfortable and hot. But honestly, once you eat, you won't care. You won't care that you paid $32 for pizza and sodas that arent very cold at all. You won't care that you almost punched someone in the face for chatting at a table after their pizza was done, or that someone took all of the free pickled hot peppers to eat with your pizza and didn't leave you any.

The wait from placing our order to actually being served the pizza was a solid, painstaking 2.5 hours.The first bite after the pizza came out of the oven, however,  made the whole day trip and 2.5 hour wait worth it. The crust was crispy, the cheese could be stretched an arms-length, and the in-house made pepperoni is the best I've ever had.My only reason for docking a star is that (1) they didn't give us double pepperoni and (2) the 2.5 hour wait was a bit excessive.

1840,Alison H.,0.0,5,"I find the greatest difficulty with being exposed to greatness is that you can no longer tolerate mediocrity following said exposure. My concern in schlepping out to Di Fara was not that it would fall in the mediocre bracket but that instead it would make my pizza eating elsewhere increasingly difficult. It's fair to say that is what in fact occurred.The restaurant front of Di Fara is unassuming and in no way indicative of what lies inside. If you were walking along the street, you would most likely continue to walk, never realizing the live art gallery you had just passed. Fortunately, I was with a veteran pizza eater who knew better. Bless you, Adam.I watched Dom work his magic for over an hour, and can I just say that I did not mind the wait? I definitely was dying to bite into one of the glorious-looking pies, but watching Dom was like watching Michelangelo sculpt using Carrara marble. Dom takes the resources of the earth and creates something unforgettable. His experienced fingers formed the dough, lovingly swirled olive oil, and tossed a ball's worth of freshly sliced mozzarella and Grana Padano on each canvas of dough. Literally, fresh sliced and grated for each pie. I marvelled that Dom put so much care and attention into each order. No vat of premade dough balls, sliced mozzarella, grated Grana Padano, or cut basil would do. Which is why I am more than happy to pay $25 for a plain pizza here. Not only is the quality amazing but the workmanship and artistry is all part of the value.My conclusion? Fantastic pizza. I don't even like whole tomatoes but I absolutely loved the roasted cherry tomatoes. They softly burst in my mouth with a savory wash of tomato juice and pulp. What put it over the top was the basil that unleashed its clean aromatic scent as it was snipped and tossed on a brown bubbling pizza. If you are in the New York City area, please go. You won't be sorry. And its much friendlier to the pocket than a trip to Naples when the craving hits.",8/10/2010,365,107,83,Edy5nn-wi-RM_8fPeai09g

It takes about 45 mins to an hour to get your pizza, we ordered 2 pies, one with cheese and one with mushrooms and garlic. Just as my stomach started eating my back, the pizza was ready. Pretty thin crust, half of which was charred on both pizzas. The cheese was good, not too much of it. The distinguishing characteristic of the pizza was the basil. It was cut fresh by a really old italian guy at the counter. The pizza was also a little too greasy, as if they poured olive oil over the top of it. Overall, I wouldn't make the trek out to Midwood just for this pizza, and they are about $30 a pop, and its not a comfortable place to enjoy your pizza.",12/17/2011,168,18,0,_DEHHWSzVKohZNfuYsWrTw

1851,Raymond L.,0.0,5,"If you are looking for the best pizza you can put in your mouth, Di Fara is the place to go. Getting off the Avenue J stop, it is situated on the corner with an old yet bold sign that reads PIZZA. Perhaps an even more telling sign that you have come to the right place is the crowd of people waiting outside what looks, to the untrained eye, like another run-down pizza establishment. Once inside, however, your pizza journey begins..Your first conquest is waiting in line. Expect at least a minimal wait in off hours and up to a substantial wait during peak hours. As your turn arrives, tell the nice lady what you would like to order. While there are a variety of toppings, combinations, and cuts, do not fret as they are all something to try. The prices are steep...$5 for a regular plain slice and $28 for a pie. That is a premium price but expect no less than a premium slice/pie. The lady will take your name and write down your order.Now comes your second and perhaps most challenging conquest, which is waiting for your food. This wait can last anywhere between 30-60 minutes. What you do as you watch others get their beautifully made pizzas is entirely up to you. Your favorite tunes and some companionship will help to ease this leg of the journey. Make sure you are around to hear your name being called. It will happen, and when it does, you can finally get to the best part.It is time to eat! But before you chow down, take a moment to take a look at what is front of you. In a paper plate is the best pizza New York has to offer. Nobody but Mr. DeMarco knows exactly what makes it so special. Is it the freshly cut basil that adds that extra flavor? Or perhaps the drizzle of olive oil in the sauce? Maybe it is that delicate sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. It could be all of these things. Whatever it is, it tastes darn good. Your first bites of the pizza melts every other thought away. The hour-long wait you just endured? Gone. The $5 you had to cough up per slice? Gone. You are left with thoughts of nothing but the finest combination of crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings running through your mouth. After finishing the pizza, however, some may have realized their journey has ended. One may find oneself to experience mild depression. This is of course until you realize that another $5 could buy you another 5 minutes in pizza heaven. Even the wait becomes more bearable when you learn of different ways to deal with it...playing games on your phone...reading a novel...writing a Yelp review for your favorite pizza restaurant.

By the time the pizza was ready my date and I had already determined the lack of chemistry/ability to understand each other's language. The actual slices were good. Oily and light.

1854,Mike W.,0.0,5,"Yeah, yeah...a slice will set you back five bucks and a cheese pie will cost you $25. But Di Fara's is leagues beyond your typical slice shop or take out pizza joint. When you walk in, there is no line, just a mob of people waiting to place an order. It's almost like a bar, with only the most assertive making their way to the counter. Forty minutes isn't too bad of a wait for pizza, if we had to wait two hours, I might've needed a beer. Make that an entire six pack. Coming into this place, you know the wait is gonna be long and sweaty. It's hot and there's one old man making pizza at his own place. But damn, just enjoy your time with friends and take in the sights, smells and actions in the joint.The pizza. Mmm. The pizza. That's what makes it all worth it. This isn't a pizza you order out for a drunken movie night chronicling the illustrious career of Steven Seagal. No, you sit and enjoy the shit outta every bite of this pizza. DiFara's pizza has the perfect marriage between the three main ingredients of bread, sauce and cheese.  The crust is appropriately thin, with excellent crisp and lots of slightly charred portions. Delicious, slightly salty cheese. Minimal grease. Sauce that isn't sweet and has the flavor of fresh tomato.Combining quality ingredients and perfect execution, DiFara's creates a pie at the highest level of the New York form. Sure, it's pricey, but every once and awhile it's nice to spend a few extra bucks for the extra quality.",7/10/2010,47,197,49,yaNUJo62LN2i3gBlb2c2zQ
1855,Timm T.,0.0,5,"Hey sports fans, I love ya!Ever had an experience that shakes your beliefs to the very core?  You know, something that challenges what you've believed your whole life?  Take me for example:  I've always thought that I was the indestructible world champion pizza eater.  Then I went to visit my aunt and uncle in Yankee Candle land, and we had pizza for dinner.  Great, right?  Well, actually no.  Why, because my uncle (21 years my senior) kicked my ass eating pizza.  Seriously.  I had barely finished slice #2, and UR was already on slice #5.  Unbelievable.  I was crushed (well, not enough to give up eating pizza), but crushed all the same.  I'm still in awe of my uncle.  He's the real Mr Pizza Man.Can't relate?  Well, what about when you learned that Santa Claus didn't make his own toys or ride around the entire world in 24 hours (sorry if you didn't know that before)?  Actually, I thought that was the case when I was about 10 or 11, when I started getting clothes instead of cool presents for Christmas.  But it wasn't till a couple of years ago that I found out for real.  Total bummer.So, why does all this matter?  Glad you asked.  I was on my annual pizza safari to New York, the pizza home of the universe, with my favorite cousin of all time Smokin' Hot Stephanie, Super Woman.  Ironically, SHS's father is Mr. Pizza Man.  So, back to the safari.  Blossom and I have crissed-crossed four of the five boroughs of the Big Apple in search of the best pizza in the universe.  We had a long held belief that the title of best pizza in the universe was at Totonno's on Neptune in Brooklyn.  Truthfully, it's been about 5 years since we were there, but still, nothing else has topped this long-held, bedrock belief, until now.I heard about this little place in Midwood Brooklyn from Big Jersey Hair, so Blossom and I hit the Q train to check it out.  So here's this great pizza place right in the middle of an orthodox jewish neighborhood.  Just a little hole in the wall with a couple of tables.  We didn't have to wait long, but without a doubt, whatever the wait, it's worth it.  This pizza is incredible .  Made by Dom DeMarco for like forever.  The story is that Dom is the only one who knows the secret recipe for the pizza, and it's been said that he's taking it to his grave with him.  In Italy, we call this Omerta, the code of Silence.Okay, the pizza:  just the right amount of crust, very tasty pizza sauce, and fresh ingredients.  How fresh?  He grows basil right in the window of his shop.We get the pep and black olive.  The little puff of smoke when he opens the over door means your pie is ready, almost.  When the pie comes out, he sprinkles the top with fresh grated grana padano (first cousin to parmigiano reggiano).  Then he cuts up fresh basil and puts it on top the the grana padano.  Then he lightly sprinkles EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) over the entire pie.  You cannot believe how great it tastes, from the first bite to the last slice.  The fresh basil brings out the light taste of the EVOO, and everything is complemented by the pizza sauce, which is not too tangy, just right.I'm frickin dreaming about this pizza.  Me and Blossom have been debating this for the past 24 hours.  We're having a hard time wrapping our arms around the possibility that DiFara's is better than Totonno's.But it may just be.  I give it my highest rating, five basil plants.  Plus, Mr. DeMarco invited me behind the counter to take a picture of him and I in front of the ovens.",2/6/2010,19,41,5,zVbOwXiHKOKOGHkt66yIAA

There is a pizza shop on every corner and 9 out of 10 of them serve at least a decent slice, with most serving a delicious slice.So why would you need to travel all the way to Midwood to wait an hour for a $6 pepperoni slice? The pizza would have to be orgasmic to justify that, no?Well, it's not. It is good but it's not CRAZY good. The basil and olive oil are a very nice touch, but the crust is usually charred and the toppings are scarce. Honestly, if the lines weren't long and chaotic, and if the prices weren't so insane, I would be impressed by the use of quality, fresh ingredients. I might even go on a regular basis. Yes, it's good pizza. Yes, it's one of the better pizzas in the city. But it's not worthy of the hype and the wait and the money.To top it off, it routinely gets shut down by the health department.

But perhaps you will review my ""Pizza List"" then you'll be better aquatinted w the fact that I confidently know a good pie when I have one.Typically, the style of my reviews are on the whole pie (double antandra) addressing each componant which makes up the eating exsperience. Not just the food ""thing"" itself. So.....Its a very good pizza. & God I would hope so for $30 a pie or $5 a slice.Fresh dough. Excellent quality  mozzarella. The saucy tomatoes had beautiful tangy flavor. The Basil was bright w a bit of citrus. The char and crunch was varied in spots. Artists w their hands in the paint as it were, creating edible (unpretentious) art. Yet, the hours are unpredictable (which completely sux when it's a sweltering 100 degrees & you've driven 1.5 hrs just to seek this gem out) & then your ""greeted"" by a dirty hand written cardboard sign attached to rope saying @ 4:00 that they are closed & will reopen at 7 when they say they are open til 4:30. They were slightly merciful, let my husband in, order & we ate it on the hood of the car.The establishment itself is antiquated w little or no attention to its cleanlines,  the refrigeration cant keep up w the beverage demand when its hotter than Hades in there so your drinks are luke warm at best, the staff impersonal, intimate seating is being gracious.Is this joint a so called cliched authentic pizza experience?

The cooking is consistently excellent, not showy or overly trendy, just really solid good ingredients very well executed. The staff is without fail knowledgeable, helpful but never helicopters. For what you get the bill is reasonable.The one potential negative is that Rosewater is either intimate and cosy or too tight and crowded depending on your point of view.

1866,Justin L.,1.0,5,"After going to Di Fara's, I can understand where it gets its reputation from.  I'm originally from right by here actually, and back in the day Di Fara's was nothing special.  When I say this I mean no disrespect to Dom DeMarco, but the main reason its so popular is that it's one of the last of the great Brooklyn pizzerias that used to dot every other corner.  That era is gone, but he is one of the few that can still make pizza of that type and quality.  Not surprisingly, by upgrading his ingredients from the old days, he now has the best pizza in the city.  If you don't want to wait in line, don't come.  If you don't have the time to wait for your pie, don't come.  If you can't navigate the ordering process (not exactly rocket science), don't come.  If you're a hipster, don't come.  If you can't stand eating in a less than clean place, don't come.  If you can't tell Dom to skip the extra olive oil at the end, then don't come.  If you read all of the stuff about this place and see things like this that make you think you might not like it, then don't come.  Makes the line shorter for the rest of us and saves you a trip to eastern Brooklyn.  All of that said, this trashes nearly every other pizza in the city.  I've had nearly all of the of-the-moment pies listed in a few publications recently--Keste, Motorino, etc.--and Di Fara's blows them out of the water.  Those places lose themselves in their own hype and in trying to live up to some imaginary ""Neapolitan pizza"" ideal.  The ultimate thing that makes a pizza the best is how it tastes.  That is where Di Fara's excels.  The 3-cheese combo of mozzarella, mozzarella di bufala, and parmesean is the best in the city.  The sauce is perfectly flavorful and spiced, and balances well with the cheese.  The crust is thin and delicious, with a nice amount of char and smokiness.  The pepperoni was among the best I've had (seriously).  The basil is nice and flavorful...writing this review makes me want to go there now.  Its that perfect, and it lives up to the hype.  I've never had a bad pie here, but I will respond to a few complaints here.  One, he does use too much olive oil sometimes, but you need to watching always for your pie and then just tell him to only put a little bit on.  He does burn the crust a little bit too much sometimes, but in my experience its never been to an barely edible level.  If he did, hey this is Brooklyn: bring it to his attention, and if he doesn't want to rectify it, walk out.  In regards to the freshness, he gets deliveries every few days, other than that I could care less if they're 'fresh from the garden' or not.  One problem I have is the BYOB policy.  Its nice that they have this, but some people get absolutely trashed in there and its ridiculous.  Don't be one of those people.  Will this be the best pizza in NY for years to come?  I don't know, there are some pizzerias creeping up on Di Fara's in quality and Mr. DeMarco isn't immortal.  But for now, Dom DeMarco is unequaled.",8/2/2009,900,1007,34,HJdFNtGwRUpDI6KvorA4cw
1867,Lydell A.,0.0,4,"Let me start off by saying this is 5 star pizza!!  It won't and cannot disappoint as far as quality.  The pizza is here is among some of the best that I've had anywhere, and I've had a lot of pizza. Domenico is slow and consistent and cranks out gorgeous pizzas. Everyone it's own masterpiece; making you that much hungrier as you wait and watch him work.  I took one star off the rating because I was severely misled on wait time for a few slices. I was told 40 minutes for 4 slices (2 square and 2 triangle) but waited over and hour and a half. This was NOT on an extremely busy day. So I have to take one star off for that. If Domenico's daughter had told me 90 minutes from the beginning I would've planned for it better. The whole pie wait was 2hrs so I would've been much better off going that route. What I learned was this: always order a whole pie. And the square pie (which is baked twice) is much better than the regular pie and worth the $4 extra. If you don't want to wait 2hrs+ and pay $32 for a pizza, even though it is worth it, get a couple of plain slices of triangle pizza. You can get a plain slice in 5-10 minutes if you're lucky. If you want toppings then your wait goes up drastically. All in all, I'm glad I went but probably won't go back. I've experienced a Di Fara pie and I'm happy with that. I like my pies at Sally's Apizza in New Haven almost evenly and without the epic lines. It is a must try though.",3/16/2014,103,114,505,l1CNyLLRfUFOPfuxtonReQ

Fresh artichoke hearts sautéed in olive oil how could that be bad?  Also while I usually prefer the Neapolitan style he makes the best Sicilian pizza which is not too thick.  I get both. Also just relax it's a true hole in the wall and hot at that, but it's so worth the wait. Think about the end product and give him a break if the pizza is not perfectly round or cut equally...the tastes are beyond compare.

This was probably the greasiest pizza I've ever had in my life, and I do not intend to say that as a positive point. The greasiness was nauseating and I had to wick off a lot of it to make the pizza edible. Once the grease was mostly absorbed though, the crust was very thin and crunchy, and the cheese, tomato sauce and fresh basil were delicious. If it weren't for the pools of olive oil on top, it would have been the perfect slice.Admittedly, the pizza was pretty good, but I don't think the trip was worth the interminable wait. Given the historic value of this pizzeria, I would say that maybe its worth one trip when it's rainy and you really don't have anything else to do.

1876,Atif I.,1.0,5,"The Mark W. Diaries: Part Deux --- Jan 22, 2007My name is Mark, and today was a big day for me... I finally got a date. Woohoo! After I had failed miserably to attract anyone from yelp, I turned to Craigslist... and it worked! Yaay! I got one response to my 17th ad and quickly fixed up a dinner date... I searched for a good place to take my date. Yelp reviewed this pizzeria called Di Fara highly --- that settled it. I would take my date, Holly, to Di Fara.I thought I'd watch something funny on TV, that I could repeat to her. So I got a DVD of the British comedy from my thirty something years, ""Some Mothers Do Have Them"". My, she will really think of me as clever now. After spending six hours watching that, I decided that I needed to get off my ass and start walking to Di Fara. After all, it was only three hours of walking time from home.As I make my way over the Brooklyn Bridge I hope that Holly's a hottie. But, I decide to lower my expectations --- I'll settle for a pulse.  I calm my nerves and roll up the good stuff. As I approach Di Fara I see a long line outside. Not good, I think to myself. These people probably don't have home delivery. Why else would there be a line? Why? Huh? I reach Di Fara and Holly recognizes me from the red rose I have tucked inside my shirt (clever ploy from the black and white movies...heh heh). She leans forward to greet me and I try to check her out... ""Nice, Nice"". Sorry, she asks me. Oh, I was saying the place seems nice. We decide to wait in line together. I think: not good. This girl is very inconsiderate. Shouldn't she have gotten in line before me to save me waiting time? The line is moving slowly. I finally get to see the famous guy who owns this place, Dom. Man, this guy is really old! Shouldn't he be put away in some island for the old, and not allowed to mingle with the rest of the society? I hope that he doesn't conk off before serving me pizza. Man, I hate this ""discrimination against the elderly"" law. Idiot lawmakers, it should be the other way around. I must petition to change it.Even though I am hungry, I try to listen to what Holly is chattering about. She seems excited about this guy, Dom, she is! How meticulous he is with the dough, how accomplished and brilliant he is ...ooh genius. I tune out. Blah Blah Blah Blah. I think about the Taco Bell dinner I could have been having. Now that is real food. Since Holly had told me that she was a foodie, I decide to impress her with my own knowledge.You know, I tell her, I think this old geezer should hire young people from Taco Bell. That way he'd be fast with the order. You know, if we were at Taco Bell, we would have been done with dinner and be home making out by now. I can't tell from Holly's expression what she thinks of my idea. Either she is dumb-struck by my genius or she is just plain dumb.I decide to continue: see that young dude who is standing next to the old geezer..he should be doing more work. Now, that's efficiency. Why does the old geezer need to customize my pie for me? I don't care if it is done by him or by that young dude. What's the difference? After all, the High School kids at Taco Bell do a great job no matter who is serving!I think Holly is upset now. She says angrily: but Dom is a master. He is using his experience to delight the customers with an incredibly tasty and delicious pizza. His movements may be slow and deliberate, but it's an experience - look at his craftsmanship: stretching the dough, dressing it with the sauce made from fresh San Marzano tomatoes, carving the slices of mozzarella over the pie, placing it on a wooden paddle and then in the oven, later pulling it out with his bare hands. Drizzling olive oil and sprinkling herbs over it. The pizza is a perfect balance of textures and flavors. It is a piece of art! I say nothing, but think: whiny woman! Still, I say to myself: Patience, man...eye on the prize!As our turn comes to be seated, I mention that we want take-out. I turn to see that Holly is about to have a heart attack! She is shaking uncontrollably. After a few seconds she says: This artist is creating a work of pure genius and you want take out? A work of art that should be enjoyed straight from the oven and you want: Take-out? You Philistine!I see a number of eyes looking in our direction. I stammer nervously: but I thought you wanted to make out. So, wouldn't it be better to take-out? (nice, poetic touch.. heh heh)Hearing this, she storms out. I take the pizza home with me. Who cares? She's the loser, I now have the whole pizza to myself. I take a bite. Hmmm, this pizza is really tasty. That old geezer must know a thing or two. Next time, I will ask my neighborhood Taco Bell dude why an old geezer can make better stuff than him. Yum, this stuff is very good. It's giving me a high. I don't think I need to smoke the other stuff today. Yummm(Inspired from a ""True"" review and reposted at the request of yelper",9/14/2007,178,642,1789,cD_hpkvErXCyQHBQzv8KYQ

I am one of the few willing to admit that I've played the fool for Di Fara. There are many things in New York worth waiting for: breakfast at Shopsin's, a burger at Shake Shack, pancakes at Clinton St... but the semi-decent pizza Di Fara is not one.The walls of this scuzzy establishment are covered with ego-stroking praise, red herrings to distract you as you die a little while waiting for your pizza. Every time a square pizza comes out of the smoking oven people run out the door wiping the tears from their soot stinged eyes. The ordering system for a pie is pretty clear; the daughter writes your name and order on a notepad and you wait. The ordering system for slices is bewildering. After ordering my 4 slices--which she did not write down on her notepad--I inquired 45 minutes later just to make sure there was nothing else I had to do. ""Nope!"" she said ""It's fine. The next pizza coming out is for slices.""Cool right?! And then she gave my slices away to some cute douchey college boys who just walked in and flirted with her! Without a ""sorry"" she tells me I have to wait for the next pie. So I sulk back to my seat to wait, watching her smile and giggle with boys way too young. To make my wait ""better"", a huge crowd of college freshmen commandeered the table next to me and theatrically belted their class schedules to each other. Apparently Game Theory is a hot class this semester and their friend is never going to get into Brown...at least according to the McLOVIN wantabe.1 hour and 45 minutes later I pounce on the next ""for slices"" pizza coming out of the oven and finally finally FINALLY bring my pizza bounty to my table yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0… With rabid blood and endorphins throbbing through me, I lift the limpy-crusted slice to my mouth and am immediately drenched in a waterfall of oil. Disheartened, I fish for the cheese and basil in the olive oil lake of my plate and drag them back onto the crust. The cheese is overly salty and the sauce is chunky tomato juice begging to be sweetened! Even the fresh basil (which is definitely NOT grown in the window) lacks the punchy aromatic zest expected. This is unquestionably NOT THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK! Or as one of my friends say ""throw some fresh basil on a Domino's pie and it's almost as good... and they deliver in 30 minutes!""EPILOGUE: I forgot all about the worst part of the night! As we were leaving a guy who had waited so patiently for his dear pie was walking towards the door and SPLAT!!! 2 hours of his life lays face down on the filthy floor mat. Tears welled up in the eyes of all who saw; but he put the pizza back in the box and walked away with it. Everyone agreed, we would have done the same.",6/13/2009,233,403,834,XIZ93IR3Yrj2GDlhs_Wf8A

1879,Ting S.,0.0,5,"The pizza of my dreams. I tried time and time again for about two years to come to this famed institution, and each time, the line was out the door (i refuse to wait), and/or there was no parking in the area. Finally, on a brilliant Sunday afternoon soon after the 1pm opening time, I made it. I was thrilled there were only about 3 people in line. After ordering, it soon sank in that EACH pie was handmade, and made to order, so even though it was only a 5-minute wait to order, it was probably about 45 minutes until the pie was ready. Dom, the pizza master, methodically makes each pie, deliberately stretching the dough and lovingly dressing it with a ladle of the most fantastically flavorful sauce, shaving thick slices of fresh mozz from high quality balls of mozz, and giving each pie a sprinkling of freshly grated romano and a drizzle of high quality olive oil before easing it into the oven. When the pie is ready, he TAKES THE PIE OUT WITH BARE HANDS, gives it another palmful of freshly grated romano and drizzle of olive oil, and then cuts fresh basil onto the pie. Voila. The pizza of my dreams. From one perfectionist to another, I totally respect that Dom personally makes each pie, bringing quality control to a whole new level. He doesn't skimp on using only the finest ingredients, and his efforts are immediately evident. Even the crust was delicious! I was worried my expectations had risen too high, but in actuality, this pizza exceeded everything I could have imagined tasting in a pizza.$5 for a slice. $28 for a regular pie, $32 for a sicillian. The slices are modestly sized, and you'll want more than one. Gotta get a whole pie!",9/25/2011,337,420,89,M1wl9tWFaDbpfSxh5KmjaQ

We walked in and ordered a half porcini-mushroom cheese pie.  The next twenty minutes were spent watching Mr. Demarco meticulously prepare our pizza from the initial sprinkling of the cheese to its final christening with olive oil Now, I have to admit that after eating my first piece, I began to doubt Di Fara's reputation -- having spent a week last year in Italy eating pizza almost everyday for lunch as well as taking a local pilgrimage to Grimaldi's, my pizza standards were pretty high.   It was definitely good, but not the level of awesomeness i was expecting.Meanwhile, my boyfriend sat across the table in pure pizza ecstasy. Was my palate off? Were my standards unreasonable?  I reached for second piece and suddenly my doubt was erased and I joined my boyfriend in pizza heaven.How could two slices of the same pizza taste so vastly different?  In my eyes, Mr. DeMarco is the Jackson Pollack of pizza. Some areas of his canvas get pools of olive oil, some get a sprinkle. Some get  an extra slice basil, while others are left wanting more.  While I am firm believer that you can never have too much olive oil, cheese or basil.....

She talked it up for days and I was concerned that I'd be disappointed because of all the hype leading up to the meal. As stated in all the other reviews, the place is a hole in the wall. Rather dumpy to be honest. But the pie did not disappoint. It was delicious. Fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients. Hand made dough. Hand grated fresh mozzarella and parmesan. Chunky tomato sauce and topped with fresh cut basil. The master behind the pizza, Dom, made every pizza himself from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you're ever in Brooklyn. I'd highly recommend topping the pizza with the fresh red peppers (not the dried flakes, but red pepper soaked in olive oil).

1884,Valery C.,1.0,4,"I'll say upfront that I don't think Di Fara lives up to the hype. What makes this place special is that pizza-making here is the work of a single man, Domenico DeMarco, and you get to watch this artisan at work. He makes each pie methodically, deliberately, and unruffled by the crowds at the counter.  The pies go in and out of the oven with his bare hands.  The pizza I had was definitely delicious and reflected the high quality ingredients used.  So why the reservation?  No matter how good it was, it was not worth the near 1.5 hour wait.  The wait can vary (although its usually pretty long) but I just didn't love it enough to chance that again, when there are decent pizzas to be had all over NYC.  I know, not THIS pizza, but I'll pass.  Still, every pizza fan should come here at least once for the experience.  As many pizza places as NYC has, Di Fara is unique.  Place itself is unremarkable, but you don't come for anything other than watching Mr. DeMarco work and eating his handiwork.  Expensive, but you can probably tell why.",12/25/2009,56,847,9931,7SmEWHH-f7tYmRAwEBSceA

I mean it's ok and I will eat it but it's not the passion that some Yelpers have for it and argue points over it. Just not my fave dish.  So that being said I wanted to try the famous Difara's simply because it's a NY legend. Now I have tried the hyped pizzas of Grimaldis and Totonnos and hated them. I cant stand that burnt bottom taste. To me I would eat a slice of freaking Papa John over those gourmet crap pies that Yelpers do cartwheels over. So that being said I didnt expect much from Di Fara as me and a coworker set out across Brooklyn on a weekday late afternoon. I guess this is the time to come because on a wednsday at 3pm there wasnt many people and we waited about 15 minutes or so. The whole time my buddy was griping ""oh I cant believe we have to wait, this is bull I can go to that pizza place on the corner and get a slice in a minute"" this went on the entire wait as we watched Dom, oblivious to the people around him make his pies. Putting his hands right in the hot oven, cutting the fresh basil, shaving the Parmesan, drizzling the olive oil.  One thing I love is food ceremony, craft.This is why I love Japanese food so much, the artistry of it and Dom is an artist.   So we get 2 slices each. My complaining friend takes a bite, pauses, swallows, looks at me and says ""you know what...this is effing good pizza"". He literally ate his words and we both ate the slices pretty fast. I loved it as it wasnt all burnt and tasted so fresh, i love basil (grow my own) and olive oil so this made it taste far better than any other slice I had before.    A year later and I sadly have not returned because it's in freaking Midwood and I wont travel that far for Pizza, Any pizza but alas  the memory remains...",7/31/2013,299,365,906,sGJXg-dzsGSnstkDI5Nb1A

Located right next to the Ave J train station, Q train. Part of the experience is WATCHING him make pizza - he's been doing it for 43 years. You can see his picture of his glory days hanging by the oven. 2)Everything is pure ORIGINAL - his sauce is homemade with tomatoes from his town in Italy. The SAUCE is WONDERFUL(people were murmuring ""the sauce, the sauce"" in ecstasy when they were eating)His extra virgin olive oil is marvelous! His cheese is beautiful, and he chunks it onto the pre-pizza. The flour is nice and crispy, it's perfect. The crust is such an experience because it ranges from soft to crispy to burnt. His ingredients are all FRESH and natural - the sausages were cut right in front of us. WOWSOME TIPS ABOUT EATING AT DI FARA PIZZERIA1)Come when it opens or you will be waiting for a HOUR for your pizza -even SLICES can take up to 45 minutes. Just order a PIE. (Check the prices in the picture section) *****DON'T BOTHER TO CALL DURING BUSY TIMES - THEY WILL NOT PICK UP THE PHONE(I was personally there on a friday afternoon - they were so busy, the phones kept ringing but noone picked up the phone....so good luck)2)It's a SMALL place. Be prepared to get cramped. The seating section is very small too.3)If you are GERM A PHOBIC, stay away. He uses hands only, collects cash with the same hands too.

Better go in the summer so your wait outside isn't as bad. Finally the place looks like a cesspool inside and out. Not worth it. Don't think that this is the best Brooklyn or NYC has to offer.

But NOPE, he still sold those pies to some poor people. He drizzles HELLA olive oil and scissors basil on top of each pie. Each slice is different in that it could be soaking in olive oil and/or you may have a little piece of basil. This inconsistency sucks. I was praying my slice wouldn't be burnt but a part of it was. The areas that wasn't burnt was great but not the burnt areas. The crust was crunchy and had the perfect amount of ingredients. Was it memorable? Somewhat. Sorry, Dom, but I won't be returning to your pizzeria. I can see why you got closed down from the Health Department for several days. The restaurant and their aprons are a filthy mess.

Since it was an open kitchen, I was able to observe the whole pizza making process.  Long story short, Dom put three different types of cheeses and a ton (I mean, tons!) of olive oil on the pizzas.  Oh my goodness!!!!!  No secret, just tons of cheese and oil!!  Here is the review.      Thin crust pie - 8 slices, very oily but not greasy, nice crunchy crust with basil on top, very light and delicious.   Regular crust pie - 12 slices, again oily but not too greasy, much more cheesier and richer with basil, very very satisfying.Don't forget to put some chili pepper on the pizza, it definitely added a kick to the flavor!  Personally I preferred the thin crust over the regular one, because it was not as heavy and I could probably have eaten a lot more slices, haha.  The other person behind the counter (Dom's daughter?) was also very friendly.  I was screaming and taking loads of pictures of Dom and she just smiled.  They also let me use their employee toilet room.Basically, you haven't lived if you haven't had Di Fara Pizza!",5/22/2010,83,84,17,J0Ekjw375f5cGePXiRO1dg

They were tasty, but really salty. I appreciated the authentic looking guy making the pies and putting them in the oven. I appreciated the old-timey feel of the restaurant. I was lucky enough to go when there was not a huge line. But is this pizza worth paying $30 for a plain pie, or $5 for a slice? Quite simply, no. The slice was super oily and super salty. Tasty, but not worth more than 2 stars.",8/21/2013,66,82,5,mavs0rOqBTekriMgHeXxwQ
1913,Liz V.,0.0,5,"Delicious pizza. Let's just say, for the five star experience, you need to do a bit of planning.1. Drive, if you can, because seating inside is very limited and there aren't any parks or benches around. If the weather is bad, at least you can enjoy the pizza in your car. You may have to do that anyway, since parking is very difficult in the neighborhood.2. Don't go to Di Fara hungry. You will wait at least an hour, possibly over 2. I have a vague memory of someone once telling me you could call ahead- I've never done that, so don't bet your life on it. If you go during non-sabbath times, you can get some standard poppy seed hamantaschen from the Jewish bakery across the street for a little appetizer. You can also peruse the dollar store while you wait. 3. Try to time your hunger so that when you do eventually get your pizza, you can eat a lot of it. It is so effing delicious. I always order a whole pie (or several depending on how many I'm dining with). One pie is good for two people who've been waiting a year for this pizza.  I never get toppings because I'm like that, but one time I saw a single guy order the special pizza, a sicilian with a bunch of tasty looking toppings, and I was ggggrrrreeeeennnn. So maybe one day, I will order the special. I have never ordered by the slice.",12/18/2013,4,25,0,L3-sRn-Hr3qDLd_vMY9yQA
1914,Karen Y.,0.0,5,"There are plenty of raving reviews about Di Fara and I'm just adding another to the list. I was only in NYC for a long weekend...this was one of my must-tries and I'm so glad we came for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon since it wasn't too crowded.It's a local spot in Brooklyn and to me, it was the epitome of what a true pizzeria should be. Small and rundown space, several pizza ovens in an open kitchen, one person taking orders, and of course the owner Dom making every single pizza himself! Apparently, he's been doing this for the past 40 years or something so I truly admire him. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…)We waited around 45 min for food but it was well worth it, although the wait is known to be even longer. This sign says it all. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) You can either get pizza by the slice ($4 or $5 with toppings) or a whole one (ranging from $20-$33 depending on toppings). My bf and I were starving so we thought it would be more bang for our buck with getting the entire pie.Patiently waiting while Dom drizzled more olive oil, sprinkled some freshly grated cheese, and cut up basil onto our pizza. It was like watching a master of a craft perfect his piece of work. (yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…) He was amazing and never rushed anyone's pizza. We ordered one with pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives ($25)...it came out of the oven and was ginormous!It was definitely the oiliest pizza I have ever had but it was so incredibly tasty that we didn't care or even bothered to sop up the grease (aka Dom's love) with our napkins. I was all set with my parsley and chili flakes too...YUM! OMG I was in pizza heaven!! Now I feel like I can't have NY-style pizza anywhere else. It was pretty thin in the middle so that the toppings slid off a bit but that's what the plates and utensils were for. =)The ingredients he used were all fresh and delicious...I loved how he used whole tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce too. I was ridiculously full after 3 huge slices but couldn't help eating the crust too... it was just crispy and doughy enough at the same time for me to want to savor every last bite. Reading all the articles and newspaper clippings on the walls about this historic pizzeria during our meal was entertaining as well.The destruction of our pie in photos:Before: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…During: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…After: yelp.com/biz_photos/C8j0…Yes, the two of us ate that entire pizza by ourselves! *hides in shame* It really lived up to the hype...the food as well as the Di Fara experience!Cash only of course and you pay after you get your food. There are regular or square pies too (I noticed the latter was more of a deep-dish pizza). Come on a rainy day like us so the wait won't be as long!",5/16/2009,465,235,364,vxiiHJdy3GZ7DWhhA4ukaQ

It is an exact replica of the kind they make in Napoli, which is where I had the best pizza I've ever had in life. I think the reason they are so particular about taking their time to make it is because they have it down to a science...it's an old world technique that somebody's grandfather or maybe even further back than that brought over here from Italy. It's beautiful that they are still doing it that way today, and even more beautiful that so many people appreciate their slow, dedicated technique and old skool vibe. I went in there with two friends who live on Avenue H last weekend, and we waited an hour for a pie....no joke. But I was prepared (heard weekends are the longest).....they say that good things come to those who wait. It was the best pizza ever! The sauce was divine. I tasted the love. Also, Dom is the most adorable old guy ever. He is so cute when he is working. He approaches pizza like a craftsman carving a masterpiece. Part of the ambiance is watching him work. Your eyes will burn and sting from the soot from the coal oven though, so beware. You can BYOB, but the seating is sparse. The place def. hasn't changed in at least a decade if not two....I'd even believe 3. I love these mom-and-pop neighborhood relics that actually weather the storm of the many changes NYC goes through. It's hard to find places that have grit and character and quality and culture all at once anymore. P.S. check the picture of Dom hanging up when he was a young man making pizza there. He was sooo hot. His son who works there too, is a spitting image, but doesn't have that certain something that his father had.

I, thankfully, had access to a car so was able to avoid the long subway ride, and, encountered no wait when I arrived around 7 PM on  Sunday. From the other reviews, it seems like no wait is a rarity so maybe Sunday night is a safe bet. Di Fara may be a quintessential NY pizza pilgrimage.

1920,John C.,0.0,2,"As I take a sip of my haterade I begin to type.  I knew coming in this place was a dirty dive, that never adds to the ""charm"" for me but also doesn't bother me.  What surprised me is the shit show that is their ordering process.  No organized line, just a jumbled mess of people eating and waiting.  There was just two of us so ordering a pie was not an option.  Well if your ordering slices you can bend on over and let the anal raping begin.Although I can respect the ol man behind the counter for making pizzas for all these years, I did not find watching him at work to be the magical experience everyone else describes.  I was hungry and I found it painstakingly irritating.  He works at a snails pace.  Half the pies come out burnt.  The toppings are not evenly distributed and the pies are shaped like jigsaw puzzles.  I guess all details that add to the ""character"" of the pizza for all you retarts.  With just a few people in line, the wait for our $5 fuckin slices was close to an hour.  This wait time is self imposed and selfish.  Ill pluck out five senior citizens from a local nursing home, arm them with some fresh basil and scissors and let's get moving.Now even after all this, once I sat down with my slice I was excited.  Took my first bite and my honest reaction was to laugh and say ""that's it"". The slice was small.  That's what happen when you make amoeba shaped pies, there's no consistency.  The fresh grated cheese had no bite.  The one piece of fresh basil was lost in the puddle of pathmark olive oil.  The slice was bland, flavorless and left me angry.  Even the hot pepper oil couldn't push this piece of cardboard past average.  I am totally puzzled by the praise for this place but to each his own.",5/14/2011,25,109,3,0psBq7Xux6e430Nilu8vFQ

It's like a pizza from another planet, and a good planet (I thank u Steve Jobs)!You are a true artist Dom. The sauce, the cheese (3 or 4 kinds of those, including real bufala mozzarella and imported parmigiano reggiano), watching you pouring that olive oil before you send it to the oven where she is slowly, wondrously brought into being. You're putting all of that love into each pie, and taking your sweet time at that.. the lines are long at Di Faras but only cause Dom can stop time. Expect about 1-2 hours wait, and in the summer you don't want to wait inside since the place can get blazing hot and that shitty ceiling fan wont really help. I had a lot of pizza in New York, and there are some really good other spots (L&B Spumoni if u like sicilian, Lucali, John's in the village, Grimaldi's...) but I really think that Dom is the thin crust Leonardo Da Vinci of our time.

That's ok cause the two cheeses and olive oil goodness of the pizza is so delicious.

I think this makes the list with ""Artichoke"" and ""Roberta's"" that I would go out of my way to visit. The place it self is nothing special, it's a small ""around-the-corner"" pizza place that's dingy.  The pizza is a little pricey for the look of the place, it's $5 a slice now. $25 for a regular pie, $30 for a special. The line is also long. We were lucky enough to go during a week day so I would imagine how long it gets on the weekend.But it was all worth it. My friend describes it as ""pizza that is better than you'd get at most restaurants, so I put up with the grime feeling surroundings"", and I fully agree. We got the plain and special. The plain is the one to get. It helps you taste the sauce better which is on point, and he tops it off with a little parmesan cheese himself that adds a spike. I didn't think it was anything special till Mr. Di Fara himself spiked the pizza with the parmesan cheese, even the most jaded will feel a little impressed that this man is from a different era and knows how to do it right. That moment was when I just knew it would surpass Grimaldi's on my list. The pizza won't disappoint.Personally if I were this guy I would have retired long ago and really couldn't care any less if my pizza place declines in quality, but thank goodness that this guy still has his hands in the dough and adding his little touches that makes these pizza's truly special.",5/27/2010,95,534,26,13ZRy38pcYB9DX3LhYUXfw

That's called ART!None of this really bothered me. I'm serious. It's not like I'm dining at Michelin star restaurant. I get it.However, the moment I placed that pie in my mouth after leaving the pizza joint skipping and singing like a fool, I felt like what I was acting like... - a fool indeed.As I missed that orgasmic bite, I chewed and regurgitated (yuck), seeking for clues. The sweet, flavorful tomato sauce? Yeah, it's there. Fresh three cheese sucker punch? Yup, right on spot. Yet, it didn't all come together. It's good, but nothing heaven-like that would make me come back and spend another afternoon for Di Faraway pizza.I was puzzled even more today, after spending a day making homemade pizza with friends.

What if a hair gets on my slice?  I will seriously spazz out.  As my name was called, the area was clear and I made sure to look to the left and right of me as my pie came out and was being cut.  Parm cheese, basil and olive oil were added to my finished pie and of course, I had to have a slice on the drive home.  Di Fara's pizza is good, it is worth the $28, but watch then damn people leaning over the counter.

1958,George C.,0.0,4,"Why did the hipster burn his mouth on his DiFara slice?He ate it before it was cool.I arrived @ 3:01 on a Wednesday, satisfied that Don was behind the counter. I ordered my regular slice @ 3:05 (there was no line but they took their time asking for it) and was quoted a wait of a ""few minutes"". I anxiously waited as basil wafted through the hot air (98-degrees if the thermostat was correct), amazed when my name was called @ 3:07 and I forked over the five-spot, walking out @ 3:08 with a fresh-out-the-oven creation. As I walked through Midwood, treating the slice like any other that's designed for traversing a borough, I noticed a hint of fennel seed, but not much in the way of a pronounced flavor that set it apart from its contemporaries. For what it was, Di Fara is a slice of Brooklyn and a legitimately tasty product, but Dom seemed to personify the downward spiral of the place following escalating media exposure - too many people who wanna chew his ear off claiming they were there in the decades ago and that he should thus preferentially treat them and expedite their pie.Why a 4 and not a 5? The slice wasn't that spectacular. The same not-so-stellar slice cost $5. I potentially could've waited upwards of an hour for said slice.Why a 4 and not a 3? I didn't have to wait. It's in a not-so-hip area where you gotta respect the lines and the dedication, even if it can be mainly young people with time to kill who make a pilgrimage out of it.

1966,Barrett L.,0.0,3,"I got a tip about DiFara from a foodie friend of mine who has been raving about the amazing pizza.  After some deliberation, the BF and I decided that we would go forth and venture to the famed pizzeria.  After hiking down from Manhattan to this hole-in-the-wall joint on Avenue J, we realized how lucky we were that we had literally nothing else to do all day.  DiFara requires a serious time investment; the shop had only been open for 20 minutes and already we were facing about an hour wait for a pie.  Here's why: a disorganized line/wait system, dependent only on the non-owner and a legal pad, hordes of amateur foodie bloggers/hipsters/tourists snapping their cameras and asking too many questions, and an artisinal (read: archaic) way of making the pizzas.  As a side note, we ended up waiting half an hour longer for our pie because the guy taking the orders misheard my name and order and skipped over us because he didn't know what to do.  Luckily, I stepped in to right the wrong and after 90 heat-filled painstaking minutes, got my pizza.The menu is simple: pizzas come by the slice or in whole pies, either round or square.  A plain slice will cost you $5 while a plain pie goes for $28 (get the pie, it's a much better deal).  We ended up going for the DiFara classic pie, which is the best deal if you want toppings on your pizza ($32 round pie that comes with sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms).  There's also a list of toppings (both regular and premium) to choose from, but most people go for the plain or the special. To be fair to DiFara and to the process, the pies come with A LOT of TLC: the owner Dom hand-makes each one with plenty of extra virgin olive oil, hand-tossed dough, freshly grated cheese, and snips on heaps of basil to finish the pies.But truth be told (and I'm about to make enemies with hundreds of foodies out there), the pies are not worth the excruciating wait.  The pizza was very very good, but it wasn't, as many reviewers here and elsewhere claim, ""the best pizza ever"".  My crust was kind of burnt, the middle of the pie was soggy, and the intial bites were so hot it burnt my mouth. Granted, these are small gripes and on the whole, the pizza was definitely a cut above the standard NYC pie, but when you wait an hour and a half for a pizza pie, you should expect nothing but the best.  This was not the best.  Motorino makes an equally good (and in my opinion, better) pie and the wait time is far shorter.With that said, it's an experience that every New York pizza snob should go through at least once.  There is something special and unique about the pizza and the process.  But for everyone who sings their praises and thinks DiFara is the greatest thing to happen to pizza, you don't need to wait a lifetime for great food.  There are other pizzas in this city that are just as good (and arguably better) that can be brought to your hungry stomach much more quickly than DiFara.But I'll say one thing that the reviewers here will likely agree with me on: DiFara kicks the absolute shit out of that tourist hole known as Grimaldi's.",8/7/2011,839,287,0,NqZJMXmwEtirJvx-qpyLmQ

1974,Michael U.,0.0,4,"I'd found out we would be presenting at The 2nd World Congress on Interventional Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes in New York much later than I would have preferred.  Don't get me wrong, being selected to present at the Congress was an honor and it is not that I don't love New York - but the fact of the matter was that I'd just been there the month prior and I was due to fly to Paris a mere 10 days after the Congress.  Add in the fact that I'd had zero days off since my last trip due to working plenty of overtime to help offset some of the upcoming travel bills AND that this issue had me flying into New York after an overnight shift...eh, who am I kidding - sleep or no sleep I love to eat, I love New York and its people, and I love pizza - a confluence of interests that led to myself and three locals to meeting up for a Tour of some of Brooklyn's (and America's) most highly regarded Pizza spots.With Steve 2 (as opposed to Steve 1) graciously offering to pick me up from LGA and Steve 1 (as opposed to Steve 2) graciously willing to do the leg work on getting to our first stop early to order the pie the ""hop"" would begin around 1:30pm at DiFara - a spot considered by many to be the best Pizza in America and often with an hour-plus line befitting such distinction - something I'd prefer avoid at any time, but particularly on my 34th sleepless hour save for a quick nap on the plane - thankfully luck was on our side and the drive went quickly, free parking was easily found, and by the time we arrived the pizza was in the oven.With pleasantries exchanged and promises of the fourth member of our group, Laura, arriving shortly the next ten or so minutes were spent talking about the history of the space, Dom's meticulous methods, and the neighborhood.  With news clippings as the small space's only decoration and Dom meticulously crafting each pie while his daughter and son worked the counter and back room the space was packed - not a seat to be had - and as such when our first pie was ready we opted to eat right at the counter.For our first taste of the day it would be a round pie - DiFara's signature - half plain and half with mushrooms and semi-sun-dried tomatoes.  While not truly ""Neapolitan"" given the style of the ancient oven and overall tender-yet-crisp chew to the crust, there is no doubt that the pie was the result of a serious craftsman working with serious ingredients.  With the dough barely capable of supporting the trio of cheeses, sweet tomatoes, herbs, and dousing of extra virgin olive oil let alone the toppings and hand snipped basil each slice was a steaming hot oozing mélange of flavor - some dark and bubbly, others less crisp and more chewy.  Preferring my pizza with a bit more rigidity I cannot say this was the best pie I've ever tasted, but I definitely understand the appeal and would certainly not hesitate to return.With our fourth adventurer arriving the next item to arrive from the oven was the Sicilian - an enormous pie with just the essentials - that marvelous blend of cheese, an ample coating of San Marzano tomatoes, a lacquer of olive oil, and that hand snipped basil.  An enormous pie - easily enough to feed four, this pizza was what I'd hoped for - it was perhaps the best ""thick"" slice of pizza I've ever encountered.  With a buttery crust not unlike that of a deep dish in the Windy City but far more textural and nuanced each slice stood up admirably to the bounty of ingredients without being ""too heavy"" - a delicate balance that few pizzas manage.  With myself eating three slices of the Sicilian and the others eating a slice or two each there was plenty to spare; thankfully it was boxed up and kept in Steve 2's car or I'd have surely eaten more.  Making our way from the small restaurant to our cars I remembered what a friend once told me about DiFara's and I can't say it any better myself - ""You don't go there just too eat Pizza - you go there to experience Pizza as an art form crafted by a master.""",4/4/2011,3126,4509,103643,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

1981,Jackie K.,0.0,4,"4.5 stars.There had been so much hype around this place and I've been wanting to try it for a while now, but had always been intimidated by the wait time.  Being that it was 3:45pm, I hadn't had lunch yet, and I happened to be working in the area, Di Fara Pizza was calling my name.I must have come at the perfect time, because I just had to wait 10 minutes for my slices of pizza.  They close for like an hour at 4pm, so even though more people came after me, they didn't quite make the cut.I guess the good thing about them being so busy all the time is that all your slices are super fresh.  The cheese is practically still bubbling when you get it on your plate.The slices are a bit on the small side, and like everyone has mentioned, they are expensive!  $5 for a slice, $1 for each topping, and $2 for specialty toppings?!!  2 slices and a drink normally cost about $5 elsewhere...I paid $14 for that here.  Outrageous.But I must admit, they were some tasty slices. The slices are thin, and most of the pizza is firm and crispy, except for the triangle tip (first bite of pizza area).  It was like the pizza was taunting me.  As much as I was eager to pick up the slice to take my first bit, that triangle tip kept drooping and not wanting to get off my plate!  That was the only downside to the pizza (other than the prices).You could definitely taste the olive oil that he drizzles on the pizza...adds a bit of nuttiness to it.  And the pepperoni slices were nice as well.  Smaller, but thicker than your average pepperoni...these are freshly sliced for each order.2 thumbs up...but good luck with the wait time.",8/19/2011,222,138,43,-O57tzZf-qhsAz8uL0hiPA

There is almost always a line out the door, and it starts forming before they even open. The pies are a bit on the small side: 14-16"" and can easily be eaten by 2 people.

For people that complain about the wait or the place, you just don't get it. The place is dirty.

I went today and figured out why. I placed my order for 4 slices and was told it would be ready in 20 mins. My boyfriend and I came back in 20 mins and the counter guy informed us that we took too long so he gave it away. So we put our names down for another 4 slices and decide to wait it out. In 10 mins our slices were ready. Tip: Order your pizza and wait by the counter no matter how long they claim the wait is. The guy who worked the counter today was a low talker, so if you don't pay attention to hear your initials, kiss your pizza goodbye.As for the pizza, it tasted ""ehh just okay."" It was so oily that the oil clouded the taste of the fresh cheese and sauce. The crust was close to burnt. Don't get me wrong, I'm not ready to write off DiFara's. I think on days when the place is crowded and packed and people are standing outside waiting for their pizza, Mr. DiFara does not put the effort and care that he usually does. My pizza tasted rushed, just thrown together to keep the line moving. I recommend that if you can, go on a weekday. My first and memorable DiFara's experience was on a snowy weeknight and the pizza tasted amazing after being out in the cold",5/7/2011Updated review,30,205,56,fxgh2UZ7zMensL4-y-FqHg

The yuppies line up like loyal stooges for an ""authentic new york pizza"" and will wait around like masochists while old man di fara smears his olive oil all over his pizza...in SLOW MOTION. On my way back from a doctors appointment one night, I passed this place and decided to see what the big deal was. I was doing research on some of the great pizzarias of NYC and saw this place listed. The place was officially closed (rope across the doorway) but the window was still open and I asked if thier were any slices left. I was in luck, There was one left over, and seeing that I was outrageously handsome and burning with pure charisma; the lady worker rushed over and put the pizza in the oven for me. A minute later she slid the slice over to me and in a heavy new yawk accent told me it was gonna cost me 5 bucks. 5 bucks? for a slice?? do i look like a tourist to you? I said ""what the hell"" and paid it because NOW I was to damn curious to stop myself. After taking a couple of bites I have to admit..that it was a great slice. Even by NYC standards. Maybe a bit to much olive oil, but still one of the best slices I ever had. Worth 5 bucks? Nah. Worth a half hour/hour wait? nah. not in my opinion. While I believe that Pizza is a great part of NYC heritage, 5 bucks for a plain slice with an hour wait on top of it; sounds ridiculous to me. It prevents me from giving this place 5 stars. Ultimately if you are a out of towner who wants to see what the big deal is and are curious as to what OLD brooklyn pizza tasted like in another era, and you arent put off by the blatant over-charging and long waits, then a slice at DiFaras just might be an offer you can't refuse.",9/29/2010Previous review,0,18,0,hmU2H4WjzjcWg2cfRWlW5g

1993,Jonathan E.,0.0,3,"Well I'm going to risk the wrath of the Pizza Gods for perhaps being blasphemous here, but I simply thought it was pretty decent.  Certainly above average, but for me it didn't raise the bar nor merit a rating of best in all of NYC.I like there's a trek involved, the dive-like corner store (that's it?) and the patriarch assembling each pie one at a time.  Love that they have a bowl of chili-infused oil, and that papa cuts basil with scissors and pours olive oil over the finished pie.  But I was simply only semi-charmed by the taste.I've been trying to put my finger on it and this is what I've concluded:  Some have said it's food like grandma would have made.  And that's just it.  To me, the pizza I had tasted like it was home made.  The sauce and cheese were decent, but not wow.  The ingredients pretty simple, again not wow or pow.  The dough was solid in its holding value, but end crusts had a bit of a undercooked flour taste, and not pillowy (which merits its own debate).  Meanwhile it was a tad charred, which is fine, but it was charred by a very long oven time, as you might get at home with a 400 degree oven that doesn't quite get hot enough (even with a pizza stone) versus the blister-hot coal/wood fired ovens that cook a pizza in 1 or 2 minutes.  Ultimately it comes down to personal taste.  I'd love to try this pie from a 1,200 degree oven.But do go and try.  Half the fun of food is exploring, so see if it fist your tastes.  It definitely has character and is unique to NY.  As for being the best?  Well only you can decide.",1/28/2014,422,1160,1806,aIzN19RssPWSw9nDCPXU3A

On top of that, we were waiting by the side at one point where their side-kitchen door was open and we saw a worker sneeze into his hands, wipe it on his apron and go right back to work....iiickkkkk. Granted, I'm sure the cleanest of kitchens have their own horror stories, but to see it happen just takes the enchantment away a bit. We received our whole pie a whole 2.5+ hrs after and scarfed it down as fast as humanly possible because dinner time had long since passed and true to some review, the pizza is incredibly oily.

And certainly NOT by any stretch GREAT!(or worth $5 a slice)The Pizzeria itself is filthy and falling apart,the MAN himself Chef Domenico Demarco is not the most impressive pizzaiolo I've seen and dirty with little regard to basic food safety!.The pizza itself: the dough has a nice balanced flavor if you like charred crusts,but lacks good texture for thin crust pizza it should be crunchy but easily pulls apart with a bite and melts in your mouth instead it is too hard and crunchy that your mouth and jaw have to work at it with each bite.The sauce is delicious with strong tomato taste just the right amount of sweetness also impArted from the basil to create that near perfect balanced sauce.The cheese was excellent freshly grated and basil though fresh, was in places had spots and wilting.To summarize definitely one of the better spots for pizza in Brooklyn but for $5 a slice and snail like speed of service I could think of a lot better some even cheaper pizzerias (for example BENNYS Pizza, cheaper slices & couple doors down from them)(or if you want artisanal perfection go to Prime Pizza at $10 per personal pie etc....)( I saw another review saying the wait is because of demand! I strongly disagree and think though demand is part of the reason for the wait I went during a time where there where 5 people ahead of me some pies and some slices I just wanted a slice and it took almost 2 hrs.!! That is because of extremely sub-par service for a pizzeria.I mean go to almost any Pizzaria even artisanal Pizzarias and the pies are made SO fast that they make Chef Dimarco look like he is in SLOW-motion!!!)",3/8/2016,37,3,0,201hJ3RXKJ8yQuBTNUq8bA

It was rainy that day. We were the second in line and it took us 15 minutes on line and then another 30 minutes for him to craft us a round pie and a square with pretty much everything topping. With 6 drinks it all came to be about $72 bucks. It's expensive pizza, even by NY standards, and especially so if you're coming to grab just a slice ($5) Who does that anyway? The smell of the fresh ingredients, the dripping pungent olive oil, and sprinkled basil leaves right on top is a feast for the senses. The first bite was incredible. You just wanted to keep eating and eating, faster and faster to race your friends to the next slice. Before long it was all gone. The place is dinky, and dirty-ish.

Some locals that I met turned me on to this place which I have to say blows away EVERY other pizza that i've ever eaten!! You have to try this pizza!There are a few downsides to the place itself. People seem to be germaphobic about the little old man who rolls out the dough then takes your money with the same hand. But let me tell you, that oven is going to kill any dirty little money germs that go into it. The waiting time is also pretty crazy. But damnit, man!! Perfection takes time! There's something to be said about being patient and appreciating while this old school pizza master handcrafts these slices of heaven for you. He lovingly snips off fresh basil onto your slice along with a drizzle of olive oil. The cheese to sauce ratio and crust thickness is just perfect.When I was there last this guy was getting all flustered and annoyed.

2009,Antonio J.,0.0,2,"My wife and I decided to try this pizza yesterday spot after receiving a Zagat saying this was the best pizza in New York. I will give you the full FAIR run-down so you don't waste your time and money. First lets talk about décor...the place is VERY tiny, If you think you will enjoy a pizza with your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend....fughetaboutit! I think only about 10 people could sit down at this DIVE, plus you would be facing a wall sitting cafeteria style bunched up like a sardine, with customers breathing on your pizza while you eat or standing over you. We decided to order a pizza and eat it in our car. Next up Service...So when you order a pizza $5 slice, $28 pie, $32 for classic pie, you have to let the order taker know what you want. In our case it was a guy, (maybe the owner son) but he takes your order on yellow tab paper and you become like a box on a crossword puzzle. You would think with this system, it would be first come first served, but it is not. Although the order taker told us about a 40 min wait, we happily waited to taste why this pizza was so good. Anyway, my wife and I have never been to this pizza joint before but as we were waiting, we started to notice that the order taker was switching boxes with orders. Yep, what I mean is that if you were a regular and you came in after someone else, your pizza came out before the person ahead of you. We both assumed that some of these people may have called in an order, although we heard no phones ringing, and no pizzas waiting for pickup. After we had been waiting for about 20 mins a family can in and placed their order...you guessed it they got their pizza 1bout 10 mins before me. The gentleman said it was his first time at Di Fara. Hmmmm. Finally hows the food? well my rating tell it all. Frank Pepe in New Haven CT IS BY FAR the best tasting pizza! But let me share with you why you may want to save your $28 herd earned bucks! The place is NASTY in terms of being sanitary. The health grade is still pending wich means for a location that has been there that long they must consistently get below an ""A"" grade. This is what we saw on Saturday November 2nd 2013...The same guy who is taking orders with a dirty pen and pad, is the same person handling the money. Cash is one of the filthiest things you can touch because its full of germs. But here is where it gets nasty...yep, the same guy who is touching all those dollar bills, is also going to the back and replenishing the dough (two or three at a time)  for the old man to make the pies. Oh Yeah, no gloves, he's touching the dough with bare dirty, nasty hands. Also, the same guy that touches the money, and the dough, is reaching his filthy hands into the cheese been and grating the cheese. Now about the pizza, when we finally got it about 45 mins later it was a disgrace to true pizza lovers! We tried the classic (sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms) and the toppings were almost non existent. The pizza was to soggy at the ends (your crucial first bite will flop over) and the ends were to hard. (because its a thin crust) The ends were NOT chewy at all. Also, If you like gooey, cheesy pizza, (the kind when you pick up a slice the cheese is all over) then don't go here. They use tree different kinds of cheese and they are lacking on the mozzarella. The sauce did not hold up either as it was pushed to the end of the hard crust!Bottom line...save your money, this place is overrated!",11/11/2013,0,8,0,wDf08UZMjveW94dS3SteJg

2013,John L.,0.0,2,i visited this place after hearing of all the talk about how good there pizza was.We were disappointed with both service and pizza and extremely pricy.  A regular pie was $32.00 with topping's $45.00 for pizza come on.  The calzones were $32.00 each. The place was dirty and needs a total makeover from floor to ceiling.  TThey also need extra help with serving so many customers. The location is a block from the train station but very crowded area.  The sanitary conditions were poor there rating is still pending after 6 months. The owner pit man needs to wash his hands after handling the pies that he produces. He also uses a scissor to cut fresh basil as the pies come out of the oven and sprinkles oil all over the pie making is soupy. The server grinds cheese with his hands and handles the exchange of money as the orders come out. What I place the slices are $5.00 each this place needs a lot of clean up and out of the building.

They have premium toppings... we got porcini mushrooms and pepperoni on one pie and meatballs on another. The olive oil that he drizzles on the pie is supposedly imported from italy.... hmmm i don't know about that but i do know... that this is one scrumptous tasting pie... oh my!

2022,Paul T.,0.0,5,"As a Native New Yorker, I've had the privilege to sample some of the finest pizza in all of NY, pizza such as Totonno's, Grimaldi's, & Lombari's to name a few.  Great pizza artisan's in their own right and I take nothing away from them, BUT, Dom of Di Fara's Pizza, leads this pack of artisan pizza makers.Domenico DeMarco of Di Fara Pizza, AKA ""The Don""  is in a class by himself.  If you haven't had the good fortune of sampling his extraordinary pizza, then I suggest you do, If you don't, you will be doing yourself a disservice.Walking through his door, is like taking a step back through time.  The wood paneled walls painted green for a fresh look, are aligned with well deserved accolades & miscellaneous Italian art.  The counter looks original as do the tables & chairs.You immediately get hit with the sweet aroma of pizza and become almost catatonic.  You give your order and stand aside.  Waiting for at least an hour or so, you become fascinated by how easy he makes taking a pie of pizza out of the oven with his bare hands.  He follows through with drizzling some extra virgin olive oil, and the beautiful basil he cuts with a scissor over your pie.  Then you realize ""Oh yeah, its not my pie"", it's someone else's and you suddenly start becoming anxious.Soon enough the moment arrives, and you take your pizza to stay, because taking it to go, means more waiting, and that equates to unnecessary suffering.  And if you can not get a seat, then do what I do, eat it in your car.Then comes the first bite. You will literally feel like someone punched you in the mouth with some brass goodness.  It's that good.  So perfect, you'll taste every ingredient and savor every bite.When visiting remember to bring your own wine.  Dom is more than happy to open it for you and hand you some plastic cups.

Thankfully, I didn't have to trek out on the Q to get there. I could drive like 10 minutes over. We didn't have to wait, as it was a week day, and our pie came out right away. It was delicious, but I'm not going to go as far as to say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it's def. in the top 5 margarita pizzas out there. (Pepe's in New Haven comes to mind, as does Luigi's in Brooklyn. Luigi's fresh slice is possibly my favorite.)You can bring your own booze, so that's a nice addition.One thing that really makes the food good is the flavor from the oven and the pans. That also means they smoke a lot...and I mean a lot.

2026,Molly D.,0.0,3,"This place has sparked lengthy, circular disagreements in my house - and if my husband were writing this review, it would be 5 stars. Di Fara Pizza fascinates me because of the debate it inspires, mainly. The pizza's really good. I am an impatient person - so when I have to wait a really, really, really long time for something I start to resent it. This pizza would have to be the best pizza I've ever had in order for me to get over the wait, the discomfort, the heat, etc. And it's not the best pizza I've ever had. The best pizza I've ever had is around the corner from where I used to live in New Jersey, and I never had to wait more than 30 minutes for it. Something about the talking points in favor of Di Fara - Old man won't give up the recipe! Old man won't let anyone else make the pizzas! Old man doesn't care that the health department would rather he did not touch your pizza with his bare hands! Buffalo mozzarella from Italy! Home-grown basil! Intense mom-and-pop atmosphere!  - just enrages me when I'm entering the second hour of waiting on the pizza.

People line-up for this pizza but I wonder if they're just Zagat zombies.I think of a great pizza as the New York style Famous Ray's pizza. Perfect amount cheese and sauce on a thin yet crispy crust. Many pizzerias can acheive this in Brooklyn and NY in general. DiFara's turns out hot but lumpy and un-crispy slices. The cheese felt like it was runny and the sauce was too strong. That maybe his interpretation of a ""rustic"" style pizza but it's not great pizza to me.I've eaten there a bunch of times, trying to believe the hype but my impression is that they are over-rated.",6/1/2008,66,287,121,w-pGm1MfyHRvbL1x5NxiMA

Got a little ancy because the seating really sucks but enjoyed watching Dominic performart on each pizza. While cooking he has so much love in what he is doing, there is nothing like I have seen before. The pricing for 2 pies and 3 drinks was over $60bucks.

2036,Louis W.,0.0,3,"Overall, Di Fara's pizza is OK. Don't get me wrong! The pizza is pretty good. Traditionally hand-made, fresh ingredients, basil topped, brick oven-baked. That's all really nice. And I can also appreciate the story of Domenico DeMarco and how he also slowly hand makes ALL of the pizza's with love and expertise. But for the price, it's just too expensive compared to all the other pizzas I've eaten before. It might be the hype, the fresh ingredients, I don't know! A plain square sized pie is almost $30. With three drinks, total came out to $36. Really pricey. And because of this, it has to be AWESOME, not just pretty good. Some other gripes I have is that our pizza was really burnt around some parts of the crust. I mean blackened. Not a huge fan of that. And it was really saucy. This might be a preference thing. I guess one thing I can appreciate is that we didn't have to wait very long for the pizza (about 10-15 minutes). I've heard about this place's legendary wait times and I'm glad I didn't have to go through that for a pretty good $30 pizza pie.",1/30/2012,41,46,2,REDrQ8DKeZaS8N1wqjh89w

When I saw Dom grab a pie from the oven with his bare hands, my mouth dropped to the floor. I thought to myself, ""Damn that has to be hot as f*ck!"" After reading one of the articles on the wall (trust me, you will have plenty of time to do so) I learned he no longer has feeling sensation in his fingers. My favorite part is when he gets a fresh bunch of basil and cuts it with scissors onto the pizza, then pours olive oil onto it. I could probably sit at Di Fara all day and just watch Dom.When our square pie was ready, I went up to the counter and he said, ""Is this yours?"" with his accent sounded more like 'Is this yos?"" I had the biggest smile across my face. Just knowing the fact that he's been in the same spot for 50 years and is probably about 72 years old and still makes every single pizza by himself, is an amazing feat in my eyes.Now on to the pizza. We got pepperoni and mushroom pie. OMFG it was delicious. You can tell Di Fara uses quality ingredients and adding fresh basil and olive oil is genius. And the crust, OMG the crust. It was the best pizza crust I've ever had, perfectly crispy. I probably said ""this crust is sooo good"" to my friends about ten times. Just beware, the restaurant does get very warm and hot inside and it's tiny. We lucked out and got a table. If you visit NY, you definitely have to go to Di Fara and have Dom's pizza.

I was disappointed that the not thin enough crust, rather than resembling that of pizzas I've had in Italy or at other famed New York pizzerias,  reminded me of one Enzo's/Pizza Palace of New Jersey, which is, at best, passable for Jersey, and, at worst, cardboardy.  I also found that the addition of the pungent grana padano overwhelmed all the other components.  I wonder if this topping would work better as an optional topping that customers could add on themselves like the hot red peppers.  The abundance of extra virgin olive oil was also unpalatable.  Still, all New Yorkers ought to make a pilgrimage here at least once to judge the pizza for themselves.",12/9/2010,775,625,1143,j1IpRoDB4_EGalcFItxCxg

Finally I got a slice, and the moment I took the first bite I couldn't help but laugh and think about that famous PT Barnum quote. The pizza was garbage.

As soon as I'd moved into the neighborhood, all my friends (even the ones who lived in the Bronx and Jersey) told me I was in a great location because of my close proximity to Di Fara. I've lived in Midwood for 2 years now and have only eaten at Di Fara two times. The wait is ridiculous (at least 10 to 20 minutes to get individual slices) and about 1-1/2 to 2 hours for a pie. On the weekends, the lines go out the door and wrap around the corner. The prices are also high for a Brooklyn pizzeria (they even beat some Manhattan prices). I've only seen 3 people, the most, working inside. Everyone knows Dom, the grandpa in the front flipping the pizza dough and smothering the pies with mozzarella and olive oil. His son works in the front alongside him. There's one more person in the back (rumor has it that he's another son).In the end, if you have the time and patience, Di Fara's is worth the wait.",3/18/2009,591,962,52,JZ7RPFpDhPHa4ay_wTnRDA

2060,Kenny L.,0.0,5,"Never have I waited outside a pizzeria for a slice.However, I will always make an exception for this place. Once you enter, you smell the aroma for fresh basil, olive oil, pizza dough, and previous pizzas that left the oven.It's so warm and welcoming here with people speaking to each other while waiting, observing the numerous awards throughout the walls, or simply admiring a master pizza maker doing his thing.Wait time was ok, I measured from the point I ordered to receiving my order. 30mins. Relatively quick. Now, if you were further down the line, patience may be tested, but you will be greatly rewarded.I came here for the first time and decided to order the pie ($25). Delicious! Soft crust and the thinness just right. Fresh cheese, basil, and a dollop of olive oil for finishing touches. And it's not as if it's one pie immediately after the other. The man takes his time observing if the crust is just right and will hold off the next pie if his satisfaction is not met.The crew (his children) are friendly and will help get condiments for customers. They pace the orders according to the pizza maker and keep the customers happy.I finished 6/8 slices myself. I couldn't resist because the slices are just that exceptional! Goodness, I doubt I can find anywhere else in NYC that can compare to this place. Probably have to leave for Italy to get a fair comparison. For $5 a slice, the pie is a better choice. Next time, the DiFara Special $30 for me.Ultimately, you will be satisfied.",10/30/2010,125,307,294,Wa82CbyQ18SdKJ-8RBXHJQ

2069,Chief H.,0.0,4,"How do I even approach a review of Di Fara Pizza?Invariably, it's discussed from one of two perspectives: the virgin and the veteran. I'm sorry to say, but these tropes are as stale as it gets (yes you're guilty).The virgins write as if entering a sacred (likely Catholic) shrine for the first time (I think they picture themselves in an Indiana Jones movie). Photographs are a constant, but everyone still seems to show an incongruous reverence normally reserved for a pope, head of state or Lady Gaga. After an already eternal wait, they meekly place their order, waiting in line for their baptism in pizza grease and holy extra virgin olive oil. Finally, once the pizza itself is a mere formality, they depart slightly heavier, but spiritually reborn (or something like that).Veterans, on the other hand, burnish their credibility by claiming to have been among the first to try Di Fara (while Midwood locals reminisce at how Di Fara used to be before the crowds). They worship at the alter of Pope Dom DeMarco, and write about Di Fara in tones of a wise man leading a rapturous flock to a holy Midwood pilgrimage, spreading salvation to those poor souls who's heathen lips have never touched the most holy blessed pizza in existence.If my comments show anything, it's that I'm sorely lacking in whimsy or the ability to accept anything with more than jaded cynicism (being only 26, this deeply disturbs me). More importantly, I've overused the Catholic imagery and relied too much on the sarcasm. No one wants to sound like this guy (which I did after my first draft).Still, I'm also compelled to admit that, until recently, I too was a Di Fara virgin.Sure, my experience was less stressful than others. My friends got there early on a Saturday morning, allowing me to dodge the wait while seizing a prime table (the largest) directly across from the counter.Waiting for our pizza, we talked about food (as we almost always do). Even while catching up with a college friend who I hadn't seen since graduation, our discussion eventually circled back towards eating. At the same time, the conversations of other line-waiters stamping foodie bingo cards grew louder as more people packed into the narrow restaurant. Hearing these conversations (almost exactly like ours) just made me more cynical. Why the hell am I waiting for a pizza like this, I wondered. The likelihood that the answer was ""because everyone else is in line,"" and I'm not all that special (despite what my mother says) was frightening.Now I question whether I have anything to say (assuming you care in the first place) about Di Fara that hasn't been written a million times before. I want to tell interesting stories about food and restaurants, but how many times can you read about someone going to DiFara's (I guess it's too late to worry about that if you've read this far), before you too become jaded to all of it?I do take a little pleasure in contributing. I think it's just that I'm a contrarian asshole that this stuff gets to me (a hypocrite too!), but shouldn't I be out looking for the ""next"" Di Fara rather adding to the endless praise?Back to the pizza. Relax. Focus on the food (and make sure to breathe). It's just pizza, albeit very good pizza.The traditional pie arrived quickly--half plain half pepperoni. Nearly as good (and as oily) as I'd hoped. I dug the mozzarella, Grana Padano and the herbal bite of basil (allegedly sourced from Israel). The cheeses, combined with the acidity of the tomato sauce, displayed a near-perfect synergy of toppings, while the crust was suitably chewy (but in the parlance of Adam Kuban, it displayed notable tip sag). And yes, I lost a measure of cynicism when I heard DeMarco ask, ""Issa dis your pie?"" after our sausage and eggplant Sicilian pizza came out of the oven (also after another forty minute wait).Even still, my overanalysis likely prevented complete enjoyment of the decadent Sicilian pizza (as it does with so many other things) before me. Sitting at my table, a dated, framed Time Out magazine proclaiming the opening of DiMarco's on Houston (with Parker Posey and Ethan Hawke staring back at me) proved almost too much of a distraction while strings of melted cheese and droplets of oil fell from my chin. For a brief moment I felt as if I had achieved the state of mind that others had written about so reverently, but soon realized that I was probably just experiencing a rush of endorphins from the cheese and oil burning through the roof of my mouth.Sometimes it's better to think less, respect the moment, and let that oil drip.",12/14/2010,33,76,3,L1mMQhpRkToKQU_rtm4IRw

I actually had attempted to come here once before, but of course I didn't think to check whether they were actually open and instead had to take the subway out 1 hour just to find that they are closed on Mondays. (just in case you were planning to try and come here on a Monday DON'T DO IT!) One Saturday and 2 hours later by bike, we finally arrived at this famed pizza joint. The pizza did NOT disappoint!! Maybe it tasted better because we were famished and had to wait another 45 minutes once we got there for Mr. Domenico Demarco to actually make the pizza, but it was sooo good. Between three girls we finished a whole pie. We got sausage and mushroom for toppings and Dom topped it with fresh basil as he does every pizza. The place itself is very bare bones. It's definitely no upscale pizza place. You either sit at one of three tables next to the walls, and if you're a small party you'll probably be sharing that table with strangers. Also, expect to wait a long time here no matter what. We didn't even have that many people in front of us but we still had to wait close to an hour for our pizza. Although the pizza was probably one of the freshest tasting and best I've had, I don't know if I would make the trek and wait that long again just to get the pizza a second time...unless I lived closer. It's definitely worth checking out at least once though and please go soon.

ALL of those places are better than Di Faras. My gf and I took the trip out to BK one day to see if it lived up to the hype we read online and also from a friend who swore it was the best pizza. There was surprisingly no line out the door when we got there. Once inside there is literally nowhere to sit, they have a 2 or 3 small tables. Ordering is where things started to go south. The old man was doing his thing behind the counter making the pizzas, but the guy who was working the counter was very rude. I asked him for 3 square slices and he looked me at me said ""no square slices"" and then immediately ignored me and turned his attention to the next person. The next person was a foreigner who ask for a regular slice, he brought her the slice asked for $5 and when the foreigner did not understand he literally took the slice back and ignored her. I then got his attention and just asked for regular slices bc i just wanted to get out of there.  The slices are SMALL and they charge $5 for each one. To top it off the slices were burnt on the bottom, my hands were stained with black and the pizza tasted horrible.Dont waste your time with this place, you are better off going to Juliana's and getting a pie for $16 or any of the other pizza spots I mentioned at the top of my review.",5/27/2015,69,2,0,sU1ffl47FglcfLOjWMZCjQ

On one of my slice the crust was burnt to black and it was inedible, on the other one it was completely dry. While the sauce tasted really good, and the fresh basil was a nice touch to it, I found the cheese too salty, and the pizza overall too greasy. For $ 10 (for 2 slices) I was expecting more and better!",1/10/2013,21,7,0,PnRLOn0KGhCyBTqeOWA1uw
2095,Kevin C.,0.0,5,"Super expensive slices and a loooooooooooooong line, but once you sink your teeth into their freshly out-of-the-oven goodness, you'll realize all the hype is definitely warranted and that you'll gladly pay double or triple what they charge.  Growing up in NYC, my preference is the regular NY slice over the thin-crust, by the pie pizza like Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Nick's and definitely over the awful pizza quiche they make over in Chicago.  Now, what DiFara serves is a slice that's made closer to a thin-crust, but it still keeps its traditional NY sliceness, if that makes any sense.  I've had a lot of pizza all over NYC (definitely the pizza capital of the world), the U.S., the world, including Napoli, and I can say DiFara serves the best pizza without a doubt.",8/5/2013,104,113,9,__y1QHnPBvMmB-OmzWBKtQ

2098,Jim H.,0.0,5,"Pizza is pizza, right? I mean, I've had pizza I like better than others but the variant between the best and worst is pretty slim. At least, this is what I thought before Difaras.I was getting tired of Aaron saying how good Difaras was. I mean, shut up dude, it's freaking pizza! Although I should have known seeing that Aaron is rarely off in his recommendations.When he suggested heading for Brooklyn, on an early Sunday morning, I was all too ready to go and decide for myself. That and as a teen, I had worn out a Beastie Boys cassette listening to "" No Sleep Til Brooklyn"" and I was curious to visit.So we set out on our Pizza pilgrimage to Brooklyntown ( or as Jessie Jackson once called it Hymietown). The trip up was amazingly easy ( remember this was Sunday morning). From the Art Museum in Philly to parking on a side street near Difaras in Flatbush, it took 1 1/2 hours. The Difaras experience was interesting to say the least. It opens at noon, and already at 10am people were milling around, waiting to get in.  Difaras is located in a decidedly orthodox Jewish neighborhood , where everything is kosher ...except Difaras. Because of this, some Rabbis take it upon themselves, to inform the people waiting to get in, that eating there is a sin. This led to a hilarious exchange between Aaron ( who is self proclaimed "" Jewy"") and the rabbi, who didn't think he was Jewish.Early on, we got bad news. Someone emerged from Difaras to inform the growing crowd that they won't be opening til 1pm. He was, however, nice enough to take our order so that we would get the first pies out of the oven.With our order in, we took a stroll around the cool neighborhood. Were it not for our reason for being there, I would have loved to get a nosh from one of the amazing Jewish bakeries and delis there. When we returned to Difaras, a good sized line had formed and we regretted not holding our spot in line because even though we had our order in, the seating at Difaras is minimal.Once again, luck favored us here because as the gates opened, everyone rushed the counter and we were able to slip past and secure a table.Keep in mind though, that we were 3 rather large men and the table was barely suitable for 2 children not to mention having to deal with 3 large pies.As promised, the pies came out immediately after we sat and I can tell you that every complaint, every inconvenience , any negative thought was erased as I bit in to that masterpiece. Difaras does for pizza what Sycamore does for a meal in that it makes you realize how good something can actually be. It makes you realize that what you were used to, was mediocre at best.The afternoon following the first bite was a blur. I remember the crisp tasty crust, the fresh tasty toppings, the heat, the flavor. The seating was stuffy and cramped, but I assure you, we felt like we were in heaven.  As we emerged from Difaras, we had to fight through the line of less fortunate people, in a line that wrapped around a corner. Having just eaten that amazing pizza, I both pitied and understood the waiting masses unsatisfied faces.The ride back home was not as smooth and all told the day had cost us each a good $50, between food and tolls. Yet I don't regret it in the least. This was an experience. Something that everyone should try at least once. To make a trip for something so worthwhile is what living is all about.",9/12/2010,760,382,46,AvGJVv7Z3a0q1MJT1Ykd0w

2108,Shawn T.,0.0,5,"Oh man.  What can I say about this place?  If you are ever in NYC, I'd suggest you take a trip into Brooklyn just to get a slice of the best pizza in New York.  Yes I've had Lombardi's, but in my opinion, Di Fara's is on a different level.  Lombardi's might have been the original, but the original isn't always the best.Di Fara's is located conveniently right across the street from the Ave. J subway station, so transportation is pretty convenient.  As another reviewer has mentioned, get in line, and get ready to wait a bit just to place your order.  It took me about 30 min before I was able to get on ""the list"".  Trust me its worth it.  After that, comes the most agonizing wait as Old Man Dom gets to work on your pizza.  Dom is a master.  All the decades of making pizza must have made his hands impervious to heat because he reaches into the oven bare-handed to turn your pie while its baking (intense).  After about another 20 min, the pizza is ready.Dom uses amazingly fresh ingredients.  Fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and herbs.  After the pizza comes out of the oven, he'll cut fresh basil straight onto your pie to add even more flavor.What's amazing about this pizza isn't just one thing, but its a combination of everything.  Fresh ingredients and a great sauce makes it great, but his crusts brings it all together.  The fabled New York water helps, but because Dom is the only one that bakes the pizza, it is always consistent, and just perfect.  The actual shop is small.  Half of which is the occupied by the register and kitchen.  Seating is scarce so I got mine to-go.  The place is pretty much always jam packed with customers enjoying  their pizza, and there is almost always a line out the door.  Decor on the wall is full of personal affects from the years Di Fara has been open, with pictures of Dom as a young boy, to the next generation.The price for a slide is extremely steep at $5, so I'd go for a pie and share.  Even then, it will be the best $5 slice you will ever have, if its not, then it will be on your top 3.Di Fara Pizza gets my top vote for the best pizza in New York, and looks like I'm not the only one that thinks so at it was voted best pizza in New York again for the year 2011.Get over to Ave. J and check this place out.  It's an absolute treasure.",4/21/2011,286,7,3,YaJBZHCZBeIxqOSn9eYN3w

He literally cut fresh basil onto the pizza. It was rather entertaining at first watching him making it. Then it starts to get annoy after you stand there for 30 min and still 5 people in front of you. Anyway, I finally got the famous pizza and bought it back home to my husband and his sister. They are FOB from Italy. I was excited to bring the famous Italian pizza home which is probably very close to the real Italian pizza from Italy. They took 2 bites and both said OMG! It's so salty! That popped my balloon.. I waited almost a hour for the pizza and I get that? Oh, well, guess it's just NY pizza and one in the life time experience.",7/7/2015,24,14,5,UxZ2rS4p0pNKrtO_LtNfBw

I can't in good conscience review cheese, dough, sauce, and basil at those prices without knocking off a star.To be honest though, the flavors are good.  No one ingredient stood out for me as far as the pizza goes, but as a complete package, it all worked really well.  I liked the addition of olive oil at the end, but could do without half the bottle being poured on the pizza.  The ingredients were fresh, high quality, and authentic, but the fact that part of the pizza crust was burnt ruined that for me a little, minus a half star for that.  The ambiance is nothing to behold.  I can't fault them for that, only wonder what the heck he's doing with the rest of the money from his $$$ pizza.All in all, Di Fara's was definitely delish, certainly a must-try, but my quest for the perfect pie still continues.",5/24/2011,90,113,32,IXieadLLVDzCYFQF0rGBKA

Apparently back in the day when Midwood was becoming more Hasidic, all the restaurant owners closed up shop and left because they thought they'd stop getting business. Not Dom. And that was a BRILLIANT decision. Seriously, I will go to Avenue J to go glatt kosher shopping with my mother only on the proviso that I can have Di Fara Pizza when we're finished. Yes, it is a very long wait. Yes, there is not a lot of sitting or standing room. Yes, it's slightly dingy. Yes, it sucks that it's recently gone up to $5 a slice. But the smell, and the sight of the ropes of garlic and the bunches of tomatoes and bushes of basil and rows of cheese, let alone the actual finished pizza, is so, so, so worth it. No ordinary pizza parlor is like this one. This is how pizza is supposed to be done. It has the thinnest crust, the ripest tomatoes, the freshest basil, the most flavorful cheese. And trust me, I have had pizza in every borough several times over, I have had pizza in many regions of many countries, and the pizza at Di Fara is in my top ten- no, top five best in the entire world. Did you hear that? THE ENTIRE WORLD.Come back and talk to me when you've had pizza all over the entire world. I'm still not going to fight about this.",12/4/2010,18,45,0,mDPtNowrzKDJ4KhO9uB3-A

2124,Lisa N.,0.0,4,"Despite the notoriety Di Fara has received for failing health inspections, nothing was going to stop us from eating one of the world renowned pies served up by the hands of Dom DeMarco. Especially after a prior trek to Midwood to consume one of his pies, only to discover the pizzaiolo was on vacation. On that occasion, we weren't going to go home empty-bellied, and hopped right back on the Q train to try Totonno's. This time we were in luck.Upon entering, we observed Dom behind the counter, kneading the dough into perfection, completely oblivious to the growing crowds, his mind completely intent on serving up one of his signature pizzas. For each pie, he painstakingly shreds the fresh mozzarella and distributes it evenly across the pie. Once out of the oven, he tops it with some fresh basil, which I am confident has not been washed, but that just adds a little bit of flavor. For a finishing touch, he drizzles the pizza with olive oil and sprinkles on some grana padana cheese.On a Sunday afternoon, the line didn't appear to be too long. Within a minute or two, we placed our order for a large round pie. The man taking orders informed us the pie would be ready in about an hour. An hour later, our pie was finally ready. Less than 5 minutes later, the pie had been completely consumed. The crust was top notch, thin crust and crispy, almost to the point of being burned but not quite. Very solid ratio of sauce to cheese, with the canned San Marzano tomatoes counterbalancing the sweetness of the sauce with a touch of acidity.Definitely worth the wait.

I wanted it to be, believe me, I went in with high hopes.  But can I tell you that I actually THREW OUT a slice since I couldn't stand to eat more than 2! I laid it on the top of the trash can I stood next to the whole time, hoping a bum or a hungry child would take advantage.  I probably should have just sold it for $15 to one of the many people still waiting to get inside to join the mob trying to order at the counter.Save yourself time and money and try out one of the many other pizza legends that this city has to offer.

There a handful of places just as good or much better than Di Faras, one that happens to be in walking distance of where I live in Queens.  When one thinks about the type of pizza it is, Di Faras is not gourmet, it's not brick oven. One has to compare it to a regular slice of pizza with no bells and whistles.Rays in the city, Rosas in Maspeth all land in that category and rank much higher in my book, and  much, much closer to heaven.",11/1/2010,142,206,0,wdOHjBJXbyzlBzOhILsD9w

EVER. pizza perfection, which to me is crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, not too thin, not too thick. when i bit into the chunky tomatoes that were part of the sauce, it was like pizza heaven in that one slice with all that great combination of flavor in sauce, smoky crust, quality pepperoni, cheese (freshly grated by hand by the man) and fresh cut basil sprinkled with some romano. i compared this to the 3 other joints we tried while visiting NYC (Lombardi's, Rubirosa, John's). all being great pies in their own right, this stuck in my memory first!be patient and you shall be greatly rewarded :)",11/1/2012,36,117,5,gFharXEwonMiXaMP0Uk8uw

Can't say that, but it doesn't mean that I don't give my pizza stamp of approval to Di Fara's.Di Fara's is small (walked past it when I was looking for it!), but I actually really like that down home type of ambiance. It's definitely just a place where you roll in to grab a slice or pick up a pie in jeans and a t-shirt. It's great pizza, but in a whole different way compared to the ""chi chi"" ness of an L.A. pizzeria (which is a completely different kind of pizza). I wanted to get some real authentic NY pizza while I was out there this past summer, so I stopped in to Di Fara's and wasn't disappointed.I loved the fresh basil cut on top of my pizza and how there was just the right amount of cheese on top of what tasted like some very authentic (as in, real tomatoes) sauce. I wanted the slices to be a little bigger, but I was more than satisfied with the quality of the pizza to be happy to pay about $10 for a couple slices and a can of soda. I love me some olive oil, so I was more than happy to get a little extra on top with the basil and found this to be a great example of a NY slice o' 'za. It's a little out of the way if you're in the more touristy places of NYC, but I think it's worth stopping in if you're in search of some authentic NY-style pizza.",9/1/2008,850,512,1156,eafWEvwyHtbwPMSn8Elimw

BTW, those of you who complain about the location (you wimpy Manhattanites who don't know what a daily commute to work is like), stay home and order Dominos then. There's plenty of us that don't mind that it's in a residential/local business/not much to do area. BUUUT since this is just a hole in the wall pizzeria, you should not expect much of an atmosphere anyway. Which is fine by me because the pizza here is unbelievably freakin amazing. I couldn't stop thinking about it days after I ate it so I got some last night and yes, went through the ridiculous wait again but all is forgiven when you see Dom hard at work on your dough..removing a perfect pie from the oven and putting in the box, drizzling it with olive oil (watch that baby bubble!) and scissor-cut a bushel of fresh basil onto it..and don't forget the perfectly salty cheese. It's heavenly..it's tantalizing, it's unforgettable, and worth the wait. Granted, some parts of the crust can get burnt but that's what adds to its genuine, hand-made with love and inexplicable skill. p.s. Dom and the chick who takes the orders actually smiled at me this time.

I can't believe I didn't have this EVERY DAY when I lived right around the corner from Avenue J (well I can, considering if I did, I'd have a coronary in my late 20's). What Dom does there is really art. He gingerly with so much care and heart oven bakes each pie. As he asks you what you would like with his subtle and gentle smile, you feel like a kid at a candy store. DiFara's contains the essence of NYC, more specifically Brooklyn. The wait is can range from 30 min during the mid afternoon when nobody is around to 2 hrs during high traffic hours but its completely worth it.

We each had a slice there and took the rest back to Manhattan with us. It was PHENOMENAL. The reason for the 4-star review, you ask? The excessive amount of time it took to acquire said pizza.

2185,Lisa F.,0.0,5,"Complain about the wait all you'd like. Complain about the cost all you'd like. Is the pizzeria a dingy corner shop that looks like it's been around since the 60's?! Hell yes it is. And that makes it all the better. Regardless of what you say, Di Fara's truly is the benchmark by which all other pizza should be measured. And if you disagree, I'm sorry to say, but you don't know good pizza. It's as simple as that. I was born and raised by Italians in Brooklyn (arguably, the borough with the best food - best Italian food at the very least). I know good pizza when I taste it, and this is it!Take note: If you're not a fan of fresh basil or parmesan cheese, I highly recommend going elsewhere - perhaps your local Domino's which will serve up bland slices of cardboard to your liking.Dom DiMarco - you're the man. You make your pies at your own pace, and they never let me down. The best pizza in NYC is worth the hour wait, and I'll gladly dish out the extra $ for top-of-the-line ingredients imported from Italy. I actually feel a very peaceful zen-like wave fall over me while I watch him work. If anyone reading this review can honestly recommend someplace better than Di Fara - send me a private message, and if I find you're correct, I'll totally alter my review.

I won't wax poetically about Dom placing boiling hot pies into boxes bare-handed, snipping fresh basil onto pizza, or the long wait.Location: Deep in brooklyn, Midwood.The Space: Everything but the pizza counter is old, musty, dusty, and dirtyThe wait: Well worth it for fresh piesThe craft: I have no idea how he gets such amazing quality out of gas fired ovens. Other than noticing he has two working at different temperatures- the top one seems to be running hot to get a good crisp, the second one seems to be a finishing bake to cook all the way through.The pizza:Reheated round slice- Underwhelming, not recommended especially at $5 a pop.Pro Tip- Order a square pizza and eat it fresh. AMAZING. Perfect flavors, rich and complex. A rainbow of texture, full-bandwidth mouth experience. Very fulfilling. The combination of carbs and oil brings about a great food high for the hungry. You can taste what 40 years of refining recipes does in this one.The verdict:A must eat. Brooklyn, New-York style pizza. Worth traveling from far distances.

2194,Gene C.,0.0,5,"I had been planning on trying Dom's world-famous pizza for months now, and my friend and I finally worked up the energy to trek down to Brooklyn after a night of solid partying.  We got there at 4 PM on a Saturday, which is actually when the store is supposed to close and then re-open at 6.  We found that the place was very much alive, to our delight, but that a whole Sicilian pie (which is what all 15 other people in the small shop were also waiting for) would take up to 2 hours at least.  After putting our names down for 2 whole pies (honestly, if you're coming here, you might as well) and wandering around in Park Slope for an hour and a half, we came back to find Dom boxing our pizzas in front of a line that hadn't changed in size.The pizza: glorious.  The bread is just the right thickness, not as thick as most Sicilians but very far from your traditional NY slice.  The man adds generous amounts of olive oil to the bottom of the pan, which causes the pizza to basically fry in its pan while in the oven, much like Pizza Hut style but lighter and more airy.  The mozzarella is a tiny bit on the sparser side (even though he adds more at different points in the pizza-making process) but practically liquifies on top of hot, bubbly fresh tomato ""sauce"" (really, it tastes more like stewed fresh tomatoes).  The fresh basil, cut with scissors on top of the completed pie, takes it over the top.  My only complaint is that I generally don't like my pizza blackened around the rims, which seemed relatively standard here and is a small blemish to an overall masterpiece.Each pie is cut into 12 slices, and I ate my share of 6 slices in one sitting, hands-down the best pizza I've had in NY (although I'm looking to try Keste, Artichoke, and Grimaldi's).  Slightly nauseating?  Yes.  Did I burn parts of my tongue?  Yes.  Did I cut up the roof of my mouth with the crust?  Unfortunately, yes.  Would I do it all over again?  Absolutely, preferably some time later this month.",12/21/2010,392,115,21,pNDsq4v56zTT2xhyYvUMQQ

I had to pick off charred carbon from the bottom of a dry, bitter crust... Yikes.  Something about the balance of cheese and sauce was off too (too little sauce I think).  At $5 a slice, I was really hoping for a good experience.Perhaps it was an off day?  Even so, shouldn't there be quality control?  If a pizza is obviously burned, they shouldn't sell it (they didn't even blink when they called my name for the order), especially at $30 for a sad, non-basil-ed pie.",4/30/2011,11,64,8,uuKfSKQ8YmfcGoPx66nNFA

The place was FILTHY, but I mean disgusting. The owner looked like he hadn't washed his clothes in weeks and his hands didn't look too clean either for that matter and he was touching everything with his bare hands. The price for a slice was $5. That's for 1 slice! My friend and I looked at each other after inspecting the place silently and we both agreed that this place did not look too ""kosher"" (no pun intended for my Jewish friends and neighbors). As we left we looked behind the counter from the window and there was bug spray, drano, rags, etc. all over the place. The floors were gross.

The pizza is fresh out the oven and so many people ordered by the pie that is part of the reason for the wait. I had 2 slices with sausage  and they were good. The basil on the slice does ad a bit of flavor to. It's the wait that sucks. I understand it's busy there but the process is slow there. It's also tough to justify spending $5 a slice add another $1 for the sausage topping, especially since the slices are not as big as you would expect.

Then, I heard it again after going on Scott's Pizza Tours and I made it my mission to come and visit this place. My friend and I trekked here on a Saturday, traveling all the way from NJ just to have a taste of the pizza. My friend had it before and said it was the best pizza he ever tasted so nonetheless, my expectations for this pizza was through the roof. I can say for sure, this place makes the best pizza I have ever eaten. Say what you want about the old, dirty shop, or the lack of seating area, or the long wait for the food. The food speaks for itself. My friend and I got there quarter past 1pm, ordered and had our food and was seated in half an hour. We split a regular pie, which totaled $38. I don't know how the math worked out, but I wanted to try the food. Before I started, I wasn't exactly that hungry. However, I finished four of my slices easily. The ingredients the guy uses are the freshest, from the basil, to the sauce, to the cheese. The crust was perfect. The only qualm I had with it was the liberal use of olive oil on the pizza, but regardless, the pizza was well worth the trip and money. This place definitely lives up to the hype and I would highly recommend any pizza-lover to travel here and eat the food at least once.

2220,Siri S.,0.0,5,"I love this place.  Grew up in Brooklyn with good pizza around and not too far from here and unfortunately only heard about it when I was about 28 years old, (13 years ago). What a waste of my childhood and teens as it has been there during those years as this pizza surpasses your good old delicious slice.The pizza is insanely good, not like any you find elsewhere. Olive Oil is added while it's in the oven, then comes out sizzling which is the perfect time to add the fresh parmesan on top and watch it slightly melt, and then the fresh cut basil. Always hot, as there is so much traffic there. I have seen Dom, if its quiet in the day ( (this is rare) ) throw out a slice if it has been sitting out too long as he doesn't want to serve it to anyone. Usually, people order their own pies.  The square slice (or Pie) is also quite divine and sometimes I don't know which to get and hope they both are out but that is rare. Toppings are beautiful, however, I just prefer the beauty of the regular with nothing added to change the flavor. If in a topping mood, the broccoli rabe with garlic, or the imported from Italy porcini mushrooms are amazing.Is it worth the wait?......Yes, if you show up knowing you can wait, maybe give yourself something to do with friends, have a drink or order and come back. otherwise, you may get cranky and irritable.

2236,Perry C.,0.0,5,"My girlfriend and I decided we had to try Di Fara since it is a Brooklyn staple, and generally regarded as the best pizza in the city. Boasting that it is 'worth the wait', which I've heard can be up to 3 hours on busy nights, we tried our luck and headed over to dine in. It has limited seating, but that is most places in NYC to begin with, so if you are bringing a large group, you might have to get creative with your seating arrangements. The pies are a tad pricey, but I have to say that it lived up to the hype. We waited in total about an hour, but a quick trip down the street to grab a bottle of wine to bring in made the wait bearable, and the pizza was  perfect. We went with the original, which was a little bit damp at the tip of the slice, but each slice became more and more amazing as you get toward the crust, which was the perfect consistency and super delicious.My theory on pizza has always been that anyone can throw good toppings on a pizza. Toppings don't make the pizza; you have to have an amazing crust to make it truly remarkable, and this crust is top notch. It also helps that the ingredients Di Fara uses are great. The cheese is that wonderful Buffalo mozzarella that I can easily say is the envy of the rest of the country, but it's the crust, man! The crust! It's basically the beauty of a real lye bagel in a pizza crust, if that makes sense.",3/2/2013,16,13,0,5XeHJAA3k00ectP3y0WqsQ

How this joint passes inspection is beyond me. It is a dump. The extremely limited seating seems to have been rescued from a landfill. You are required to order through a window... after a considerable wait our order was taken. We were informed by a tattered cardboard sign roped across the entrance that after our order was placed our name would be called, with permission granted to spend upwards of thirty minutes, standing inside the doorway. We watched in amazement while presumably Mr Di Fara, performing at a pace befitting his years, slowly constructed pizza and placed them in a three level pizza oven that only had one level working. Anxious to sample the exorbitantly priced slice ($5) we finally received a slice that  was so carbon crusted as to be practically inedible.If you would like to experience slow, torturous service in an abominable atmosphere with inedible food - this is the place for you.",10/2/2015,0,4,0,tE1HStTobIFDqfA4QTTpYg

I've tried DiFara a couple of times recently when back on visits and I'm not impressed. A couple years ago we bought a pie and when we got it home discovered it was burned. I didn't post any reviews although no respectable place should let a burned pie go out. I was walking past today and it was almost empty so I swallowed my pride and spent $5 on a slice, hoping that I would finally get why people come from so far. I also believe those who say the owner is a nice guy so I wanted to be able to say something good. The slice was so mediocre it was almost funny. The predominant taste was salt, followed closely by grease. Maybe I'm just not destined to connect to the magic of the place, but maybe there's a lot of cognitive dissonance going one.

2241,Steve C.,0.0,3,Definitely a good slice. But is it five dollars good? NoThe crust is thicker than Grimaldi's but more airy. I like Grimaldi's sauce and cheese better. They use more cheese here which was shredded into smaller pieces. And the addition of parmesan adds something interesting to the slice. Not really better but different texture to give the slice some depth.The wait here is definitely gimmicky. The store was suppose to open at 6pm but they did not open until 7pm. Once inside only one oven was used out of the six they had. Only two pies went into the oven at any one time. I can understand the old guy taking his sweet time making a pie but the younger guy moved just as slow. And all he really did was take orders and grind up some parmesan cheese. You are really paying for the pizza and a show.I didn't like the freshly cut basil just thrown on after the pizza comes out of the oven. It didn't bring out the full flavor of the herb. But that's part of the gimmick. Only the old man can grab that bunch of basil and cut it in front of a line of customers.A lot of things can and should change to make this place run more efficiently. But that's really not why you come to Di Fara. History and Atmosphere along with a pretty good slice of pizza is what they are selling.,3/21/2010,85,166,51,--KQJPdrU0Md97DiOliDzw
2242,Jack A.,0.0,5,"So here's the 459th take on DiFara Pizza and yes, I have to agree with all the four and five star reviews:Though I can't compare Di Fara pizza to Totonno's or Patsy's because I haven't tried them yet, I have to say I was mightily impressed. And let me tell you everything was working against my liking this pizza joint. How  can I put this delicately? The place is a dump. It's depressingly worn and unkempt. We're talking decrepit, plastic wall paneling aged to a greasy gold, which no doubt gathered its tarnish from the incessant waves of heat emanating from the gas ovens. The place has a sepia glower, and not even the lacquered reviews and framed newspaper articles can distract you from its 70's Guido chic décor. If you can call it decor.Shuffling behind the counter is Dominick Demarco, the proprietor of DiFara who has been honing his pizza making craft for over forty years. He takes his sweet time doing what he does best.My friend astutely remarked that Mr. DeMarco runs the pizzeria more like a hobby than a business, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing, especially since I had what was arguably the best pizza in a long while.From sweet San Marzano tomatoes imported from Naples, to the three cheeses with which Mr. DeMarco prepares his pies, fresh ingredients is the obvious secret. The sauce is a delicate, succulent blend of sweet and acid tartness, and a perfect complement to the creamy cows-milk mozzarella and Bufala that Mr. DeMarco imports from his hometown of Casserta. Still bubbling out of the oven, he completes the cheese trifecta with a blithe and generous dusting of hand-grated Grana Padano; this is followed with a drizzling of Olive Oil and snips of fresh basil.What's to say about the crust? A wafer crisp delight, charred and blistered on the edges, which I love, and best of all, it didn't buckle under the weight of the sauce/cheese on top. There was no spongy mess in the center. I was surprised such a great crust came from a gas oven when most pizza purists would prefer results from the old-fashioned wood burning kind, but gas ovens can do the job just as well when they're set to a very high temperature. Considering the vision warping heat that practically radiates from the establishment, DiFara's undoubtedly employs this method to achieve a charry edged crust with the right balance of chewiness and crunchiness throughout.I also tried a sicilian slice or as they call it, a square. It was also excellent, but a little messier to eat. It broke apart more easily and overall, I wasn't as impressed or blown away as with the regular slices. Still, the square offers a lesson on how thick dough should really be cooked - a great combination of crunchy/soft textures with its pores soaked in extra virgin olive oil. It was greasy while never feeling heavy, just delicious as hell.So there you have it. Dominick DeMarco clearly puts no heart into DiFara's run down setting. But then again, he doesn't need to when he puts all of it into the pizza.",3/19/2010,288,226,1,pB-M3lBpkdjKJnerlHfMKw

Why would you praise a pizza ""chef"" when he burns at least one half of the pie's crust on practically EVERY order he makes? ... or when he can't evenly distribute the toppings properly on any pie or slice? ... or when this Million Dollar business, cannot meet the lowest possible Health Safety Standards; they've been shut down MANY times by the Health Dept. since I've lived in NYC (over 20 years). And to top it off, the service at DiFara is unbearable... considering how much $$$$ they pull-in, their lack of organization is inexcusable. The attitude of the staff is a joke... total sense of entitlement & lacking all humility. He & his kids (who are some of the staff) act as if they're invincible -- do they take their success/fortune/customers for granted?Sure seems that way. They're just asking to lose it all!!!Anyone who has praised this rundown, dirty hole-in-the-wall over the years is clearly a sheep & believes the hype instead of forming their own opinion... all the newcomers are merely tardy sheep. Instead, *try (in no particular order) . . .1.) TWO BOOTS PIZZA (4 locations in Manhattan - 1 in Brooklyn)2.) L&B SPUMONI GARDENS (on 86th St. in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn)3.) GINO's PICCOLA PIZZA^ (on 25th Ave. in Astoria, Queens) 4.) STAR PIZZA^ (on Steinway St. in Astoria, Queens) 5.) PIZZA PLUS (on 7th Ave. in Park Slope, Brooklyn) 6.) STROMBOLI PIZZA^ (on St. Mark's on the Lower East Side) 7.) ARTICHOKE Pizza & Brewery (on E. 14th Street on L.E.S.) 8.) BROTHERS PIZZA^ (on E. Kingsbridge Rd. in the Bronx) *  these are places where you can get a quick slice to stay or go (unlike some popular favorites where you must order a whole pie).^  I haven't been to some of these establishments in quite a few years... I'm trying to watch my waistline ;-) So, who knows if they're still as great as they once were.Honorable mention: When I first arrived in NYC to attend The New School, my favorite joint was St. Mark's Pizza on 3rd Ave. near the corner of St. Mark's Place. Other than the 'infamous' Ray's on 6th Avenue, SMP was closest to my classes & very popular among college students, musicians, etc. The slices were huge, but more importantly they were to die for...

2256,Kevin M.,0.0,4,"I'm a bit of a pizza fanatic, so I decided to (finally) make the trip out to DiFara to get a taste of this $5 slice ($5 slice!!). Since it was a Saturday, I was expecting a bit of a wait.The place is small, but its got that perfect pizza place feel. The pizza is delicious. Its a lot of fun to watch him make the pizzas. He dribbles olive oil all over it before and after it goes in the oven. He even adds some extra cheese after it comes out all steaming hot, which melts right away. Its also crazy to watch him take the pies out of the over with his bare hands.Overall, the pie was good. People always ask me about my favorite place in NYC, and I always say that every place has its own unique characteristics that make comparisons impossible. DiFara's is different because it is a slice joint. Most other notable pizzeria's in NYC serve pies only, and at that, they focus mainly on thin crust with fresh mozz. DiFara's crust wasn't too thin (in fact, my biggest complaint about the pie my friend and I purchased is that the crust did not taste as fresh as I would expect; I was definitely disappointed in the crust).The sauce and cheese were delicious though. I haven't been to a place in NYC that just gobs tons of cheese on the pie, but DiFara's did just that. It was delicious.

My boyfriend and I trekked all the here via subway from Forest Hills, Queens, and since we came on a Sunday, there were service changes galore on a bunch of subway lines in Brooklyn. We definitely had to work to get our pizza.Fortunately, the wait was only 25 minutes for our slices, and we spent the time watching Domenico crank out pie after pie. We couldn't believe that he actually pulled the pizzas out of the ovens with his BARE HANDS, without a flinch. He must have no nerve endings left in his fingers!Domenico then cuts up fresh basil, which wilts immediately when it hits the bubbling pizza. More cheese is sprinkled on top. The crust is perfectly charred on the edges, and it has a great crunch with every bite. The sauce also has actual chunks of tomato...yum. But $5 for a plain slice of pizza is pretty pricey (extra toppings cost $1 each). It's definitely a great slice of pizza, but it's not anything life-changing.That being said, I would still love to come back here to try a whole pie. The Classic pie looked amazing, topped with Italian sausage, mushrooms, red peppers, red onions, and of course, fresh basil. Pies start at $28, so it's obviously a much better value, but it was just the two of us there, and we had just finished eating brunch.

2262,Brad W.,0.0,4,"Very good pizza--not just above average, but truly spectacular. It kind of gets mythicized a bit, so beware of building it up too much in your mind based on legend and glowing reviews.  If you do that, you might actually end up disappointed-- it is just pizza after all. If you go in with reasonable expectations, you might be blown away.My favorite thing about Di Fara is the care with which the ingredients are selected and the food is made. Mr. DeMarco brings in ingredients from all over the globe, including real buffalo mozzarella, and the pride with which he makes his pizza is truly something I can get behind-- if you want no-compromises, high quality food, Di Fara will not disappoint. You will also get the added bonus of watching a master craftsman at work, which is always inspiring no matter the discipline.There are tradeoffs, however. The crowds are usually large and unpleasant, the wait is usually quite long, and the atmosphere is drab (though interesting). If watching flies buzz around an elderly man making your food with his bare hands in a messy kitchen puts you off, stay away. If crowds of tourists standing shoulder to shoulder waiting for a pie (sometimes snapping pictures) puts you off, stay away (or at least be prepared). If waiting about an hour for a delicious pie puts you off, beware.

2264,Rachel A.,1.0,3,"Punished for being single. Punished for wanting just one. Punished for not being able to eat more. A single slice is $5 at Di Fara. It's not even as big as or as heavy as a slice from Artichoke. Nor is it about quality versus quantity (although many will differ). If I came here by myself, instead of getting just one slice, I would get a whole pie. When going to Di Fara, adopt the Costco mentality: pay more for more (literally).Luckily I had my gang of foodies with me. People from Queens sure can eat (and size of stomachs have nothing to do with this statement). We started with one pie (half special and half regular). The crust was thin, the sauce was soupy, and the pie was steaming hot. It doesn't get any fresher than this. I loved the taste of the sauce, the grated fresh parmesan, and the very generous addition of basil. At Di Fara you get a forrest of basil on your pizza unlike at other pizzerias where they literally give you three leaves. While the special toppings were good for bulk and the protein fix, I actually preferred the regular side of the pizza. Since the pizza slices were on the small side and thin, we decided to get a square pie. We consumed the first pie within minutes.I welcomed the square pie at Di Fara with an open mouth. I was a little disappointed that my friend ordered a special square. I had thought we were getting a regular square. Our square pizza was burnt all around the edges and could not hold the heavy toppings. Perhaps we should have waited an additional 20 minutes before diving in but with a Di Fara pizza in front of our faces and the smell of fresh pizza tempting us, it was difficult holding back. We attacked the pizza armed with plastic forks and knives, the necessary utensils needed, to get the pizza in our mouths without having everything fall on our laps or burning our fingers. Sadly, we were not able to finish the square pie. It was just too much for our bellies. The sweet smell of roasted tomatoes, fresh cheese, and aromatic basil also turned fiery. The smell of burnt crust stuck to my hair and clothes. Di Fara also got a little steamy and the steam was not from the love that Dom has for his pies.I appreciate the history behind Di Fara. I smiled as Dom made our pizza with TLC. I liked how everything was so casual and old at Di Fara. I got happy when I saw Izze soda in the fridge. I was surprised when I asked for hot peppers and one of the customers scooped me some red peppers in olive oil. I had meant for the crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't know about the fresh ones in the olive oil. It made the pizza even better. I like to torture myself with the burn. All my friends know me for saying, ""My mouth is on fire!"" But in the end, I give em three Yelp stars. I like John's and Roberta's better and I think the clam pie at Lombardi's is the best thing on Earth. I wanted to hug Dom the way I used to hug my grandpa and say goodbye.It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and we rode the subway home as the rain went pitter patter. It was hard to breathe and focus. The pizza coma was beginning and the soot smell would not go away. These were the Di Fara memories we were left with.",1/24/2010,732,1494,1730,-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA

It was just a mess of oil and ridiculously salty. Easily the saltiest pizza I've eaten EVER and I've lived in NY my entire life.I think it may have been an off day for Dom. We were told he was thinking of shutting down because they hadn't taken their traditional mid-day break. It seemed like Dom wanted to pack it in but junior didnt want to turn people away at 6pm on a Sunday so maybe the enthusiasm wasn't theremaybe I witnessed Cleveland Shaq and not Orlando/LA Shaq.I've vowed to go back at least once more since everyone is entitled to an off day but from what I experienced Di Fara Pizza may be living off the luster of pies gone by...,9/2/2010,17,79,1,lmv-Fos9GEZYhmS0WoaZJw

The pizza comes out on the burnt side most times, that is how it is meant to be. Dominick's adult children take the orders and re-supply him, Dominick is the only one making the pizzas and he is a man-machine, making pies non-stop, even though you'll probably wait about an hour for your pie, as he skillfully designs each one, it's worth the wait.

(Don't even THINK of insulting this pizza by eating it cold!)Be advised that the pizza is a little different from others - not your standard neighborhood-style pizza, but not exactly fancy-schmancy, either: in a category of its own.  A distinctive, unique, subtle smoky flavor - different from any other pizza I've tried.  Fresh basil torn from the plants on the window ledge.  Extremely oily - that's olive oil, of course - actually, I'd change that to a LITTLE less oil if I could, but who am I to argue with the Master?  Not at all a problem.The best.  Worth the trip.  (I'm happy I live in Bay Ridge, so not too far a ride for me by car.)  GO!!!!!",6/25/2015,5,117,0,WHKWw0lv9HjQAvxoy7xB_w

2283,Jim K.,0.0,4,"My ancestors, a proud line of gourmands and beer guts, used to tell tales of this man's craft, that there was a man in Brooklyn, who would first the pizza from the oven, set the tomato sauce, put it back in, then the cheese, then back in, then the toppings, then out again, and olive oil, and put it back for the 4th time.I traveled through rivers and dams, across hills and rubble in search of the holy land. The lore leading to this path promised invocation. It was meant to rekindle of the spirits, and grant eternal enlightenment.But it is no more, it is but a flicker of lightening, a dissipating fart in the wind. I saw a glimpse of what used to be the best. I saw a glimpse of the legend. But it is slowly starting to fade away as the burden of time begins to deteriorate its beauty. It was still there; the basil, the ingredients, Mr. De Marco's experienced hands.The ingredients are still fantastic. The sauce, the cheese, the meats. However, what was once the grand finale of the orchestra has became a third rate hipster's jamboree: Soggy Pizza. Yes, it was happening; Capitalism.Market is demanding faster service, so he gives it to them by putting the pizza through the oven once, instead of the traditional four. He was probably tired of hearing all the disgruntled customers complaining how long the wait was, and all those who've been stolen their spot on the line.He's an old man, trying to make people happy. And he's too old for all the rubbish. So if it gets them to shut up about the slow service, let it happen. But of course, it comes with sacrifice.It requires proper techniques to get the pizza to be crispy without burning the dough. But now with demands for a quicker turn-over, we are now left with this watery, slipper mess that could never properly live up to the golden days.It is of great regret that such popularity had to have ruined something so good.

2296,Dina B.,0.0,2,"There is a lot of buzz about this pizzeria because of the legendary owner who has been featured on TV including America's Test Kitchen where Di Fara's pizzas are touted as being the best in all of Brooklyn.  So I decided to bike ride out to Avenue J in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, and see if the hype is true.As usual there was a line - relatively short since it was a Sunday.  Instead of waiting for a custom-topped slice, I decided to have what was immediately available .... a basic pizza - no toppings.  Di Fara's ""schtick"" is to top off his pizzas with a few scissor clippings of fresh basil and to drizzle some olive oil as well.  The server then proceeded to divide the ~14 inch diameter thin pizza into 1/8th slices.    Considering it was only a 14 inch sized pizza, the slices end up being fairly small.  Price?  5$ basic+ fresh basil add $1 = $6.  That may seem reasonable..but factoring in the small size, with essentially no toppings ...it's actually  expensive.  The pizza was quite thin and soggy and it was fresh out of the oven!. How about the taste?  Its good - nothing spectacular.   I needed 2 slices to feel at all satisfied.  Grand total $13. For now I still give Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Bridge Park, the edge in terms of overall quality and value. Di Fara is now enjoying the fame due to recent media coverage featuring  the almost the mythic status of the  owner who quietly still works behind the counter making pizzas.Bottom line: For the price...the pizza should not be soggy.

We brought it home, and it was at the perfect temperature (though we kept it warm in the oven as we ate it. And we saw that it was good. Very damn good. Fresh and tasty, and I was glad to skip on even somethign like mushroom or pepperoni. Two people ate the entire thing. Which though a good thing, lets you know a lot about the size and thickness of slices. *Perhaps* the best pizza I have eaten, BUT: Crust was inconsistent - thick in some spots, but one bite might make it suddenly floppy. Also some slices might have crust that has turned to mush. Makes for sloppiness. I didn't put any toppings or seasonings on it, so I was left with a regular pizza flavor. The fresh tomatoes on it brought it up a unique notch, but other than that...cheese, oil, tomato, crust, the end.Eating leftovers an hour later (even heating them up), I was told that it wasn't very good at all. 25 bucks a pie for a few snips of basil and a charming old olive oil can? Hmm only on special occasions.Dives are overrated. Any place can look filthy with little effort. It was great, but it seems that the bad outweighed the good...which puts them at the mid-point.",1/4/2010,124,271,4,DiaxxDCg4Pd7moMLBv6dSg

The freshness just leaps off the pie. The pizza is drizzled with olive oil and fresh basil which make a delicious topping to the otherwise bare regular pie. Don't expect a loaded pie, these are very thin, perfectly crispy and unbelievably flavourful pizzas.

2305,Jeong C.,0.0,5,"Pause and take in the sights as you wait to order: old counter tops, a vintage cash register, soda that comes in glass bottles, and the aroma of a perfectly crafted pizza with the best imported ingredients. Two kinds of mozzarella, and a Gran Padano grating cheese; a splash of extra virgin olive oil to connect the cheeses and the imported Italian flour dough. Wonder at Mr. DeMarco's arms as he takes each pizza out by hand and finishes the pie with fresh cut basil and oregano (from Israel). At first glance, I was wary of the sagging slice edge, but with the first bite the flavors come together in a rich saliva-inducing bite. So much for giving negative points for soggy slices. Fortunately, the rest of the slice holds up well, equally crisp and equally chewy. If you are used to the imitation cheese used by the chain pizza places, you will definitely taste the difference. The square slice is actually better than a regular slice, unbelievably. It doesn't possess the fluffy volume that we all love and trust to fill our stomachs when we really need a calorically efficient grab-and-go lunch. Instead, the dough is a little denser, able to soak in the nuances of the olive oil in the unpretentious gas oven. Trust me, the extra money spent on the square is worth it. (One member of our group couldn't help but eat 4 squares, which is about $20 on pizza, justifying that because his gf is lactose intolerant, he cannot come back anytime soon) The most humbling part of the experience is that with DeMarco working in such close proximity to the customers, there is 100% transparency. There is no pretense at all. The pizza is prepared in front of you, and as you taste, there is a distinct difference in the taste. This difference has been identified by many discerning critics as being the ""best"" pizza in New York, but everyone is entitled to different experiences. I've lived in NYC for more than 25 years and DiFara's pizza is now the standard by which all other pizzas will be judged. Mr. DeMarco hails from a fading generation of pizza makers, which is giving way to those who surround their food with trendy decor, cooking techniques, ingredients (gold flake pizza, anyone?), etc. Take time to take a trip out to Avenue J in Midwood and experience pizza in an unpretentious, unadulterated moment in time.",1/31/2010,10,38,31,0y9klaQ4s8DZwaPonDhFbw

And yes, i would salivate every time i looked at my phone. Not really a good idea, considering Di Fara is rather a hike from my apt in Chelsea. I'm not sure if there is any place in the world worth waiting nearly 2 hours in a crowded, noisy hole-in-the-wall, except Di Fara's. The pizza was sheer PERFECTION. A word of advice: barge in, push your way to the front, and get your name on the list as fast as you possibly can. Then, make sure one person in your party (preferably the one who ordered) stands in front of the counter the entire time. If you retire to one of the dingy brown chairs at the tables, you risk being forgotten about by the overwhelmed Di Fara daughter taking orders at the counter. Yes, this happened to my friend and I, and next time i go, i'll wear my comfiest sneakers and stay glued to the floor in front of the masses. I've also learned the hard way that it's not worth ordering a slice (somehow, things took longer than if we'd had ordered a pie) -- spend a few bucks more for the pie. A sly fox of a man standing beside me in line was smart enough to call ahead to order a pie, and was lucky enough to receive his pizza after only 20 min or so of waiting.

Lucky us, lucky me for finally getting there, and lucky you when you go. With as many combinations of bread-cheese-tomato sauce that NYC has, how can one pizza be so superlatively fantastic? I dreamed about it after I ate it, I still could taste it the next day. Its like the best date in the world, ending with the sweetest kiss, so sweet you think about for days, re-imagining it, hoping to re-experience it soon. Yes THAT good. Seriously. The pizzas are oily, it is true. Dripping with olive oil actually. There is a clipping taped to the wall about a woman who lived to be 120 years old and drank a half cup of olive oil a day - and ate di Fara's like 4 times a week. I guess that's Dom's answer to that complaint. The pizza come out of the oven, and he grates Parmesan on its already bubbling mozzarella, then more olive oil, then fresh basil he snips with scissors. Its like, the olive oil sucks up all the basil and parmiggiano flavor and creates this extra layer of flavor. I couldn't even really think about the sauce until midway through slice, I was so busy experiencing the basil-parm factor. You know, if you want fast pizza, there are like 2 bazillion places you can go to. If you want true food art, slow food, communal, cared about, everything that NYC is not about, come here. Relax, enjoy, and feel lucky. I waited over an hour for one pie on the Sunday after Thanksgiving - and I NEVER, EVER wait for restaurants. But this is different.

2326,Daniel J.,0.0,5,"Hard to complain about a place where so much passion and a delightful purity of execution.This is one of the most honest business propositions I've seen: one man charges a higher-than-average amount while you wait for him to prepare your pizza personally for you. He's not fussy, but he's painstaking. Every detail clearly matters, even after 50 years mastering this repetitious trade.The resulting pizzas are truly delicious, though I concur with others who have mentioned that it might be even better with less of the drizzled oil. I am personally a GREASE LOVER, and was still a bit turned off by the quantity of oil. It made it harder to enjoy as many pieces as I really wanted to.It's charming, yet kind of annoying, that they don't do anything to really streamline the ordering and waiting process.  People who are eating in are so desperate to claim seating that they'll jump in and claim one of the very few tables, even if their pizza won't be ready for an hour. In fairness, ""it all worked out in the end,"" but maybe something as simple as a number system that gives you rank over other people who have ordered, would calm the scene a bit (and give you an idea about how long it will be until your pizza is done).I give this place 5 stars because the extreme pros for me far outweigh the annoyances.

2334,Aaron C.,0.0,4,"Plastered on the walls of the smoky interior of a little pizza joint in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn are years of praise lavishly bestowed on Domenico DeMarco, proprietor and still principal pizza preparer. Since 1964, DeMarco has stood guard over the gargantuan oven with dough in hand. So why is the joint called Di Fara when it has always been DeMarco as the stalwart pizza maven? His original business partner was named Farina, and a portmanteau of their names became the famous Di Fara. Now most people who pride themselves on NY pizza perspicacity will have much to say about Di Fara, but outside the NY circle, large as it may be, Di Fara has not reached the fame of some of the other pizza places. I theorize that this has nothing to do with the quality of the pizza, but rather on the refusal for DeMarco to scale up his operation. The pizza procuring procedure is Byzantine at best, and arriving with a guide is not a bad idea. After waiting the requisite wait in the line that forms outside the restaurant at all hours, make your way up to the counter and choose from the $5 slices or opt for a ~$30 pie. Someone, likely one of DeMarco's children, will write up your order on a scrap of paper and simply call you when it's ready. The additional wait for the pizza could take quite awhile, but you should make sure you return in time, lest your pizza be presented to another patron. $5 for a slice of pizza. Expensive, yes, but Di Fara doesn't fail to bring in the crowd. Since I didn't make the trip out to Brooklyn too often, I had a slice of the thin, a slice of the deep-dish, and another thin crust pie. While utterly delicious, the pizza was undeniably oily. And though DeMarco might be making each pie himself, there were issues with consistency. Some crust comes out burnt, some too soft. The ingredients are tossed on capriciously by hand, though I'll admit there might be some sort of strategic topping placement that I didn't perceive. As you can see, the pizza is not much to behold, and from experience, I can tell you that next morning cold Di Fara's isn't nearly as appetizing. Given the long wait, hassle of ordering, cost, and inconsistency, I can see why Di Fara is often a hit or miss for pizza pilgrims. Still, if you're comparing the best pies in town, you can't leave out Di Fara as a contender.",1/7/2010,52,158,1,9nEyzoauHnTChdghp1nmvQ

2341,Joyce C.,1.0,4,"The pizza was good, not all the way to 5 stars. I guess I had higher expectations from hearing about this place for so long. The 3 different cheeses, fresh basil, and olive oil made the slice. But I feel the crust could have been crispier or slightly thicker to support it. I will have to try the scilian next time.Was scared about the lines and expecting to go there and wait for hours and maybe not get a slice. (There's a few blogs that give pretty good advice on what times to go) I went on a Sunday (warm weather for Nov.) before they reopened for Dinner, got there at 5:30pm, found parking right away, no metered parking! Unfortunately they had a sign on their door ""No dough until 6:30pm"". Got some Dunkin Donuts nearby (Double points for the area-they had bavarian cream munchkins! Have only found those upstate).Go back around 5:45pm and see 5 people waiting outside, so I got in line (with a book and some snacks- the blogs warns you...). The guy in front of me said he went there 6 times, and they were always closed or on holiday. They finally opened an hour later, at 6:45pm, by then, there were probably about 15 people waiting (with local kids skateboarding by making fun of you and yelling ""I love $5 pizza!""). It's better to go in a group and have your friends grab a table for you while you wait at the counter, the people are rough! People were running for the tables. The first group in got the first pie right away, next guy gets his pie in about 5 minutes, then I get my plain slices. You definitely have to wait at the counter and hold your spot or the pushy local behind will try to budge you. Got the lone chair that I saved with my coat at the folding table and enjoyed my slices. (They need to get at least 2/3 more chairs in there- the place looks like it was furnished by leftover high school or cafe tables.)Note: They have a ceiling fan that was on high speed (the oven smokes a lot), that cooled off my slices very fast. I think that was the reason why I couldn't fully enjoy the slices. If it was warmer out, I would have found a stoop and eaten outside. I think the best time to go is 1/2 hour before they open, and be the 1st one in line, you'll get your pie right away.When I was finishing up my slices, the line had died down and I think it was probably only a 10-15 minute wait for a pie, most people just walked in and placed their orders right away. Maybe a Sunday evening is the best time to go?",12/5/2009,56,240,4232,1qyNuD1gnl4Gdz5_BeffIg

2345,Angie A.,0.0,2,"This place is the perfect example of hype. Basically someone declares that this is the best pizza ever and everyone else has to give it a try. Being that people are mostly sheep, all of sudden there are hour long waits and $5 a slice charge for pizza. Give me a break. I can only say that the positive reviewers are either tourists, typically eat Dominos Pizza, or just embarassed to admit that they've been scammed. On a Saturday afternoon, with the exception of myself, my brother and one other guy, everyone in the restaurant was a tourist. I'm talking dudes who wear sweaters tied over their shoulders preppy style (I didn't even know people still did that) and people who take pictures of themselves with the pizza (rolling my eyes). My brother and I ordered a round pie to go. I got a square slice while we were waiting. The square slice was average at best, totally disappointing. After about 45 minutes waiting, they tried to give my brother a burnt pie. In typical NYer fashion he said, that pie is burnt I don't want it.  We had to wait a few extra minutes but they obliged and gave him the next pie and gave the burnt pie to some poor shmucks. I will admit the pizza itself was delicious. Was it worth $5 a slice or the wait? Absolutely not! I've had better pizza locally all over NY (especially New Park in Queens). Being a foodie, I'm happy I tried it, but I would never eat here again.

2355,Michael F.,0.0,5,"When I was a kid, I had a weekend ritual with my friend Shlomo. On a Saturday afternoon, I would journey out to his house in Flatbush on the D train (at the time) all the way from Bedford Park Blvd in The Bronx. It's a LONG ride. At some point around dinner time, he and I would depart his parents' house and head to Avenue J and get falafel sandwiches, take our sandwiches over to Midwood High School stadium, and sit behind the bleachers in the aisle and chow. Then we'd smoke our really bad nickel bag of weed and head over to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Graham Theater, stoned out of our gizzards. Ah, them's were the days.Unbeknownst to me, I was walking right past pizza greatness over and over.  At that time, good NY pizza was less of a rare find than it is today. Back then even the average ""joe slice,"" as I like to refer to it (a slice you could get at any local pizza joint), was decent. No such luck today. Ray's Pizza (the real orginal one on 11th St and 6th Avenue) pretty much sucks ass and disappoints on every level, and most places just cook a million pies with a zillion ingredients and leave them splayed out behind glass for you to choose from their overly cheesed, overloaded offerings. Yech. I see those places and I walk right by.As has been previously noted, this guy has craft. The pizza is freakin' delicious. In my view, you can absolutely NOT take stars off for the wait. If you go here, you know you're waiting. It's part of the experience. There's plenty to read on the walls, with reviews and accolades taking up most of the available space. There was even a group of folks that made an evening out of it by bringing two bottles of wine and staking out two tables at the back where they were patiently waiting for their pizza. Be prepared to wait. Take the experience in and enjoy.  There's so much going on in this place that it's hard to be bored.You DO have to keep an eye on things, because Dom is not the most organized fella. Pizza maker extraordinaire, absolutely. Man with a system, definitely; but making pizzas in order is not his forte. One of my favorite moments came after we'd been waiting almost an hour, and had watched people that had ordered after us pick up their pies and leave. Dom's daughter was there helping out this particular evening, taking orders, bringing him dough for new pies, and extra ingredients for the orders that called for them. At one point she'd brought a tray of ingredients that were clearly ours and put them on the pizza table for him to use on our pizza (half sausage, half pepperoni, all onion) which  sat there for about 15 minutes, untouched.  The exchange went as follows:Dom's daughter: ""I'm really sorry, I don't know what he's doing.""Me: ""What do you mean? If YOU don't know what he's doing, we definitely don't!""Dom's daughter: ""He keeps making plain regular pies and forgetting to put the extra ingredients on them.""She shook her head and went in back. Soon enough Dom grabbed the tray of ingredients and put them on our future pizza.The pizza, when it finally arrived, one hour and twenty minutes after we'd walked in, was spiritual. Unfortunately, my half of it (I eat kind of fast) was consumed within about 7 minutes of arrival.  The crust is sublime, the sauce delicious, and the confluence of cheeses, all melted together is unparalleled.A few of observations (some new, some retreads):1. It's absolutely retarded to point out the decor or the cleanliness of this restaurant. If you want sterile, steel counter pizza, go elsewhere.  This place hasn't changed in 45 years and it's good, just like it is.2. I loved that, on the menu above the pizza table (and the old cash register that sits apparently unused and broken with the drawer wide open) it says:PIZZA SLICESREGULAR OR SQUARE               4.00and RIGHT underneath that:REGULER OR SQUARE               5.00(with toppings)You can't buy that kind of cool. REGULER. It's fantastic.3. Proof that Darwinism has gone horribly awry with regard to humans (this has been pointed out, but I have to repeat it because it's so unreal):People actually do show up to this place for SLICES. In case you didn't notice, the prices for slices are clearly designed to dissuade you from ordering them. In my view, you need to be relieved of your privileges as a human if you do this. The idea that you would show up for a slice is completely unfathomable. If you are reading this and have done it, please, PRETTY PLEASE, find a painless way of taking your own life. Soon. This is clearly just one of the more minor manifestations of your abject stupidity, and you need shuffle off this mortal coil before you hurt someone with actual brains by accident. I'm serious. Help the human race, off yourself.Just sayin'.Go eat Di Fara while this guy is still cranking out pies. It's more than worth the trip.",5/15/2010Previous review,519,391,85,azupW8UYwIzcFGchoEz-Dg

2357,Scott R.,0.0,5,"There are plenty of reviews that have been written canonizing this pizza.  And a few that provide the inevitable backlash/contrarian view to combat all the hype.  This review aims to use the elements of the Di Fara experience as ingredients towards a larger contemplation of man's quest for perfection - consider it an homage to Dom's attempt to honor his fantastic ingredients via his pizza-making.....except with infinitely more pretentiousness (extra cheese?) and infinitely less virtuosity (canned sauce).""What is the price of perfection?"" I ponder during my long wait for receiving one man's (a spry, near septuagenarian Dom Demarco) attempt at creating perfection within an edible 15 inch circle of tomato, cheese(s), and dough.  Now this isn't my initial thought, mind you.  I entered with my heart a-thumpin' as I finally found myself at the oft-proclaimed best pizzeria  in New York.  My initial thoughts vacillate between: 1) an internal loop of ""I'm gonna have Di Fara pizza"" that resembles both Eddie Murphy's old ""I have some ice cream"" stand-up bit and commercial pleadings of cartoon dogs for Snausages and Kibbles & Bits2) concern over whether the wait will drive the rest of my family crazy (My cousin had a party about 2 miles away and, after hearing how excited I was about the pizza, my mom, dad, 2 sisters, and sister's fiancee decide to join me in the experience).These pragmatic concerns are taken care of by the key decision (after 30 minutes of waiting) to take 6 slices (1 for each of us) in lieu of our first pie (I had ordered a 2nd pie to go).  The slice was great but too complex to make any grand assessment of it.  I'm left longing for another slice as I bid adieu to my family who head back to the land of malls and hair spray (NJ).As I wait for my pie to go, I start to take in my surroundings. There's nothing fancy or romantic about the place - the only thing distinguishing it vs other northeastern pizza joints are the various framed articles touting Di Fara.  (Not that other pizza places don't toot their own horn - if I had a nickel for every pizza box I've seen with the 'You've tried the rest.  Now try the best' line.  At least Di Fara employs third-party assessments...).  But this place is different in two key ways:1) There isn't a dough-slinger or chef behind the counter - there's an artisan.  You can tell it in the way Dom grates the buffalo mozzarella onto each pie (vs. having the bucket of grated mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on).  Or the way he chops basil and grates another type of cheese (grana padana) to top off the finished pie as classical music plays in the background.                2) There isn't a line of customers waiting for a pie or some slices.  There is chaos. Perhaps due to naivete, I pictured the wait for a Di Fara pie to be a communal experience.  People bonded together for one common objective --- sharing a mutual respect...yadda yadda yadda.  But I'm not seeing a lot of that.  Whatever positive motivations everyone brought to the pizzeria have all but disappeared thanks to the long wait and the infuriating lack of an equitable ordering system. And it's this yin/yang battle separated by a pizza counter that gets me thinking about the price of perfection.  Watching Dom apply his craft is a treat and I can only hope he finds inner peace and tranquility in it.  But the desperation, conflict, and opportunism (people try and often succeed at getting their pie before others) on the other side of the counter feel like a microcosm of other quests for perfection.  Blood diamonds (perfect jewel).  Ethnic cleansing (perfect race), Enron (perfect scam). Steroids (perfect male body).  Eating disorders (perfect female body), The unnecessary zaniness that Balky inflicted on Cousin Larry (perfect strangers), etc.  Is the quest for perfection - even one much more noble than all the above examples - ever worth the cost?After probably 60 minutes of such philosophizing (on top of the earlier 30 minutes), I finally get my pie and can find out whether the pizza truly is worth it.  The first slice is fantastic.  The interplay of the two cheeses has such a sharp, rich taste to it.  The San Marzano tomatoes taste so rustic and earthy.  The basil complements both the cheese and tomatoes.  The crust has a great char to it.  It's like no slice I've had before.  Another slice confirms the assessment --- this could very well be the best pizza I've ever had.But I'm still not totally satisfied.  I don't know if it was the hype, the wait, self-inflicted nihilism or a bit of all three but this odyssey didn't end up being about a search for the best pizza --- it became about a search for the perfect pizza.  And perfection is too much to ask of anyone - even Dom.",7/3/2015,311,784,12,YXMiSBrLNcnbxnfMK4BVug
2358,Becca S.,0.0,3,"In general, I think most New Yorkers would agree that our image of being rude, obnoxious, self-important assholes couldn't be farther from the truth, and that we are, overall, quite polite and nice.  However, when it comes to Di Fara's, all bets are off.  When we arrived yesterday at 5:15 Dom was just locking the door, posting a sign in the window that said ""Open at 6"".  At 5:45 they changed the opening time to 6:20.  At 6:30 they still hadn't opened the door, but they let people place their orders at the window, presumably to get a head start.  Great, we think to ourselves, our pizza will be ready when we get in!  OMG LOL BEST JOKE EVER!At 6:45 the door finally opened, and it was then that the gloves came off.  All the nice people who for the last hour and a half had stood patiently in line chatting amiably with their neighbors rushed in and filled the small space in front of the pizza counter with no regard to who had been ahead of whom in line. We were lucky enough to get a table and chairs, but J's sister in-law nearly got into a bona fide cat fight with a woman who adamantly maintained that we were obligated to let her have one of our chairs since J's brother was up retrieving our pizza.  We politely disagreed to such a social contract, and she then proceeded to bitch loudly about us for the next 15 minutes. When we grew so tired of listening to her that we finally relinquished our chair on the condition we get it back upon the arrival of our pizza, she continued to berate us for not giving it up sooner.We got our first pizza just after 7:30, and yes, it was delicious, but 2 and a half hours delicious? I'm not sure anything is.  A sneaky and evil old man STOLE our second pizza, but we managed to get the next one that came out, and that was quite good too.   As we left, we saw two groups begin to argue about who had been waiting longer for our seats, and others pushing and shoving to get to the front of the counter space.  Honestly, the whole experience was some of the ugliest human behavior I've seen in a long time, and I was genuinely sad witnessing the levels people were willing to stoop to.  It's pizza, people!  A little perspective, please!Pizza alone:  5 starsEverything else:  0 stars",2/11/2007,264,300,69,DJHAt1ldC3-1UIxt1xJQPw

I promise you, it's an Ipecac serum for me.I've heard the hype. I just never had an opportunity to try the legendary Di Fara pizza. The first time I went to Di Fara's I tried, excuse me, waited for the pizza, was Gina C's birthday. I thought I would bring an interesting gift.I kicked myself as I waited over an hour for one regular and one Sicilian pie. As pies came out, I became angry because I thought it was MY pie coming out of the oven. I thought about mugging the losers who got their pies before me.Then Dom smiled at me. He sprinkled more cheese, drizzled olive oil on my pies, and cut them. I paid him. The other worker locked the door. It was closing time. I was so famished, I opened the boxes and swallowed a slice from each. I gathered my belongings took my pies and thanked Dom. He was surprised and smiled when I told him, it was my first time.I was happy to share the pizza with the party guests and realized that it was worth the wait and a great present. I could only be trumped if someone brought a drunk clown or a unicorn (Ironically, I think someone did bring a drunk clown - J.W.)Anyone who understands finance, always considers calculating the time value of money... with Present Value greater than $4, I am not sure I can afford paying this much for this pizza per slice (the travel time + wait time + price) often. I think it's worth waiting for once in your life.However this is the most delicious pizza I have ever eaten. I didn't like the Sicilian so much. I will concur, it's the best in NYC.

2362,victoria v.,0.0,4,"WHY WHY WHY?Waiting two hours for a slice? I'll tell you why.It is god damn good. mmmhmmm. Can I tell you about the cheeses? Three (I think) different generously portioned cheeses bless this pie, along with fresh tomato chunks hand scissored basil and perfect slightly tangy and doughy (if not a lil burnt) crust.I am awed. Clearly 5 stars for the pizza. BUT the wait. Fuck me, it is torture. And the poor (??) second in charge to Domenico was just doing a bad job keeping up with his own scribbled notes as to who was next and what was ordered. This is bad. Very bad business. This place could stand a little organization. And, um...a cleaning staff. And, um, some health regulations that are actually in practice. I know, it's crazy -- but the overall experience here, tonight with my pizza companions S.V., S.V., A.I. and A.S. was a 3 star. If we got our pie in under two hours...I could give them the 5 their pizza deserves. SIDE NOTE: I had no clue, that in my youth, I had had Di Fara's many times, as my grandparents lived a block away up until my grandma passed away two years ago.

2364,Jimmy S.,0.0,5,"Last week, a bunch of us got together to watch the NBA playoffs and we ended up picking up some pies from Di Fara. My Wizards went on to beat down the Cavs by 30 points and we ended up getting 4 pies: 1 plain, 1 porcini, 1 pepperoni, and 1 sausage. First of all, I HATE pepperoni like it stole family property. The kind you get from Papa Johns and Pizza Hut are always salty, greasy, and crunchy at the same time. How do they get that way? You gotta try to get anything to suck as bad as the pepperoni does at most places. Alas, I suffer in silence whenever I have to get pizza with friends. People get surprisingly pissed off when you criticize their favorite toppings. The loneliness of this pizza-topping stigma has followed me my whole life.This pepperoni that Dom uses was unbelievable. Chewy, thick and shaped like a tire instead of a frisbee. Not too salty. Not too greasy. It was amazing. I loved this slice of pepperoni so much. In fact, this slice challenged every preconceived notion I had about pepperoni. It shook my fragile id to it's very core. In a delicious way.  All of the toppings were fantastic. The porcini was great and so was the sausage.  All of the toppings were sliced surprisingly thick but none of them were overpowering. The blend of 3 cheeses was the proverbial MVP and the oil and basil were nominated for the 6th man of the year award only to lose in an extremely close contest to the handmade crust. This was, by far, the best pizza I have ever had.  So if there are any other pepperoni haters out there who read this review, you don't have to suffer any longer. Please, get a pepperoni pie from Di Fara. You owe it to yourself.",4/26/2008,123,122,36,CYd9M0nM9V8GGX3b48jAMA
2365,Melanie C.,0.0,4,I had a friend take me here who grew up in the neighborhood eating their pizza.  It's not a fancy place by any means but the pizza is out of this world!  The ingredients are fresh and you'll see this when you watch them make your pie.  The olive oil they use is superb.  Make sure to ask for basil on your pizza - it makes a difference.,1/2/2013,563,18,0,tsXoQgB5oHj1oc0rxGl7Fw
2366,Susan N.,0.0,2,I recently saw a show where restaurant patrons visited a restaurant with fairly inexpensive meals with non-fancy sounding names and a restaurant with higher priced items and dishes with fancy sounding names.  The patrons at the latter place gave much higher ratings to their meals than those that visited the former.  The catch?  Both restaurants served the exact same thing.  People at the fancier sounding place rated their meals more highly because they followed the group dynamic and felt that's what was expected of them.That's DiFara for you.  The slices are fine.  Not amazing.  Not bad.  Certainly not worth the ridiculously long wait.  And certainly not worth the $5 the old man has now started charging.  $5 a slice?  Are you kidding me?  I guess it's NY and the old guy is smart.  He knows there's a sucker born every minute and willing to pay.  Now what should be my scheme to sucker all the faux New Yorkers into giving me their money...?  ;-),8/3/2009,284,570,22,LVhWEqGNnk8VQI1hw_zV0A
2367,Nicholas T.,0.0,1,"I love DiFara's pizza, but I don't honestly see how anyone in their right mind is willing to suffer through a 2+ hour wait to get it.Here's the thing: the first time I went, the wait wasn't too bad.  It was a few years back, before all of the hype.  The slices I got were decent, not bad.  The plain slices were good, and the ""special"" slice with the broccoli rabe was excellent.  It was a bit of a trek, but I figured I'd be back - and it was a great stop-off on the way to the beach.  Ok, count me in.Fast forward a few years, to last year.  I've been going less and less each year, as its popularity goes up and the lines get longer and longer.  I order my pie and get it, and you know what?  It's good, but it's a little too salty, and sitting is impossible so we bring it back to my apartment to eat and by then it's a little cold, and this after we spent well over an hour waiting to order it, watching him make it, stressing over whether he'd remember our order or if that girl on the side was going to try to sneak in front of us or why the hell we were there... the pizza was still good, even if it was a little too salty and a little cold and I definitely loved eating it.  But you know, it's just not worth it any more.I'll let other people wax rhapsodic over how great Dom is - and they're right - and about how he grows his own basil in the window or how he prepares each pie with the utmost of care and everything is done by hand and whatever else.  It's all true.  The problem is that in the end, all you're getting is a great pie, and there's no question that there's a lot of value to a great pie, but I'd much rather wait 10 minutes to score a slice of ""the 2nd best in the world"" pizza rather than wait 2 hours for a slice of ""the best in the world"" pizza.  Dom has his bad days, and honestly, waiting in line to get the pizza is boring and frustrating and a little stressful and... well, look, if you want to wait in line, fine, but I'm avoiding it, and you would be wise to as well.(And hopefully, just hopefully, the hype will die down again and then I can go back to visiting good ol' Dom and his fantastic pies...  If you care, Yelpers, if you truly care - vote this mofo down so that those of us that really know and don't need to rely on the Yelp review can go in peace.  Do it for the children!)",1/30/2007,76,46,2,BlVe_TjlYFGEGDdgoq7uow
2368,C M.,0.0,2,"The constantly notoriety and mentioning of the marquis establishment owned by one Domenico De Marco deserves a much delayed pilgrimage in the most sought after, best pizza in the 5 boroughs.I arrived at Di Fara's Pizzeria at 7:00pm on a Wednesday evening (as I live about 10 minutes away) and found the place to have less occupancy than expected.  There is no need to mention anything about the décor except for the follow description illustrated by my friend Vinny...""The place looks like a freakin bomb went off in it.  Then the place was fixed up really nice, and then another bomb went off inside it.  That's what you have today"".Couldn't help but laugh when first envisioning his statements and then applying it to the actual apparatus.  Expect nothing of the décor other than this being another hole in the wall type place that serves high recognized Pizza.My friend George and I opted to order the traditional round pie, no toppings.  There were approximately 10 patrons in front of us so the wait was going to be about 45 minutes.  Luckily, we managed to find a seat.  As the minutes slowly passed, we saw the numerous amounts of patrons, put in their order, leave, and come back to either pick up or dine in.*Note to future patrons...  Di Fara's allows for call ins ahead of time for pick up or dine ins.  Time wisely, and this can be a painless process.Finally... After 45 minutes of waiting and watching, Master De Marco presents us with 1 of his 300 daily produced pizzas!The application of the pizza was extremely simple...Master Da Marco starts the application with flattening a piece of Imported Italian Flour Dough to form a 1/8"" crust.  The flattened dough is then coated with an evenly distributed amount of San Marzano Tomato Sauce that nicely coats the dough, but doesn't drench it.  The last step prior to baking is to have a cheese application on top of the sauce.  From my observation, the cheese consists of three different types.  I was only able to determine that one from the mix of cheeses used was of course, Fresh Mozzarella.  The Pizza is then put into a 650 degree oven for baking @ approximately 20 - 25 minutes.  Upon retrieve, the bubbling cheese and steam generated by this application is highly noticed and produces watering of every salivary gland on the tongue.  The pizza is finally finished off a heavy coating of grated Pecorino Romano, chopped Fresh Basil (Master Da Marco holds the Basil stems and cuts it with blue scissors), and a heavy drenching of Imported Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil.Let the feast begin...When first retrieving the Pizza, there is only one thing that comes to mind...WHY THE HECK IS THERE SO MUCH EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL ON THIS PIZZA!?!?!Seriously...  The excess application of the EVOO distorted and mangled the well baked crust of this pizza.  In fact, the excessive amounts of EVOO used, caused the pizza is become slimy, and thus, had to be eating with two hands, even when folded.  I must admit, deciphering the Pizza itself was the most challenging part as the EVOO overwhelmed every bite of Pizza!  Despite trying to hang dry the pizza by letting the EVOO drizzle off, the taste itself was still distorted and rejecting.  After constant attempts, I was able to achieve a singular bite that allowed for the appreciation of the various flavors used in the application.  It was evident with this one bite that Master De Marco's use of the Imported Italian Flour, San Marzano Tomato, and Three Cheese Application was well put in creating a robust taste.  The delicate nature of the dough crust worked well with the richness of the San Marzano Tomato sauce, which opened the gates to the fluffy yet heartiness of the cheese.  Of course, this observation only came from one bite of Pizza as the rest of the time was spent wondering where Master Da Marco gets his EVOO from since there was must a sale going on if he's using this much!After about 2 slices, the excess EVOO finally took its toll, and the pizza became more Burdensome Corpulent rather than Flattering and Humbling.  I opted to finish off my remaining 2 slices just so there would be no leftovers.After the final bite, the overwhelming application did not produce any feelings other than the excessive burden that was placed before me in having to consume so much EVOO during one sitting.  I seriously kid you not when I state with certainty that Master De Marco could've filled a 6oz cup with the amount he used on the Pizza.I've deliberated with numerous previous patrons of Di Fara's and they've confirmed that the excessive oil is De Marco's signature application...Think it's wise if I go back and ask Master De Marco to go light on the EVOO?  I'm tempted to take on such a task but I need not have a Soup Nazi incident nor have my butt whooped for having offended the legendary Avenue J master.Of course...  I will ask for less EVOO to be used in the application.  Thus setting up my future update review.",11/6/2008,266,454,791,mQr4popcpi9E_hIIJ8Wumg
2369,Ahu S.,0.0,5,"Growing up, our family had our favorite place that made the best pizza ever. About once a month we would order from there - and boy did we look forward to those nights, because this was the best pizza....ever! We ordered this pizza again while I was visiting California, and I realized, Mike's Pizza has officially fallen from grace.Di Fara's has taken the #1 spot in my heart. The ingredients are all extremely simple and of the utmost quality. This makes for a great pie. But what really pushes it over the top is that grana padano cheese. I have asked at every cheese counter in the city about this cheese, and none of them have it! It gives the pizza a tangy, tasty, delicious finish.The first time I went, my friend and I (both newbies to Di Fara) were so starved by the time our pizza was ready, we gobbled the slices down like they were the last slices on earth. Standing in Dom's workshop for an hour with the delicious scents twisting in our noses while we waited was pure torture... and finally we were rewarded with our circular prize.I can say, without hesitation, that this is the best pizza I've ever had. The only thing that makes me sad is that Dom won't be around forever, and it seems that there is nobody to carry on his craft!Go here for the best pizza ever!!!",3/26/2008,122,450,87,6JeTO9iBoblsgaH47biypA

2373,Tommy F.,0.0,1,"OVERRATED!!!! OVERRATED!!!! Okay I know this not a popular opinion, but it is the truth. Most of the reviewers here are blinded by the fact they have to validate spending 3 hours waiting for Pizza. Now I can appreciate a true artist, but let's be serious here. I have been here on 3 separate occasions and I have walked away disappointed all 3 times. It is about time we bring some true objectivity to this board.Let me break it down here:FoodFood is #1. After waiting 1.5 hours for a pie and slice on multiple occassions,  I was seriously not impressed with the limp and greasy slice I received. While the ingredients are probably top notched, Dom failed to really bring it all together. One of the slices I received was not cooked crispy enough. It fell apart instantly under the heat of the cheese and sauce.  ServiceAnybody that is truly objective here can see that the system is insane. You walk in there and there are no lines or any system for that matter. I am used to disorder and chaos growing up eating and shopping in Chinatowns in NYC. I would rather deal with that then this chaos. I stood at the counter and watched Dom do everything. While that is admirable, it also is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. He has to flip the dough, sauce the pizza, drop the cheese, and put it in the oven. He even needs to be the one to cut the Basil and slice the pizza. Let's be honest guys. A monkey can cut the basil and slice the pizza. The reason I bring this insanity up is that by having him do all of these steps, the pizza is backed up for hours and as a result the food is inconsistent. Yes that seems crazy, but I saw how the intensity of the crowds start to push Dom and as a result things get all out of whack for him. Cooking times for pies are varied, orders get mixed. etc. I am sure the food at one point was great. However my experience was surely less than stellar. It was not once, but 3 times. Twice by myself and once with a group that wanted to drag me there based on bad reviews such as the ones on this board. Please open your eyes and think objectively for once Yelpers!!",5/18/2008,3,10,1,gH8HmCR595ouReQesMhU-A

Well, he doesn't wear a white robe or have a fluffy white beard or float on clouds or anything that you'd normally consider to be godly, but he does preform miracles---edible miracles. And that's enough to make him a god, isn't it?The first bite of a pie from DiFara Pizzeria is a revelation that you've just had an epiphany; you've just seen a true master, THE god of all things pizza-y. Everyone that loves pizza should build churches, write a bible, and bow down and worship him. Its like you've just taken a peek into heaven, almost like when you were a kid and you found where your parents hid the christmas presents and realized there is no Santa, you'll see that there is no ""pizza"" other than his, its all a farce. You'll be floored. Hell, I was floored. I didn't want to stop chewing the first bite. By now everyone has covered how he does it. I mean, you'll see how he does it... about 30 times before you see how he does yours. But its worth it. Its a one-man show on the train to pizza-deliverance (deliverance in the going to heaven sense, bible stuff... all that jazz).This pizza will change your life.It changed mine.

2375,Frank W.,0.0,5,"I love the fact that Di Fara takes his time snipping basil with his scissors, shaving the cheese, and drizzling olive oil on each one as if he was making pizza for the first time.  The expression on his face when he looks in the oven to check on the pies reminds me of the one my Dad had when he would make us lunch.  He took more time to cook than my Mom, but things were always delicious.They take a while to take your order here, but Di Fara's daughter is very pleasant and there are plenty of neighborhood characters to entertain you.  But I also got a laugh watching the pained expressions of the Blackberried classes eager to just get their slice and check this place off their to do list.I was incredibly hungry myself, but a nice guy shared some zucchini flowers with me, which were quite tatsy and can tide you over while waiting for pizza.  As the wait went on, one regular joked about two pictures of Dominick Di Fara hanging on the wall, one of a younger Dom from the 50's, and another from the 80s.  ""That first one's of Dom when he opened the restaurant, and the other one is when he finished his first pie!""  Even Dom's daughter laughed heartily.  Minutes later a little girl from the neighborhood brought in a crayon drawing of dom holding a big wood peel pizza turner, and presented it to a smiling Dom.  I was glad I had the time to see it all.After an hour of ""theater"", my mushroom slice was ready and it was the most delicious slice I had ever eaten, until I started eating my plain cheese square, which had just a bit more of Di Fara's delicious cheese and sauce, and a bit more charred flavor from the oven.  I hope Di Fara passes on his skills, so this place will be here for years to come, but I suspect that even though he doesn't allow his kids to touch the pies, they have seen his painstaking process so many times that they could do it in their sleep. In fact I have no doubt that they have dreams of their Father making his pies.",10/7/2007,190,307,14,zR2iAdGWaqN2dq4O-jBZBA

2379,John M.,0.0,5,"I keep swearing never to return. It's quite the ordeal: an hour to get there and this time a 1 ¾ hour wait for a couple of little slices, all gone in a few bites. The wait is far from pleasant, what with all the uncontrolled chaos in the packed, sweltering dive. Worse, being given to persecutory ideation, I'm convinced that people who order after I do often get served before I do. And while I can appreciate watching the master craftsman at work (in slow motion), it also disturbs me to see a poor elderly man slaving over a scorching pizza oven all day, hardly how I'd choose to spend my golden years.All of which is to say, Di Fara has a huge hurdle to overcome; it overcomes it handily. What's remarkable isn't how much better it is than the typical pizzeria, but how much better it is than the best of them. For instance, L&B gets a nice sweet flavor in its renowned square pie, yet sweet is the one dimension. Di Fara's taste is far more complex, with (at least) sweet, savory and lactic notes, like the best Italian restaurant food. Suffice it to say this isn't a place where you start sprinkling all the dried seasonings before even tasting your food. The fine ingredients explain only part of what makes it special. Many places chop in fresh basil these days and some purport to use San Marzano tomatoes, but none gets this flavor. One huge difference I notice here is that there aren't separate layers of dough, sauce and cheese; it all somehow melds into one. Another is that Dom isn't afraid to char the crust. Other places will make the pizza hot (if you beg), but never really well done. Anyway, I guess I'll be back next year.",6/27/2014,4,132,6,J2bQNhAlmNfd-_JxddaHmw

2382,Haley W.,0.0,2,"It was a rather dull Sunday evening.  After nearly overdosing on the DVD of ""The Office"" (BBC version of course), my man and I thought ""Why not walk over to Di Fara?""  It's in my hood and we needed to get off our asses, so we decided to give it a shot.  The time was then 6:30 pm (this note of time is actually quite important).We get to the joint about 15 minutes later, after a romantic stroll through Ditmas Park/Midwood, only to find a not-so-romantic queue about 25 people strong.  Rather intimidating.  If I didn't have a calming cig-buzz I would probably have turned around right then and headed down the block to ""Brooklyn's Best Kosher Pizza"" and just imagined it was the same thing.  The place is dingy.  Peachy-orange walls, caked tiles, and dust piled on top of the picture frames (most of which are articles praising this modern day mecca of pizza).  It takes about 30 minutes for us to actually be far up enough in the line to  SEE the man behind the magic, ""Dom.""  My first thought is, ""Good God, how old is this guy?""He moves slowly, or as my southern mama would say ""like molasses runnin' uphill in January.""  He hunches over, and squints to see how thickly he grates the fresh mozz over his meticulously shaped and slapped dough.  He has this young whippersnapper assistant who I am convinced does absolutely nothing.  He just keeps disappearing to the back room to ""make sauce.""  The good thing about Dom being so slow, is that I now know exactly how to make my own Di Fara pie, right down to the number of grates of cheese and exact drizzle of olive oil.  I rather enjoyed watching him make his pie....but after a while I was debating whether or not his adamant need to make every pie himself was really sweet and cute or just plain effin' ridiculous.  45 minutes passed, and, after having my hand slapped when reaching for someone's leftover crust, I had to restrain myself from shouting ""Dom!!!  For fuck's sake!!!  Hire some FAST, NIMBLE HANDS!!!!  THE PEOPLE MUST EAT!!!""  Maybe if I had just eaten some shrooms I would have seen his slow-moving, old world solo pizza making routine perfectly nostalgic and spiritual, but in 2007 I must say that it's stupid.  The upper west siders behind me must have been on drugs though, as they said stuff like ""Wow.  He must have a lot of patience.  Just look at his method. He's like the Dalai Lama or something.""  (This is where I snorted and nearly choked on a stolen crumble of fresh parm).  No.  He is not the Italian version of His Holiness .  He is an old man who needs to retire and let that little useless assistant of his actually do some work.Hm.  Negative tirade aside, I must say the pizza was pretty damn good when we finally got home (at 9:30, mind you) and sat down to eat accompanied by more episodes of ""The Office.""  The mixture of cheeses is by far the best I've ever had.  But the wait is definitely not worth it.",1/22/2007,176,54,1,-NED65lEaSVeDVXyJrtqTg

A.,0.0,3,"I'm Brooklyn born and raised...I went to Midwood H.S and Brooklyn College so I'm very familiar with the area, but more importantly I'm very familiar with what a great tasting slice is all about. I've been to DiFara's about 10 times, and I must say that this joint is truly hit-or-miss. Sadly, more misses than home runs. When the pizza is done right, I mean OMG it's insanely awesome...flavors abound and you're thirsting for more. I believe the square pie is superior to the round when all things are equal, but I did have a food-gasm once on a round pie...it was perfection: wasn't soggy and it was just a thing of beauty to eat. However, the round pies are usually on the soggy/watery side and when this occurs you wished you had not wasted upwards of 1+ hours for your food. I'd say your chances on getting a perfect round pie is about 20%. As mentioned, I love the square pie and the chances of getting a great square is about 85%...sometimes the bottom can be ""too charred"" for my liking. If you have 2 hours to burn and want to take your chances on getting a great pizza...do it! Just know that it sucks to wait soo long for something that cost more than normal for pizza that is at times sub par. I guarantee you will be thinking about why Dom hasn't changed his ways and hires some nice Italian guys to crank out more pizzas under his tutelage. The fact that he makes each pie to order is a nice novelty that wears very thin after 30 minutes of waiting. Just some food for thought...  Bon appetite!",11/3/2011,8,40,0,zaTdM7SHmBi5ckYanCcwnw

2385,Bryna M.,0.0,5,"Just so everyone in San Francisco doesn't think I'm a stingy pizza reviewing bee-atch, I'll pen an ode to the best pizza man ever, my hero, the one and only Domenico DeMarco the proprietor of DiFara's on Avenue J, smack dap in the center of Brooklyn.Dom is amazing and at almost 80 years old he hand makes every single pie at DiFara's today, just the way he has for almost 50 years.  He uses tomatoes he imports himself from his home region in Italy.  He sprinkles each pie with a combo of three high quality cheese - regular semi hard mozzarella, fresh mozzarella and parmesan.  He make two kinds of pies - square and regular.  He offers only a few toppings and they are prepared to order.  When you order a sausage slice, he or a helper goes to the back and slices sausage for your pizza.  The special toppings are artichoke and porcini mushroom - Dom claims to import these things himself.  They are expensive but when you order an artichoke slice you have more artichokes than pizza on your plate and it's worth every penny.  My presonal favorites are sausage (nice and fennel-ly) and the peppers/onions/mushroom combo.  I also always get at least one square and one regular and have been known to eat 4 slices in one visit.Going to DiFara's is like making a pilgrimage.  Since it's only Dom making pies it's a slow process, he makes every pie to order and he's so busy that the pies for slices don't last long.  So every slice is almost fresh out of the oven.  The slowness really gets to some people but I love it.  It means that I get to watch Dom work and that is a beautiful thing.  He is a master at his craft, he creates every pie with love and tenderness, he moves with grace and harmony.  Watching him make pizza is like watching art in motion.  Dom knows all his regulars.  He even remembered me after a nine month absensce.  When I told him I went to Africa, he asked me if I ate pizza in Africa.  When I said yes, he said we'll probably not like this and he was right.  When I said i was moving to California, he said that's too bad he heard that they don't have good pizza there.  And so far he's right.",9/10/2008Previous review,6,30,3,DObB0OeZFzTsYGpoB8ohQA
2386,Marcus D.,0.0,2,"The world has gone mad.Me and my buddy were in here today.  First off, we made the mistake of ordering a slice and a square - we later changed it TWENTY FIVE MINUTES later when we got the slice but the squares were going to be a bit longer, where we said, ""we'll just take two slices, please.""While we waited, we downed root beers, watched the smoke belch from the oven, and the old man lovingly create a pizza out of nothingness.  Yes, very nice.  There wasn't a huge crowd in the place, the usual suspects, guys in sweatsuits and Tap Out shirts - I could have been in East Boston. The next clue in this adventure should have been when the beautiful Jewess came sweeping in from the street, her big tortoise-shell framed sunglasses shielding half her face, and she ordered a square, GOT IT, and walked past us.  I glimpsed the square - it was a hacked up looking square filled with oily tomato sauce, so oily you could sail a ship on it - the slices, I will say, were not oily, but I digress. The crowd in here was a bit over the top (hence the hot Jewess), but then again so is this part of the world - and my family is from Borough Park, go figure.  One smart ass was in the background saying, ""Alright, who is the virgin to Di Fara's.""  I don't think he was talking to me, and if he asked me that after I actually ate my two slices I would have said, ""yes, we all remember the first time we've been F'ed.""As I said, the pizza is made from scratch.  Also, the fresh basil is a nice touch, cut with gigantic scissors, and the pie is slightly well done, which I like, and the crust was delicious, but for five bucks a slice and nearly a half hour of waiting, well, let's just say that Spumoni Gardens has it all over this place.It's Brooklyn, people, and it's pizza, calm down.  Going out for a slice shouldn't be an EVENT!",7/8/2006,40,667,0,8eQ7LmOK6KeSRXq_o8KaAw

Just like in Seinfeld where people waited patiently in line , people from all over Brooklyn and beyond come to see Domenico De Marco work on his pies like some great artist. He is such a nice man who works diligently on our pie...usually he works on four or five at a time. He has fresh ingredients which he grows himself and also orders from his hometown in a small city in Italy. When your pizza is done, he slaps it down into the box, but before he closes it he adds some olive oil, extra cheese and snips some pieces of fresh basil to add even more flavor to an already delicious looking pie.

2388,Michelle T.,0.0,5,"More from NYC:Today was wet and drizzly, and it took me almost an hour to get from the Lower East Side to the pizza mecca that is Di Fara.  This unassuming, age-worn pizzeria sits just outside the grafitti-splashed Avenue J station in Brooklyn -- and despite its peeling brown paint and weathered, washed-out signage, the wafting smell of pizza goodness can't be resisted.  Nor, for that matter, can its reputation as one of the best pizzerias in the country.As expected, Domenico De Marco -- the maestro -- was personally, patiently and carefully hand-crafting each pizza one by one, just as he's done for four decades.  He never looked up, keeping his head down and focused on his craft while his daughter Margaret took orders at the counter (and occasionally hand-cranked the cheese grater). The three small tables in the cramped space were already occupied, and I could see that there were lots of pies on the list that hadn't yet been made, so I ended up ordering a couple of slices of the regular pie rather than waiting.  They were delicious and hot -- fresh from the gas-fired oven.  (Who says you need a wood-burning oven to make fantastic pizza?)  I can't say enough about the wafer-thin crust -- the texture was perfectly charred and crisp.  The simple toppings of tomato sauce, cheese and basil leaves were fresh and tasty, and a glistening sheen of olive oil added to the mouth-filling flavor of the slices I devoured.Although the pizzas are pricey even for New York (e.g., $4 per slice, $20 for a regular pie, $25 for a ""square"" pie baked in a well-seasoned pan, $28 for the Di Fara special pie with mushrooms, peppers, sausage and onions), the pizza here is worth every penny (as well as an interminable subway ride from Manhattan).Plus, who can resist the allure of a chef so dedicated and passionate about his cooking that he insists on personally making every single item that comes out of his kitchen?  (See, e.g., Chef Chia-Ji Nei of Jai Yun in San Francisco.)",6/9/2008,87,148,50,a7T5K2HfQ_EfCUXRhlrLLQ

2393,Pete M.,0.0,5,"I did my research. I read the first two pages of reviews at Yelp. I felt I knew enough to at least act as if I knew what to do once I entered the haven of gustatory excellence. I prepped by not eating or drinking all day so as to have my innards as empty as possible by the time I arrived.I chose a day with gorgeous weather (good for standing outside if necessary) that was a weeknight, the better to possibly avoid the crowds.4:31 p.m.: The downtown Q train departs 57th Street.5:15 p.m.: The Q train pulls into the Avenue J station, and I get off.I descend to the street. Shockingly, there is no one anywhere near the pizzeria.I walk up and can see people inside, behind the locked front door, the woman who is presumably Dom DeMarco's daughter sweeping the floor. I am first in line! I have a novel with me and the Daily News, and I am already reading the News, so I lean up against the doorway, content to watch the parade of locals stream by in the sunshine, a breeze rippling up and down the street. But aside from a couple and two young guys who show up about 15 minutes before 6, the huge crowd I have been anticipating never materializes. While waiting, I eye the menu board and decide what I want. I also scope out the refrigerator and the table selection, spying the small circular table I want and fully ready to pounce on it if necessary once the doors open.6 p.m. comes and goes, and there is no sign of any effort being made to unlock the doors. The couple behind me is a little antsy, she noting aloud that it is 6 p.m. and craning her neck to see inside. I know, from reading the reviews at Yelp, that the doors open whenever the family feels like opening them. I have nowhere to be. I am content.At 6:10, Dom DeMarco's daughter comes to the doors and unlocks them and spreads them open. She then walks behind the counter and stands poised with a pen over a looseleaf tablet, ready to take my order. I order a regular pie with green olives and artichokes. Dom is there, of course, and he sets about the process of making the dough, grating the cheese, spreading the sauce, and distributing the olives and artichokes on the pizza. Meanwhile, I put my bag on the chair that was at the small circular table.I am pleased to see there are more than just the three tables that previous Yelpers had reported seeing. Not that the seating capacity is much greater than I had thought; there is probably seating for 10 to 15 people, probably closer to 15. I grab a couple of 8-ounce Diet Cokes and a 12-ounce can of seltzer from the fridge, and Dom's daughter tells me I will pay for the drinks when I get the pizza. I go back and get a Diet Pepsi for good measure. (Tab: $38.)I look for a bottle opener for the Diet Cokes, thinking it might be hanging off the side of the cooler. Then I spot a bottle opener sitting atop the napkin dispenser on the main counter. I take the bottles over and relieve them of their caps. Ten minutes later, Dom's daughter says loudly, ""OK, Peter?"" It is 6:20. She had put an empty tray on the counter, and, like clockwork, Dom had brought the pie out of the oven and set it, still bubbling, atop the tray. The master looks at me, smiles in a kindly grandfatherly way, and asks, ""Is this your pie?"" I say yes, and he nods and pours some more olive oil atop it, sprinkles some more grated cheese around the pie, and snip-snip-snips some basil all around the pie. Basil flies everywhere. Then he cuts the pie into triangles; I think there were eight altogether. I sprinkle crushed red peppers over the pie and add liberal doses of oregano. And now the moment of truth has arrived.I bring the pie over to the table, which is just large enough to accommodate the tray with a few inches to spare, most of that taken up by the array of drinks I had waiting. I put the newspaper basically under the tray so I could read it. The slices are better suited for eating with a knife and fork. In fact, I wish I had one of each and think about asking Dom's daughter, but I don't want to appear a rube, so I pick up the wayward huge green olive-as big as a Yankee's World Series ring--or artichoke and place it atop a slice of gooey goodness. Then, I spy a fellow diner using plastic utensils and ask him if they were out somewhere or if I have to ask at the counter. He says, ""They're up there, to the left."" Sure enough, in trays I had not seen at the far left of the counter are little labeled drawers containing plastic forks and knives. The pizza is, as some Yelpers have noted, unevenly burnt, but I don't care. Each piece is a delightful fiesta of flavor to be savored in the mouth, each crust a wonder of puffy, chewy excellence.I blitz through five slices, two thirds of the pie. Three slices remain. Alas, I have eaten and drunk as much as I can. I return the tray with the uneaten slices to Dom's daughter and thank her, and I leave. It is 7:30.I walk away, sated.

Sadly, it was not.  It's certainly a good slice of pizza with fresh basil and perfectly cooked crust (if you like the ny style crust), but it was also very oily, dripping off the slice, and the taste of the cheese was slightly overpowering.  If I had to wait an hour for it, I don't think it would be worth it.",2/25/2012,27,87,17,YTdE26NYZdIABe5ykRwJjA
2397,Ann L.,0.0,4,"Early on in the school year, my roommate and I decided to make the epic journey from Manhattan to Brooklyn, in search of the Holy Grail of Pizza, aka Di Fara's. It was a long, exhausting journey filled with lots of reading and crowding on the train, and by the time we actually got to Brooklyn, there was a small, hand-scrawled sign on the door: ""no more dough, will open again at 7:30pm"". We had arrived at 6:30pm. Any shopping malls or book stores to lounge around in and wait? Nope. After walking around aimlessly for an hour, we returned only to discover a large and rapidly growing line in front of the small door. Waited about another hour to get our pizza. It was 8:30 by the time we retrieved our beloved prize, and by that time my stomach was already eating itself.Therefore, I'm not really sure if the great flavor of the pizza was due to the fact that I was severely hungry or from the pizza itself, but the buffalo mozzarella and the fresh basil were awesome. The pizza was a little on the greasy side, but nothing a little napkin dabbing can't fix. Holy Grail? Maybe. Worth $5 a slice? Questionable, at best.

We truly ordered the gamut from arugula, red onions and goat cheese (I think?!)  to pesto shrimp to your standard margarita and every slice was better than the last.

2399,Tyler C.,0.0,3,"I'd give the pizza four or five stars, but there were a number of negative aspects to our visit that detracted from the overall experience.I'll start with the good: It was fun to watch Dom carefully (and slowly) make each pizza, and finish off each one with a handful of cheese, cut up basil leaves, and some olive oil.  The location is right next to the subway, so you don't have to trek around Brooklyn on foot to get there.  And of course, the pizza itself was good.And the bad: There were only two people working (Dom and another guy), and when we got there it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the counter to take our order.  When we were done eating, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came to the counter and allowed me to pay.  The place is small but it wasn't too hard to get a table, but having a table didn't matter because there weren't enough chairs.  The soda from the cooler was warm.  And even though the pizza was pretty good, the crust was burned on half of it, and even the unburned crust was too crunchy and not very appetizing.We went on a Saturday at 12:15pm (they opened at noon) and it wasn't too crowded, but even without the crowd we waited probably 35 minutes for the pizza.  It looked like the wait got much longer shortly after we ordered.  I'd say it's worth a trip to Brooklyn to try Di Fara's pizza once, but I would definitely try to pick a time (like we did) that avoids the crowds and long waits.",8/24/2008,11,22,4,YCO8mfUEf26Lko4jWXcM1Q

But this place is waaaay over-hyped.In fact, I would venture that if a Di Fara pie were subjected to a blind taste test of pizza-loving NYers, along with pies from other highly-rated pizzerias, the Di Fara would maybe, just maybe be judged average (or slightly above average).I think a fair number of the ecstatic reviews and superlatives that are heaped on Di Fara's pizza are the result of a combination of suggestion (the godawful lines, the interminable wait, and the excitement of seeing the grand master at work, pouring the olive oil and clipping generous mounds of fresh basil onto the pies) with the lemming effect (EVERYbody else and his mother says it's ""the BEST pizza,"" so it's gotta be the best, right?).It's kind of like the assumption that expensive wines taste better than cheap wines -- a proposition that has been shown in multiple studies, that is, blind taste tests, to not be the case, at least for the average taster -- see for instance,freakonomics.blogs.nytim…pnas.org/content/105/3/1…wine-economics.org/worki…What's wrong with Di Fara pizza, you ask? The tomato sauce, which is more a dried tomato juice than a proper sauce, is too bland; it should be sweeter and needs more spices. The cheese tends to form an oily mess that is much too salty and lacks the sweet creaminess of the fresh cheeses used in the best pizzerias. The edges of the crust are more often than not burnt to the point of being inedible. The meat toppings (eg pepperoni) are second- or third-rate. And he uses too much oil; this is a pizza, not a salad gdammit!Now, add to all of that the sickly off-yellow lighting and the squalor and grime of the place, both in the seating area (with its rickety chairs and tables that are seemingly never wiped off) and -- worse -- behind the counter where the pizzas are being made, and its a wonder anyone has an appetite left when the pizza is finally done.I do marvel at the dedication of the proprietor, who is a veritable Cal Ripken Jr of pizza-making, steadfastly turning them out one after another, day in and day out, year after year, each one getting the master's touch.

2423,JP B.,0.0,4,"Dom is getting heavy-handed with the olive oil of late.  It doesn't undermine the pizza, but it does make it heavy.  Regardless of which side you take your slice from (the burnt one or the other) the weight will be felt, and two slices will be all you can eat, even for those who can easily put down four from other pizza joints.Let's get the Di Fara's experience into some perspective: you order, you wait, you watch a master at work for what seems like an eternity, then you get your pizza.  The pizza is unique.  It's the opposite of what usually passes for high end pizza in this town.  Most high end pizza is brick oven style falling short of sublime because a corner or two were cut on the ingredients.  Here the ingredients are top notch, but the pizza is made in a gas oven, meaning it's closer to the ultimate refinement of a slice joint pie.  It still falls short of sublime, but it's very good.There's so much going for Di Fara's: good story, it's hard to get to and the wait is absurd, so it's a challenge for most New Yorkers.  Anything we'll willingly let test our fortitude HAS to be great, practically by definition.  But in the end it's great pizza.  Great by NYC standards still makes Di Fara's among the best in the world, I'd wager.   I'll admit it: I've had better pizza in this town.  That doesn't in any way eclipse the worthiness of this neighborhood genius and his work.  The experience is worth the trip.  The man is a treasure.",5/2/2009,81,429,0,GqoQO_FXPp-gTuxRx3_AoQ

I have to say, the first time I went I think I was a little underwhelmed, after all, it is just pizza right? Some dough, sauce, cheese, olive oil & basil, but the experience wound up changing the way I experienced pizza. Every NY slice after Di Fara's seemed more pedestrian than ever, so I went back and ""oh yeah, this is what f-ing good pizza tastes like!"" Do not buy this pizza by the slice, do not try to get fancy, the more simple the better (plain cheese or pepperoni, round or square).  As my friend said after taking her first couple of bites ""OK, Mr. Di Fara, YOU WIN"". This to me is ultimate nyc pizza & I think the secret doesn't just lie in one element, it is not just the quality ingredients, the homemade slow simmering sauce on the stove in the back, the cheese he freshly grates over each pie, the extra cheese he grates on top when the pie comes out of the oven with the fresh cut basil, etc, it is his whole technique, the care he puts into each pie and especially the olive oil that goes down on the pan and dough, even if your pizza gets a burn spots it tastes delicious because the olive oil has glazed the dough.

It is the pinnacle of pizza, and ridiculously delicious. Everyone's said everything I could--but go. GO.Sal & Carmine's has always been my favorite NY pizza (well, actually I really love Chicago-style the most, but I digress)--Grimaldi's, John's and Lombardi are also good, but not (to me) of the same caliber. This is FAR, FAR beyond even my two beloved Neopolitans on the upper west side :)Dom's also such a character. You gotta love the guy! He's so old-school and sweet, which is so refreshing in this day and age. We went on a Wednesday night at 8:45 (they close at 10) and had our pizza by 9:20--not bad at all. FWIW, people kept coming in long after 10, and getting pizzas without any wait since there was no line at that time of night.Wonderful food. And it reheats surprisingly well--almost as well as Sal & Carmine's. In a 350 degree oven for ten minutes, it tastes better the second time around than most pizza ever can.Just had a second taste of Di Fara's -- this time the square pie. Much thicker, juicier, and with a little more crusty ""harshness"" -- while it's also phenomenal, and more filling since I can eat just one slice and be very very happy, I think I prefer the round pies. They melt in your mouth-- literally! (And, again on a Wednesday night, there was almost no one there and I got my pizza in under 30 minutes!)It is VERY true that each night is different. The pizza is always phenomenal, but certain aspects stand out differently with every pie.

First thing I noticed was there was no pizza. Nothing on display, actually there was no display.No pizza stands,no food, nobody placing orders, taking orders, or talking.All I could see was the slightly hunched over old gentleman with a white apron on with his back facing to me seemingly busy. Second thing I noticed, it smelled amazing, like freshly baked dough and herbs. Not sure if they had run out of pizza or if this place was even for real, until finally with bare hands a beautiful literally steaming hot pie was pulled out of the oven and sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan and freshly picked basil leaves from the window sill. Before I could open my mouth, i was approached and asked ""what would you like?"" Finally getting my slice, I sat down at at a table that still had napkins and crumbs on it and took the first bite out of the most flavorful, crunchy, cheesy, saucy, goose bump inducing slice of pizza I've ever had.There was oozing, bubbling chunks of thick buffalo mozzarella, interrupted but not complicated by tastes of tomato, bites of basil, hints of olive oil, on top of crust good enough to be eaten on its own, and smothered with still melting grated parmesan.Do I think it's good? Yes. Do I think its worth it? Yes.Do I think its' the best ? Among them. Do I think its obscene to have go through this type of hassle, waiting, and ridiculousness for pizza?

Dom is all about the making each pizza to order, grating the cheese for each pie fresh. He's the sweetest guy who really loves making great pizza. As a visitor, things you need to know:- When his daughter is not there, there is no order or line. Just order while he's making the pizza and stay there while he makes it. Otherwise some local may claim it.- You may wait awhile for a pizza.- Square = sicilian thick crust, their specialty. - Regular = NY style thin crust.- It's hot, small, and can get cramped..no a/c.- Grab some dried thyme/oregano that you see in a basket and crush some on your pizza.- They close for an hour or two from 2-4 PM to replenish the oven.- It will be the BEST pizza you've had in your life.

The owner Domenico DiMarco is a joy to watch, oblivious to the world, skillfully crafting a pie behind the counter. He is like an artist with his sauces and cheeses. The place, despite being notoriously dingy, has an undeniable charm. But here's the thing: a slice costs $4 now, and frankly is just not worth the price.It is light, almost fluffy, warms up very fast if it is not hot already, and is no doubt a good slice of pizza. At most times Mr. DiMarco can not come close to making the pies fast enough to satisfy the lines that wrap around his building. I have found that the best time to come is at the end of the afternoon, just before they close up for break at 4.30pm. As I order my slice and sit down to enjoy, the door is locked at 4.22.There is joy here, the sharper than normal cheese bites you back. The fresh basil is always good. The crust is perfect. But the slice is small, and is nothing near a meal. The place crawls with tourists. On my last visit a Japanese couple with gigantic SLR cameras draped around their neck were waiting for a pie and a large group from Brazil had just arrived to take it all in. Watching the process is pleasant at first, but painstaking if you are waiting for a slice, as the pies slowly come in and out of the shrine-like oven.Every once in a while I will walk in and lay down my $4 to be a part of this New York story, but I'm not in the club that will stand outside here for two hours and claim their life was changed afterwards.",2/26/2009,181,339,735,Ygr8IFuKLQU27Te5_Kl_4A

I live in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and Difara is a short train ride from me. In fact, I went to High School not too far from the place. Too bad I only began to appreciate it after the fact. For the best Difara experience, you have to avoid the busy hours, mainly any time after 5 o'clock. If you show up at the right time , you can be sitting down and enjoying your pizza surprisingly fast. Also, don't come on Mondays! Dom now takes a day off during the week. Good for him. But it would be rather disappointingly to make the trek from Manhattan only to find the place closed. Absolutely nothing else to do around there, trust me.  If you do make it all the way to Difara, make sure to try both the regular and the square slice. Any toppings you make ask for will take longer.

2448,George L.,0.0,5,"I have been blessed with having grown up in Midwood, just a few blocks down Avenue J from DiFara and the transformation that place has gone through over the years has been a fairy tale in its own right.When I was 14 and a freshman at Midwood HS (I'm class of 95, so you figure it out) I remember going to DiFara to get a regular slice for $1.25 and thinking it was kinda pricey. There was another ""Italian"" pizza joint just a block away, on J and E. 14th at the time. Di Fara wasn't much of anything back then. No amazing ingredients, no amazing people, just a regular corner pizzeria with good pizza. The major change happened about 10 years ago when Dom decided to try to add more homemade food onto the menu and decided to add a few touches like fresh Parmigiana Reggiano and baby artichokes. Along with that came the fresh Buffalo Mozzarella and baby mushrooms (whole at the time). Then he decided to roast fresh peppers before serving and then he went all out. Well... the people came from all over and the wait became 45-1 hour... for anything. But you know what? I don't care. Dom is still like a grandpa to me and I love him and I love his food (all of it, not just the pizza) and you know what? He loves his customers and that's what makes his food special. Update: No more calling in for your pizza. They don't pick up the phone (self-admittedly.)  It now takes about 2 hours to get a pie. The staff (family) now has overgrown egos and refuses to change the way they manage their business to fit their growing demand. It still makes the best pizza, but it simply isn't good enough to go to it anymore. I mean they don't even tell you what their hours will be. They now open when they want to, close when they want to and take hours long breaks in the middle of the day. All without notifying the customers.  It isn't a good place for kids because of the crowds and wait times. It isn't a good place for a romantic anything. It's only good for a tourist who wants to say, ""yeah, I ate there"" and the prices reflect that.If you've never had it and the trip isn't too far, go. It's a bucket list thing.

I met someone recently who said she hated DiFara's pizza and that L&B Spumoni Gardens was much better.  I instantly knew her judgment was bad and that we wouldn't be friends.  ;-)",1/24/2013,19,70,2,ymF9gwWoxpDQEVmLo4vFBw

I feel that every single person has a different perception of the perfect slice, so there can be no one champion in a city of thousands of pizzerias. That said, I did love Di Fara. The crust was just the right height but didn't offer much support for the slice. The slice itself tasted phenomenal. The quality of the ingredients was surely some of the best. A tad greasy but I'm ok with that, you will never see me patting down a slice of pizza with my napkin. The cheese was pretty much perfect and the fresh basil cut onto the slice was an excellent touch. The last bit of the crust was a little too thin and burnt and wasn't the most fun to eat after the rest of the slice. The slices are also rather small for $5 and $2 for a glass bottle coke is a bit over the top (i also never drink soda so for all i know thats what soda costs these days?). Luckily we didn't have a very long wait as D Fara is known for (hint, go on cold rainy/snowy days). Was is absolutely delicious? You're damn right it was. Was it the greatest pizza in the world/NYC?

Let Dom hit it with his Coup de grace; a generous sprinkle of imported Parmigiano Reggiano, roughly cut aromatic basil imported from Israel and a luscious drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.The final step is your first bite.

Stepping boldly to the counter, my movements and breathing sounds suddenly seemed brash and inappropriate. Glancing at the rings of black soot that have gripped the upper walls and ceiling for years, I gently leaned against the refrigerator, holding my breath.A reverential silence hovered in the shop, as awestruck patrons stood at the counter watching Dominic DeMarco methodically shred hunks of buffalo mozzarella and spread it lovingly to the edges of a tender crust. A mound of freshly sliced mushrooms was dispersed with the same care, and then Dominic turned away from the crowd, his seasoned hands slowly lifting this glorious pie to the oven racks. He subsequently transferred a bubbling cheese pizza to a large delivery box, haphazardly clipping a bunch of fresh basil over its steaming slices. Then, a handful of romano cheese was sprinkled without flourish, its flecks evaporating in the tomato sauce. As the crowd quietly climaxed, two patrons placed their money on the counter and obsequiously carried their pizza outside. Three NYU students then arrived, and the spell was broken.For the next 45 minutes, we collectively listened to the tapping rain, contemplated the true meaning of tweeting, and watched Dominic and his son navigate the cramped kitchen with experienced postures. Theirs is a choreography of unspoken understanding, an orbiting series of movements so efficient that they become graceful. Only years of working together could render such a streamlined machine. Given my trouble walking in a straight line when sober, and my tendency to flail my arms when I am speaking, I was envious. Soon, our order was ready. Our pizza was gorgeous, fragrant with freshly snipped basil, olive oil, thick pepperoni slices, sliced garlic, buffalo mozzarella, and romano cheese. Unfortunately, Dominic's hand heavily oiled our pizza before and after it was placed in the oven, and our slices were drenched, to the point that only the chewy, salty, slightly charred edges resembled a crust. I was unable to fold my slices without dropping hunks of meat, garlic, and tomato on my plate, and resorted to picking bits of toppings up with each bite. Despite these trials, Di Fara's tasted unlike any pizza I have ever enjoyed (smoky, earthy, bright, and a touch bitter), and the experience of watching its preparation was incomparable.

2474,Maxine Y.,0.0,5,"A tale about this place:My bud Dan, who lives in Park Slope, insisted we go here for what was ""honestly, the best pizza in New York."" Dan told me he had a depressed friend who'd gone through a rough patch in life, and he would ride the subways around aimlessly. Whenever someone asked him for directions that involved going anywhere near Avenue J, he would tell them, ""You're going to Avenue J? Go to Di Fara's, it's the best pizza in the world. It's the only thing I'm sure of in this sorry life."" Anyway, we got there right as it opened, and I had two slices fresh out of the oven. The first two slices were the best pizza I'd ever had in my entire life, and the third--it was even better.",8/5/2007,3,50,1,aYDKuxI66I_eUB3-mWrjnw
2475,Kate L.,0.0,5,"I'm not sure what's better: the tiny hole in the wall feel, the old owner behind the counter who makes every pizza, or the pizza itself.   This place is old school, smoky pizza with no exhaust fan in sight.  It's all a part of the experience of DiFara's.  I was thankful to get a tip from a friend to get there when it opens.  Since we chose Sunday (Valentine's Day!) I think the place was less crowded than usual.  We stepped through the door moments after 12noon and there was only 10-12 people there.  As we waited for our pie to be ready, a steady stream of clientele piled in.My favorite part of the DiFara's experience was having my name called that the pie was ready.  I stepped up to the counter as it was placed in front of me.  ""To-go please"" and it was smoothly slid into the pizza box.  The owner took a bunch of basil and chopped it with scizzors all across the pizza, his son cut the pie as the owner went behind him for a large handful of grated parmigian.  He tossed it onto the sizzling hot pie and it began to melt as soon as it hit.  I thought that was it as his son began to fold the sides of the box, but no! The owner came back with what looked like a tea-kettle and drizzled delicious olive oil all over the pizza.  We placed the pizza on a small nearby table and dug in.  Pizza Heaven.",2/14/2010,47,214,0,Mw2tZBze6IMMt5SpDgguPw

Yes, it is oily (they, and by they I mean the old fellow who runs the place, put extra olive oil on before tossing it in the oven) But each pie has about a pound of fresh grated mozzarella on it, a very nice sauce and when it comes out it gets some fresh grated parmesean and fresh basil. Looks like most of it is all imported from Italy. The crust was nice and crisp. The place does get packed but if you have the time its worth the wait. Its not cheap ($20 for a plain pie) and cash only. But, I still think its worth it.So much better than Grimaldi's has been recently.",8/3/2008,25,153,3,5ntIF7j0pVehGjYuDlFVFg

It no longer mattered that we had spent half the afternoon tucked away in a dingy, greasy little restaurant in Midwood, Brooklyn.Skeptical as every good native New Yorker (and pizza aficionado) should be, I bit into that first slice ready to find fault after waiting TWO-AND-A-HALF HOURS.But there was none.

2525,Rachel L.,0.0,5,"After my skillfully conducted research into the tradition of New York Style pizza [aka putting my tastebuds to work], I dub Di Fara's the best pizza in the area.  Yes, there are many mighty competitors, but they can not hold up to the basil-scented, olive oil-infused cheesy top or the perfectly baked crust.  The truth is this:  It may not be the best pizza in New York [who knows what dark alleys hide], but watching Domenico make the pizza takes the... dough [or proverbial cake, if you prefer]!  This is a man who LOVES pizza, and has dedicated his life to perfecting it.  Watching him work with the dough is an anachronistic experience to the max, and alongside his work, your soul will be teleported to a time where making pizza - something most Americans consider fast food - was an art form.  You too will take pride in his work right before it is torn apart by your incisors.But, yes, it is a trek [especially if you dwell in Harlem like me].  And, yes, the wait is generally longer than the subway ride.  But, do it.  It'll change your life.  Also, if you live in Manhattan, I dare you to try to make it back to your house without devouring the entire thing.  If you take my challenge, bring lots of napkins.  The delicate crust will hold up [no cheese on the clothes], but the olive oil covers your hands in a lingering layer of deliciousness.  Translation:  You might make a mess.",2/3/2009,237,184,0,YtiGF_UCUf91B2z3bed4lg

Consider it not being influenced, or just plain stubborn. Here's my two cents. =)After a day of helping some friends move into a new apartment we were all STARVING! Not just STARVING, but ""stomaches gnawing on backbones"" hungry! Where to go???

Sorry guys... this place looks run down. Want to go somewhere else?""Them: ""No, we're really hungry.""We walked in and just stood there a minute. An old man was burning pies and smoke had filled the place. It was stinging my eyes and we shared a look. After looking over the menu posted on the wall we decided on 2 square pies. Our order was taken down on a note pad in scribble and we sat down. As we waited we noticed all the articles on the wall about how old the place was. The old man cooking had been cooking there since the place opened! The pizza... well I must say it was the best I've ever had! It was thick and crispy and not burned at all. Yes, the black corners look scary, but they're so very delicious! This is my new addiction. It isn't fast, and you're so eager to eat it you'll probably scorch the roof of your mouth, but it's all worth it!

Dom was already working his magic and had several pies lined up on the counter that he was preparing.  His daughter immediately greeted me and asked what I would like to order.  I didn't travel on the friggin subway just to get a single slice.  I went for the whole pie. She also took my name and wrote down my order.  At exactly 12 Noon, a well dressed silver haired gentlemen walked into the establishment and proceeded to the front of the counter.  Dom's daughter immediately placed a freshly baked pizza into a box and said ""  *******, your order is ready"".  The gentlemen took his pizza and left the premises as quickly as he entered.  Dom then took out another pizza from the oven and drizzled some olive oil on the pizza before clipping some fresh basil on top.  His daughter called my name and I was happily on my way.  The cheese on the pizza was still bubbling. She proceeded to take care of the 7 persons in front of me who just wanted slices immediately after.  No one complained.  Everyone was cordial and happy as they were all about to get their slices.I decided to have a few slices there since the pizza was fresh out of the oven.WARNING: No matter how good the pizza smells, DO NOT eat it right away.  Let it cool down.  I nearly burnt the top of my mouth.   Wash it down with a Pellegrino Aranciata and you feel like you're back in the old country again.  You can immediately taste the freshnest and high quality ingredients all blending together.  DiFara is at a whole different level than your average NY pizzeria. I took the remaining slices home.  The pizza isn't going to taste the same when you reheat them at home in the oven but it's still pretty good.  Now since I only waited a total of 10 minutes for the best tasting pizza in NY, how can I not give it the full 5 stars?At $4 per slice or $20 per pie, (traditional round pizza),  why aren't you getting up off your ass and heading over there right now?  The fresh baked pie is the best pizza you can get and it's a bargain.  So stop whining about the price already.  Or better yet, don't go.  At least not until I've had a chance to go back and try the Sicilian, (square slices), which are prepared a little differently.Cheers!N",5/3/2008,13,138,6,9Tsvhx8dvOyHPNvpJqthvw
2549,Kiesha R.,0.0,5,"I'm not a huge pizza eater. I think pizza is fine, but given the choice almost any day of the week, I'll opt for something else. That said, after a trip to New York about a year ago, my husband came back raving about this place in Brooklyn where an old man makes pizza. Perhaps because I don't love pizza...perhaps because I'm from California...I just couldn't understand what could be so great about this place. But I certainly trust his taste, and he knows me well enough by now to be familiar with what I'd like - so on our next trip to NY together this past June, we went (back).I don't know how to describe the experience I had. 4 of us went and ate 2 regular pies. I didn't even understand the concept of a ""regular"" pie at the time, but after that, I sought it out everywhere we went. Nothing came close - obviously nothing in California, and nothing here in New York, either. Lombardi's? Please. PLEASE. It's like cardboard next to Di Fara's, who gets the crust amazingly brick oven thin, yet flavorful and just slightly doughy.Tonight, we went again - this time, 3 of us. Thankfully, one person got a slice (square - he said very good, but not as satisfying as original) before eating our pie - because we only ordered one. Note to selves: only go here in even numbers, else someone is going to be s-o-l on their share!And now, after the second experience here, I can do a proper review. The first time, I didn't understand what I was experiencing. This time, I did - I knew to expect greatness. I knew to savor the olive oil dripping off my pizza and down my chin. I knew to take in the aromatic basil.

This is one of those foods that kind of changes the way you think about food forever.We ordered both the plain round and a square special. We didn't like the square pizza as much, since the surface area of the pizza was smaller and therefore the crust was a little thicker, and I'm all about thin crusts.  Stick with the plain round. The three cheeses, the fresh basil he cuts over the top of the pizza, the sweet sauce, the great crunchy crust - it's perfection. Absolute perfection. The day we had di fara, it was storming, the subway broke down, and I was on my third day of having the flu. But, it was our last day in NY, and our last chance for Di Fara. So I endured a 1.5 hr subway ride + 30 min cab ride + side trip to Duane Reade for some DayQuil and a box of tissues + 30 min wait for the pizza (luckily it was a slow day because of the storm).

Oh yeah, always go for the pie. You pay $5 for one slice, so why not get the eight slices for $28? Also after your long wait you'll be glad you got more pizza. I have had both round and square, call me traditional but I'm more a fan of the round. I always get half peperoni, half plain. The peperoni is insanely delicious, but you also want to have the chance to sample the purity of the untouched cheesy, basil goodness of the original. All the haters who complain about the line are heartless Debbie Downers who can keep off the line. Go get your Famiglia around the corner and leave the good stuff for those of us who appreciate the art and craft that is a slice of Dom's pizza.

2578,Photo T.,0.0,2,"I uploaded my photo of the slice I had on 9/18/14. I did not do anything to the slice or the photo, it is original photo. Arrived after the lunch crowd expecting a spare slice to be leftover for a quick purchase. That did not happen, had to wait for that spare.slice to buy for 2 hours and 17 minutes. Placed my one cheese slice order and was told it would be at least an hour and a half before any single slices would be available. Spent that time by hopping on the Q train, went to Coney Island, had two Nathans hot dogs and returned to DiFara 1 hour and 25 minutes later. Was told that I had not missed my slice and it would be about another 45 minutes for my slice to be ready. So roamed around the neighborhood which is a Jewish neighborhood with a very low crime rate and went and had a pastry from the Jewish bakery across the street. When the slice arrived it was quite small without much sauce spread on it. There was a tomato clump near the end, cheese was heavy towards one side and slight on the other. Basil leaves were plentiful and evenly spread. Took several photos of top, sides and the bottom crust. The bottom crust was evenly cooked and crisp. When starting to eat this slice experienced a flavor rush similar to a macaron where you are overwhelmed by strong ingredients. Had to slow down to try to figure out what the flavor rush was caused by. After eating this slice spent about a half an hour outside the open window and studied what the pizzamaker was doing. Spoke to a few people waiting for their pies and read reviews and history of Difara. Here is my advice; retire the founder, originator and expert pizzamaker asap. It is not right to have anyone in this elderly state making every pie, maybe a few hours a week but every pie, every minute, every working hour? People need to stop being selfish and urge him to keep working. There is an entire family working there that can make equal pies and for  respect all customers can tell the family that the pies they are making are almost as good as the originals and that way everyone is content. For those of you reading my review wondering if it is worth the cost and the wait for single slices the answer is no. If you have several people and $30-$35 to split and blow on a pizza pie then do it. The flavor rush was due to the oil from the melted cheese and olive oil. If my slice was better I would give this review 3 stars, if I had split a pie with others I would have given the review 3 or 4 stars. Is this the best slice of pizza in all of NY or the USA or the world the answer is no. Is this one of the most flavorful pizzas the answer is yes. I recommend going to Pizza Suprema located just soutwest of penn station for quick service, lower cost and a sauce mixture that has its own unique flavor rush. For those on a budget recommend going to Patsy's in east harlem. The cheese only slices are only $1.75 when bought at their takeout area which is next to their restaurant. The slices are from a coal oven with a very tasty sauce and oily cheese. No flavor rush but three slices at $5.25 with at most a 15 minute wait compared to $5 with over a 2 hour wait ar DiFara is no comparison at all",3/26/2006,0,5,1,aWUuym218luWE2yJnFkqZw

I think I may have had better in Italy, but I might have been starving that day too. You have to be kind of aggressive after your order though. Stay at the counter. Once you leave to sit down or something, they'll forget about you and you're on the end of the virtual list again. If you're at the counter, definitely watch they guy (Dom). He literally sticks his finger in burning oil. That's what decades of making pizza does to a guy.

The pizza made by Domenic (the owner and as far as I know sole cook in the pizzeria) it some of the tastiest I've ever tried.  One slice is never enough, even two will leave you wanting more. Take the suggestion of other reviewers and order a pie by calling ahead. You will still have to wait a darn long time to get it, but when Domenic hands you an entire pie the jealous looks you will get from the rest of the people waiting at the counter will tell you that you've got something special. While waiting walk around the shop and read the numerous articles and awards that the place has gotten, pick out your drinks from the good selection that he has there, but most importantly watch the care with which Domenic makes the pies and the skill with which he handles the burning hot pies in the oven with his bare hands.

2590,Steph C.,0.0,5,"This pizza is the best pizza I have had, ever. I have only been here once, and once is enough to tell me that Di Fara's pizza blows all other places out of the water. Of course, to be honest, I haven't tried every single pizza place in new york, lol.In any case, I will tell you why I believe that Di Fara serves the best pizza. My answer is two-fold. First, it is obviously the taste of the pizza itself. It isn't like any other pizzeria. Need I tell you that the majority of the pizza I have eaten are like those that you would find in the cookie cutter pizzerias: melted cheese atop a moderately thick dough. It's like they follow this one recipe. Now, Di Fara's is a bit different. I don't know what he does to this pizza, but it is just amazing. It is the avant garde of pizzas. You just have to go to believe it. My second answer will seem a bit atypical because it isn't discussed much in the reviews, nor is it exactly a necessity for a pizza dining experience. After all, a food venue has to serve good food for it to be exceptional. Di Fara's not only gives an original pizza, but it gives an experience. The pizza owner, who I believe to be in his seventies (I am sorry if I'm wrong), personally makes his pizzas for each and every customer. I found this to be very poignant. This part makes Di Fara's a truly original experience. You know when your mother makes you a dish and it's the best not because she's a great cook, but because she makes it with love. This is comparable with Di Fara's, and it makes the pizza that much better. The people that wait on line for hours on end know this. It's a community in there and I don't know which other pizzeria can offer that sort of community. Food gathers people and really that maxim has never been so true until I came to Di Fara's.All right, I should get on with the cons of this place so that I don't seem like an employee or something. I alluded to it before, but the line is going to be long. My friend who is a regular at the place says so, and when I went, it was before it opened and a line was already there. Expect to wait an hour or two at the least. Secondly, the ordering process is a bit disorganized. I feel that someone can just cut and you can't do anything about it. I would be pretty pissed if I waited in line for a couple hours and some discourteous person cut the line, skipping the hour or two wait. Thirdly, the pizzas are expensive. I heard that it rose since the last time I had gone. And lastly, they don't deliver.There you have it! I hope it helps!",8/23/2009,0,3,0,NZvW0k_OnU0HNQS4R6FddQ

2598,Jonas M.,0.0,4,"Di Fara's pizza is really good. Not the best (although this is notoriously subjective), but without doubt, a superior slice. After waiting an hour and a half in line and another half hour after ordering, we finally got our square pizza. This pizza was clearly different from the others I've had in the past. There was the twice-baked crust that had the traditional crisp of a New York slice, but yielded a pillow-ly soft texture that sweated fragrant drops of extra virgin olive oil when biting into it. There were molten slicks of mozzarella cheese dolloped with oil that looked like hot springs amid the volcanic landscape of slightly charred crust. And the bouquet of pungent grated cheese and freshly snipped basil registered a small tremor in my olfactory senses.After I ate my pizza, I found myself crying. However, these weren't tears of joy: they were my tear ducts reacting to the acrid smoke coming the oven. It was readily apparent that the ventilation system at this pretty, little shithole on 15th and Avenue J hadn't been renovated since Nixon got impeached.Although tasting Di Fara's wasn't quite the religious experience that other's proclaim it to be, my pizza pilgrimage to Di Fara was was instructional in several respects:- The foodie-devoted will travel from the outer boroughs if you have the best of ""something."" - This was the first time since Disneyland I've waited more than 2 hours for anything.-  The more one waits, the more one will adjust the value they get from a particular experience to compensate for the time one invests [1].[1]: faculty.chicagobooth.edu…",10/11/2010,6,166,0,uMrMfnJbSWjHM4Qj2r5fIw

But I thought I'd weigh in and see if I might be able to add a hint of moderation to the chorus of orgasmic praise that has been lavished upon this pizzeria.After reading all these reviews, a few friends and I decided to check it out for ourselves. First tip: Arrive early. We got to the restaurant at exactly 6 (when it reopens) and there was a sign saying that they would actually open at 7 that night. Since there was nothing else to do in that neighborhood, we just stood in line and waited. And it was a good thing we did that; by 7pm, there was a line of probably 40-50 people waiting for the opening.When the doors opened, one person went the counter to order while the others commandeered a table (there are only 5 tables, two of which can seat 3-4 people, and three that can seat 2 people). It was a bit of a cold night, so most of the unseated patrons decided to move inside to wait. This meant that we had dozens of people standing over our table. A bit suffocating, but not the end of the world. After placing the order, our pizza took about 20 minutes to be ready.Now, to the main event: the pizza. I must say, this is not the best pizza I've ever had. It was, however, the greasiest. Personally, I love it that way. Not all of my friends agreed, and a couple of them were mopping up the pools of orange grease before eating their slices. The tomato sauce was excellent, with some chunks of tomato and plenty of oregano. The cheese was also very good, a mix of a couple varieties. The crust was definitely burnt, which was disappointing, but didn't keep me from enjoying it. I especially liked the heap of basil.Tips: Show up 20 minutes before opening and you'll enjoy your experience much more. Bring your own drinks (they don't care) and save some money. Come with friends and split a whole pie to cut down on costs.Conclusion: I honestly have no idea why some people nearly climax when describing this pizza. It is a good slice of pizza. That's all. And when you consider the price ($5/slice, $25/plain pie), the location, and the atmosphere, I'm not sure you're getting your money's worth. I might go back if I happen to walk by and notice that there is no line. However, I doubt this will every happen because there's absolutely no reason for me to be in this neighborhood in the first place, and I'm sure it's almost always packed.",10/31/2010,2,79,15,_0ZLfcWxTSeZUy3W5d-tbQ

2630,Hank K.,0.0,3,"I'm a big pizza guy and the rep this place has peaked my curiosity.   I was a bit disappointed to say the least.   Mr Di Fara is indeed a culinary genius.   Every one of his pizzas are painstakingly hand made by him.  there are four to five different cheeses and imported olive oil and home made mozzarella going into each pie.  When you bite into the pizza, the flavor explodes in your mouth.   Now my problem is not with the food but rather with the way the business is run.   The culinary prodigy is a 70 -ish old man who moves pain stakingly slow.   And the other counter person is either his son or his daughter who happen to lose at rock paper sissors that  day.  The wait is usually about forty minutes because he can only pump out one pie at a time and there are usually a line going out the door.  A feat that cannot be taken lightly since he is located in the middle of a hasidic neighborhood of coney Island and ave J. (And they don't eat non - kosher pizza!)                    The second and more important problem I have with this establishment is that the place has never been cleaned since it has been opened.   I mean are you serious?   A restaurant with that many accolades on the wall and there are two inches of dust on each award?   Everything from the tables to counters to the soda dispensers, it has never been cleaned.   with all this business the man is doing, would it hurt to hire a after school help to clean and wipe down the place once in a while?    I really hate to be harsh because the owner and the master chef is really a great person but you should really let someone manage the place for you so you can concentrate more on your dough.",12/3/2010,19,83,771,UQB-waTFKPajvLQFLgVCeA

My only complaint is that they go very, very heavy on the olive oil. I would have been happy with about half of what he put on.

2634,David S.,0.0,5,"The Famous DiFara always lives up to the hype! I've been eating this delicious pizza for about 10 years now and every time is literally an adventure. First off, you gotta pick your times- if you are going to go on a nice sunny day , midday, prepare to wait 2 hours, that's right 2 hours for a pie. If you order a slice , the people waiting to order will look at you like you're crazy... and you would be because there is no way in hell you are only going to want 1 slice. If you do not know about Domenico DeMarco, the artist who makes these pies then you've been out of the loop for some time... google him . If you are smart, you'll wait till the weather is bad and go later in the day, you'll get a pie quick (about 20 mins) and you'll cheer like my fiance and I did on the night of the first snowstorm in Brooklyn last December 2013. The pizza  is truly succulent. DiFara only uses San Marzano ingredients imprted from Italy. He seasons these pies himself, what a process.

Having a slice of this pizza is not just to feed your hunger or to satisfy your tastebuds, it is, most importantly, a beautiful and fulfiling experience for the soul. I understand a lot of people would think the wait is dreadful, but to us,  watching the master slowly rolling the dough, carefully cutting the meat, gently putting the pie in the oven are all part of the dining experience.  We have visited the place a couple of times, even on a very hot summer day, we would just stand in his non-airconditioned workshop quietly and watch him repeat the cycle. I admire how much love and passion he puts into his work, and the result is simply a masterpiece. We always order the pie half and half, half with pepperoni, half plain with basil.  The pie crust is not too thin, not too thick, with just right amout of chewyness. And the basil, the meat, the cheese, the oilve oil are perfectly blended together. Every bite is an experience. Enjoy.",9/18/2009,1,35,3,Y_CW45WfOUtqwzN6HtuXRA

2675,Ann L.,0.0,4,"This place has some good pizza.  We ordered a thin round (the classic), which has 8 slices.  It was thin enough that my husband was able to finish 6 slices without much trouble, and I had two.  He says that it was the best pizza that he has had that he can remember.  And he loves his pizza.  For myself, while the pizza was really good, I think I would have enjoyed it much more had I ordered a slice of the square pizza.  The square (as I saw from the others around me) was much thicker, like a deep dish, with lots of cheese on it.  Make sure to order the square if you generally enjoy Chicago style or deep dish pizzas.  For those that like the thin crust and minimal cheese and crust pizzas, go with classic.One other thing that made the pizza less than ideal for me was that it was absolutely oozing in oil.  The man who makes the pizza (Di Marco, I think was his name) is the only one who makes them and one of his signature touches to the pizzas is to add a rather large drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over the entire pizza after it comes out of the oven.  The pizza came out seriously GLEAMING from the layer of oil on top of it.  Yuck.  I know, I know - it's a personal preference.  Some people LOVE that; others are not such fans.  I fall in the latter category.  I had to dab a whole lot of it off, and even still, the pizza was just way too oily for me.   Just an FYI to others like me who might want to be warned!  Otherwise, disregard and enjoy! :) Last note, but be prepared for a LONG WAIT.  Others here have commented about this, but when we arrived, there was just one guy that was taking orders and payment, and not in a very systematic manner.  It took us 10 minutes to even grab his attention to order and what was supposed to take 30 minutes (perhaps less, he said) for the pizza to be ready, ended up being more like 50 minutes.  I think it's just the nature of the place and how it's run, but in such a cramped, crowded space, it wasn't much fun.  Bottom line - good classic pizza with a great looking square pizza, but be mindful of the wait and oily goodness.",7/11/2008,9,151,0,UpdJ1qEBNRAwkhxJT1Ykxg

2678,Mary R.,0.0,4,"I finally had the opportunity to taste the savory slice of Di Fara.  My bf and I decided to have pizza for lunch and since I've never tried Di Fara before he suggested we go there.  Just walking towards the corner where the pizzeria sits, you would never notice it was open for business.  It's really dark inside, so you can't see the crowd of people waiting until you walk right up to the doorway and say to yourself ""holy cow!""  We walked in confused.  We couldn't figure out where we should order, so we started to ask random people if they knew where the line was.  Funny as it may seem, but they didn't know either and yet they had ordered their pizza already.  We made our way to the counter and ordered 2 slices.  There was no way of knowing who came first, so you just need to stick by the counter and plant your feet there hoping the girl taking the orders remembers you walked in before the others.Di Fara really would not be so packed if it wasn't for a one man show.  It takes Dom literally 15mins to prepare a pie to be placed in the oven.  The poor man is so old now that he works like a turtle.  He does have a younger man in the back preparing the dough and that in itself takes  the same amount of time as preparing a pie.I can't say that it was totally worth the 45mins wait for a $5 slice, but I do give them the credit of using fresh ingredients and Dom making every single pie in this establishment all by himself.  If you're looking to enjoy a slice of pizza on the go... don't go!  If you're looking to try the infamous Di Fara's pizza, I suggest getting a pie - it's a lot cheaper (not including any toppings).",4/20/2009,11,32,19,83PhQJu8CKqBeiouYdlsrg

2683,Nick S.,0.0,5,"Nothing I could say here would contribute anything new. Essentially, I am here to fall heavily enough onto the review bell curve so as to eventually negate the reviews that have been less than 5 stars so Di Fara will hopefully read ""5 stars, 573 reviews"" instead of ""4.5 stars, 572 reviews.""I do not live in Brooklyn, I live five hours away in Brookline. But every time I step foot in Manhattan off the Bolt Bus, I save an afternoon and an evening for making this epic pilgrimage down to Q line onto Avenue J so I can get some of Domenico the Pizza Wizard's sorcery into my stomach.I can't resist making a completely unimaginative and disrespectful comparison like making the Hajj to Mecca. This is a journey you must plan for: it costs you a large chunk of time and a large chunk of money, and to have that stand as the basis for your review calling this place less than stellar is to functionally misunderstand the concept. It's written all over the walls in the write-ups from NYC magazines over the past several decades, the guys who work for Dom explain this to you, the horde of people suffocating the small size of this place indicate it to you... what more explanation do you want? You're going to pay a lot of money for a pizza and it's going to take a long, long time... but good lord is it worth it.I accept that it is a valid criticism too say that Domenico goes too heavy on the olive oil, underneath the pizza, throughout the pizza, and on top of the pizza. But it's part-and-parcel with the overall heavy pizza he constructs in general.The herbs he grows on the windowsill of the business that he then coarsely chops with scissors all over your pizza... oh man is that good, and essential to the flavor of each pizza.The fact that the ingredients are sort of scattered variously around the surface area of your pie leads to an interesting variation of the flavor from slice to slice... this piece has more pepperoni, this piece is all pizza and no toppings, this piece is herb city. Honestly, I don't think that's naive; it's exciting. This is what it is to have something prepared gourmet by an artisan. This what what that means, in the dictionary and stuff. This is one product, mass produced by one guy, who needs to take a break in the middle of the day, and has the right to do it whenever he wants for as long as he wants. His pizzas speak for themselves, and the demand will never decrease because he doesn't function on the same clock a business of more than one would.",10/8/2010,31,47,4,5TlNLvyH_h9QICLL1N3pDA

We were clueless about how to order until someone in the know told us to muscle our way up to the counter.During the half-hour wait (which I'm seeing is really not that bad) I was all stressed out and nervous. Was I doing this right? Would we ever get a slice? Was it gonna be worth it? It looked like Dominic was using regular (i.e. not fresh) mozzarella -- I came to Midwood for THIS? At $4 a slice, it seemed like a ripoff.Finally, we got our slices. The place was so crowded and frankly unappealing that we opted to eat on the street.The first bite? Meh. It didn't live up to the hype.  Then something magical occurred. The sheer transcendence hit me on the second bite, and each bite after that was heaven. We kicked ourselves for not ordering a whole pie and taking the leftovers home. Don't let this happen to you.

The Staff- it's a family owned business, two cutest ( from what I understood daughters) that help out their father, the man himself who stands there SOLO putting love into every single pie ( true story) The Experience- it's well worth watching the pizza being made, watch out for the last minute fresh basil addition. I stood there for an hour or so waiting for two slices and was fascinated. Di Fara has it's own lingo/culture and at first you don't get it, there is absolutely no structure ( although the daughters attempt at writing orders in an ""orderly"" matter. it's lovely and the experience makes the pizza so much more delicious.The Pizza- my first encounter with Di Fara was a cold pizza slice from a pie my friend has purchased 2 hours before I got to it. It was late, we drank wine and were hungry. I was in heaven, it was the best tasting cold slice of pizza I have ever consumed. AhhhIt took me about 2 months to get to Di Faras myself ( due to their weird hours of operation ) never seemed to work out with my schedule. The 2nd time I ate Pizza from Di Faras I received the whole experience, the pizza was warm this time and fresh from the oven, I got a plain slice and it was good but not as good as I expected.

2689,Sid D.,0.0,2,"I have no problems accepting that their pizza is very good (which is what saved this from the lowest rank), though I didn't get to have any of it. However, I have a big problem with the guy who took my order. He mis-represented big time. As I stood by the counter to place my order, I asked whether a pie would be quicker, or a few slices. He said that, if I wanted more than a couple of slices, the pie would be quicker. I asked him how long, and he said, "" about 40 min"". I was ok with that wait, on a Saturday afternoon at 2:25, and placed the order and paid in advance.Long story short, we waited for an hour and ten minutes, the line for slices moved much faster, and we had still not received our order. In fact, by now we had figured out his process of tracking / placing orders, and there was no way we were going to get this in the next hour. I asked him again how long, and he again said ""40 min or so"", when we had already been waiting for 70 min! Why not announce this 2 hour wait the first time around? Now, I don't have a problem with a $40 pizza, because it is listed on the menu. I do have a problem with someone who says the wait is 40 min, when he definitely knew that my wait was likely to be two hours or longer. I had paid in advance, so I asked for my money back, which he reluctantly gave me. It was a waste of a precious Saturday afternoon, since I made the trek from midtown. But, I am glad I saved that extra hour. I may have missed a few slices of good pizza, but after how this guy lied to me, I would not have enjoyed it.

It was a straight shot on the Q from our hotel in Tribeca, and we were there in 30 minutes. We meant to line up before 12, when we thought they opened, but didn't make it there until around 12:50. Turned out they open at 1 on Sundays, and there was a modest line waiting for Di Fara to roll up the grate. The first few pies went to the groups ahead of us, and in no time we were at the front of the line, being offered slices from a steaming cheese pie. We had intended to order an entire pie ($28) but happily forked over $15 for three slices and ate them standing outside as a long line quickly formed. The sauce, blend of cheeses, drizzle of oil and scattering of basil atop a thin, chewy crust were just perfect. The crust's blackened bottom was imparted a beautiful charred flavor.

2699,Marilyn C.,0.0,2,"Had a horrible experience with this restaurant.  We went on a weekend and it was very busy and took 2 to 3 hours to get our pizza, which was horribly burnt and had to be re-done, which took ANOTHER hour and the pizza was still considerably burned but they served it to us anyways and after spending 4 hours trying to get pizza we were starving and desperate so we accepted and ate it even though it was pretty much ruined.   The old man who owns and runs the place takes so much care and pride in making the pizza by hand himself.  Its very cute to watch at first as he snips the basil by hand and drizzles each pie with Olive Oil, but it soon looses its appeal as you realize you may not get your pie before the next millennium.   The poor old man seemed overwhelmed by the constant stream of people coming in and barking orders and asking ""how long until my pie is ready"". I could tell that he burned our pizza on two occasions because he forgot it and left it in for too long while he was trying to (unsuccessfully) multitask.  I really felt sorry for him though.  It was like watching a perfectionist/control freak being pushed to produce at a faster pace than he was was comfortable with.  You could see that he was just as mad at himself for burning our Pizza as we were.  I don't think he realized that he burned OUR pizza twice in a row.  I would hope that maybe we'd get a free pie, or even a discount...but NOPE.The restaurant is more or less a stand up whole in the wall where you have to fight to get your pizza order in much like fighting to get a drink in a posh Manhattan bar.  There are 2 tiny plastic outdoor patio furniture type tables in the back of the restaurant to crowd around and eat.  No place to sit and wait for your pizza to be made.  The worst part is that locals come in all the time and get to put their order in ahead of everyone else or will call in their order and show up and skip the line.  The few bites of unburnt pizza we had were simply amazing though.  I really want to come back and try this place again on a slow day/time.  Definitley authentic New York Style thin crust pizza.  Fresh ingredients, many of which are shipped directly from Italy.  The owner is a first generation immigrant I am pretty sure.  The fresh olive oil drizzled on top and basil that he snips right off a live plant (both imports from Italy) send the flavor over the top.  This place is very well reviewed by all the papers and magazines.  I am pretty sure the pizza would be as good as everyone raves if it was not burnt.  BUT the rude service, slow speed, and lack of any seating are so bad it makes one question their sanity and pray that the pie is worth the hellacious experience.If i had to rate the bites of burnt pie alone, I'd give this place a 1.  If I had to rate the unburnt bites of pie alone, I'd give this place a 5.  If i had to rate the service, speed, price, or atmosphere alone, I'd give this place a 1.  Thus, I'll average that out to a 2 star experience.",7/4/2010,193,258,393,Nt_JIMr-KKsgKPK4LuNoZw

2703,Deanna W.,0.0,5,"Di Fara's: I love, I love, I love.It inspires me to new heights of craziness in my food eating adventures. I've been going on and off since 2003, my first time as a wide eyed, gawking tourist from Canada. I brought my boyfriend, he sat and waited at a table doing a slow burn while I held our place in line all the while soaking in the theatrics of a true pizzaiolo. Since that virgin visit, I've returned a couple of times each year, enough to have the Q train schedule burned into my memory. Enough to endure hour long subway rides back and forth. Enough to know that I should bring a Tolstoy tome to pass the time between commute and pizza making. A couple of years ago I ventured out and I made the sore mistake of not calling beforehand so I braved freezing temperatures and a windy snow storm only to arrive at a closed storefront. Arrgghh! So I was on a Di Fara's hiatus for the last two years. Enough with the erratic hours and the gong-show waits I thought, time to move on. Although I could never help but wonder when I would make my next return to my own personal pizza mecca. I went back this past week seizing the great snowstorm of February as a capital pizza eating opportunity. And yes I called beforehand. The place is as charmingly worn down as it was before with a fresh lick of green paint inside. And Dom, the septuagenarian pizza maestro is still sporting the same worn plaid shirt and cap, churning out pies effortlessly.  Maggie -his wry daughter mans the counter and tries to keep the crowds in check with her expediting. I had a 20 minute wait for a pie this visit but other visits I've waited upwards of an hour and half to two hours. So yeah, don't go on the weekends or prime dinnertime. It's a zoo and it requires all the patience and zen of a Jedi master to endure the madness. Like Luke you'll find yourself tempted by the dark side when others (most likely the uninitiated or uncouth) cut in front or steal a pizza out of turn only to have your eyes cut into their backs like daggers. But the pizza here is first rate in my books. Yes, it's not true authentic Neapolitan style neither pliable or fluffy soft in its dough. Tender, chewy crisp is more appropriate. The thin crust barely strong enough to support the dynamite melange of cheese on top. Added extra virgin olive oil almost gilds the lily, a dangerous pool of cheese and oil. If Dom is extra generous with the oil, the dough groans to support the embarrassment of riches, like strippers at a frat boy party. Oil, cheese and more oil: sometimes you'll get a pie with a sheen not unlike a pimply teenager from Fat city. It's a flavorful greasy mess though not for everyone. The tomato sauce is suitably herbaceous and sweet and the dusting of grana padano on top lends a sweet nuttiness to the mozz below.  Finally, a sprinkle of the specially imported basil gives a nice verdant freshness to each pie, I couldn't imagine having a slice without some of that good stuff.

2706,Mehreen W.,0.0,5,"So I finally made it to this neck of the woods , aka Midwood. I came here a little after they had opened on a Thursday. The wait was about an 1 hour, which was surprising since it was 1pm on a Thursday afternoon. But regardless, the weather was nice so we decided to go walk around the neighborhood to waste the time. By the time we had gotten back the place was a little more crowded. There are limited seats, so if you and your group want to sit and eat, make sure to grab a few seats and wait it out there.I shared a regular pie ($25) to share with 2 other people. If you're hungry, try the sicilian square pie ($30) which seems to be bigger and looks a bit more hearty.When your pie arrives to the front desk, expect the owner to sprinkle a generous amount of fresh parmesan and fresh cut basil atop the pizza. By the time you carry it to your table the fresh parmesan cheese will have melted.The pizza was absolutely delicious. And be warned by other reviewers and myself, the pizza is very greasy/oily. I am the type that usually does dab the pizza with a few napkins to get the extra grease off, but I just couldn't do it here. I wanted to taste all the flavors and I didn't regret my decision at all. Best of all was that the pizza lasted fresh till my last bite. The crust didn't dry out and everything was baked to perfection.",10/10/2010,22,214,79,WkAIcPWrsG_i8tNHllmfEA

2712,Bob P.,0.0,1,"I read the reviews. I was aware of the wait times. I knew that sometimes the pizza came out of the oven burnt. Man were those understatements... I got there, meeting a friend at 6:30. They opened at 6:50. 10 minutes early (for a 6:30 start time....) We were 4 and 5 in line. We got our round slices at 7:10. They were not too bad. The basil made the slices pretty good. Now, for the next 20 minutes, we alongside 14 others sat around waiting for Lord knows what, while the restaurant continuously filled with the odor of burnt flour and dough. When our squares finally arrived, they were less than appealing. We both wished they had come out first because they were so disappointing. The crust was hard and tasteless, and burnt on top of that. It sat like lead in my stomach. It was really hard to catch the flavor of the sauce, cheeses and basil over that burnt crust. I was willing to make the pilgrimage knowing full well what was in store. I would do it again if the pizza beat Dominoes, but in my opinion, it doesn't.I really have no idea how this place ever got 5 stars. The quality must be falling off in Dom's later years. I do some crazy things for food. I'll still drive to Philly from Long Island on a whim for a real cheese steak. I'll plan a weekend trip in Maine around a lobster roll.

2713,Dina D.,1.0,5,"Di Fara Pizza is definitely a special pie worth waiting for.  Just as much a star of the show as the pizza is the pizzaiolo Dominick DeMarco.  DeMarco alone makes his pizzas. Right before your eyes, he snips off fresh basil onto your pizza and pours a generous amount of olive oil on top as well as a large sprinkling of grated cheese.  These quality  toppings make for an extra special pizza--although the pizza itself is wonderful.  The dough is thin and perfectly executed.  Of course, the downside to Di Fara is the wait, which I thought would be longer based on reading the reviews.  I went at noon on a Wednesday and my pizza was ready within an hour.  I got it to go, as the dining room is VERY small and people seem to grab a table and sit there even if they are not eating.  I thought I did the right thing getting there at opening, but it pays to get there even earlier and secure a seat.  In addition, there is no restroom there so plan accordingly.  I had heard Dominick was like the soup nazi but not at all.  I told him I had come from NC to try his pizza and he was very pleased and happy--seems like a sweet man to me who likes making food the way it SHOULD be made.  Based on what I know about pizza, you can't judge a pizza by ordering just a slice.  The slices take about 20 minutes here, but it is worth getting a whole pie.  If you are desperate for a place to eat it, the Q platform has a nice little ""table"" where you can eat waiting for your train for a quintessential NY dining experience.  I heard from a local on the platform that Dominick may be throwing in the towel soon and it's not certain if his kids will be taking over the place, so RUN to get your pizza soon.",8/19/2010,76,1044,14,2tyq9mcWU7JzMmyWK8xOcA

(first time i ever went it was about 100 degrees out. very poor decision on my part.)-yes, the square pies will catch fire & fill the room up with smoke. i suggest taking breaks for fresh air outside.-go plain. i'm a purist & think its the only way to go. so do it.-DO NOT go here expecting to ""pop in for a slice"". it will more than likely take longer than you expect it to. -you're a fool for ordering a slice here anyway. your supposed to order pies. duh.-if you go for a slice, it will more than likely take 2x as long because Dom isn't so quick to keep the slices ready to dish out. there's a list. and an order. learn that. and if you INSIST on ordering a slice, order two. because you WILL want more than one after you finish it.-come before opening. line up. the pizza tour will jump in front of you any way you cut it, so be smart and show up before doors open after their mid-afternoon break.-never, ever, ever complain. you are LUCKY to be at DiFara. you are being given the privilege of eating the best pizza on the face of the earth. give the man a little respect.-if you have low sugar or act like a jerk when you're starving, bring a snack.-be polite. don't bug the man or his family when your order will be ready, because they don't want to hear it. take a peek at the list yourself and see how many names before yours have yet to be crossed off. this means: stay near the counter.-don't forget to say please and thank you and give him a sincere smile. he deserves much more than that, so don't be a jerk. you dear patron, are not any better than any other body walking in through that door.-also be sure to check their facebook to find out if they are open. they have been closed on Mondays & Tuesdays randomly and it would sure be a pity to travel all the way out there only to find out that they are closed.",8/19/2010,9,32,4,sx2LC2530Q0ZEUQ762h9vg

2731,Lenny M.,0.0,3,"Sigh. If this were a few years ago I would have given this 5 stars. It really pains me to drop it to 3.This was the most amazing slice you could find. What has changed? Last time I was here Dom had put so much parm on it all I could taste was sharpness and salt. This is not uncommon now. A few years ago the flavors would marry in such a way that only a craftsman could accomplish. I boasted that this Pizza is an excellent way to train your palette.  Waiting that long for a quality pie was worth it then. Today, not so much when the quality is a gamble.  1 star removed from the 5 I would have given.A few years ago I had waited 3 hours for a pie and that was part of the novelty, and I could not complain because the quality warranted such a wait. Now the ingredients are still as fantastic, the wait still as long if not longer and the price, well the price has skyrocketed as well. I remember when the price went up to $5 bucks a slice, then $6 and I thought well that makes sense, its easier to take pie orders and not have to deal with individual slices. Hell, Totonno's does it, why not DiFara's, especially when you can still get a pie for less than $24. Last I heard it was $29 for a pie and I can't justify that, not when the quality is such a gamble. 1 more star deducted.I can't take any more stars off because DiFara's is still good and a great experience, just not worth the time and the wait anymore.Visit it once, but realize you're going to experience only a shadow, or better yet an echo of a pie that would be the gold standard of NYC pizza a few years ago. But so it goes. It's impossible to retain the quality of the pizza that depends entirely on Dom's skilled hands. I won't be dropping by though, I'd rather not see DiFara's coast on its reputation when there's 2 old favorites and a fantastic new-comer so close by.",2/21/2011,14,20,1,hYBwX8cOzg-_HAQ6X4dbsg

The dough was thin, the crust was dry and didn't offer much taste nor did it compliment the toppings, sauce or cheese. After the pizza was taken out of the oven they added the cheese and cut up some basil on top.The pizza was amazingly oily. The cheese was fresh and tasted better than a typical pizza place. The sauce wasn't anything special.I have no idea what others see in this place and the high ratings. I don't think my taste buds took a day off or anything so I have to say I totally agree with all other reviewers that were not only disappointed but felt they were had by the charge of $5 a slice for average pizza!",6/20/2011,23,6,0,4_lDd6a6yFF3Wnuxog5BBA

When we walked off the train, we immediately saw the line at the door, waiting for the place to open. While waiting, I figured why not get a slice. We walked in and seen the $5 ticket. As we were walking out, I thought it just might be worth it. After all, there were tourist that were taking pictures of each other in front of the place where I least expected it. After a second look, I saw the guy had great ingredients so we took a chance. I am so glad that we did. The first pie came out and he cut fresh basil off the vine onto the pizza. I wait for about 20 minutes for a slice that was simply incredible. I can't wait to go back with a few friends for a pie and a video.

I'd seen the painting of Domenico De Marco sprinkling mozzarella onto his pies one by one, and so to see him in person like a painting come to life, was impressive. Just like that time I saw Katy Perry at KidRobot. De Marco's main help is a man whose back has the curve of a pizza-maker. His hunchback is a sign of his committment to their pies, but unfortunately the ordering process that he oversees is a jumble. There is no line, which is at the same time endearing and infuriating. A owned-and-operated business like this usually excels in customer service, but I (and other noobs) found it difficult to order. It took an hour to get two square slices at 3pm on a Saturday. Maybe nothing tastes good after such a long wait, but I was (saddeningly) underwhelmed.

I don't know what is the big deal with all the hype. The pizza was badly burnt. Needing to scrape charcoal off the pizza is already not perfect. The ingredients used show the potential of the pizza to be as good as they say, but the end result wasn't.The pizza was soggy. I had to eat with utensils. I don't mind the wait, but I'd want something that at least lives up to 50% of the hype and justify the $5 price of a slice. The pizza at DiFara's is probably not what it used to be.*** Revision 12/9/2009I went back to Di Fara on a day that had no lines during lunch. Without the pressure of time to satisfy a line of eaters and without the summer heat, this time Dom pretty much got it right. No overly burnt crusts. Still, I almost had to ask for a fork because it was too oily to pick up. I think the pizza is still a bit too salty and too oily, but the sauce was delicious and full of flavor. The basil had better effect this time. The crust was decent, though slightly chewy. I also tried the Sicilian, which was heavy on the cheese. I liked the thick crunchy crust, but with so much cheese, I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much. Very oily.I'm glad I gave Di Fara another try. Still... $5/slice?*** Revisit 12/2/2010One year later, it is still $5/slice. I had another slice and it wasn't as good as I last remembered. The pizza wasn't crispy. The slice of pizza is very small. The sauce wasn't as flavorful. The end crust was crunchy but too burnt to eat -- and I love end crusts. Nothing stood out for me this time. Di Fara has been good 1 out of 4 times I've been here, and that's not a mark of consistency. The emperor's not wearing clothes, folks. If I want a slice, I know where to go: Joe's.*** Revision 3/4/2012If I want a slice, I'd go to Patsy's. Best pizza for the price.

JUST FORGET IT. you need to camp here. but i'm going to tell you that it sucks if you can't make it out here and troop the wait because truthfully it will be the best pizza in your life. salty, fresh, crispy, aromatic, everything a pizza should be!!! you can smell it coming off the train station! i love how he has his walls plaqued with awards and recognitions. its amazing to see how my local pizza shop can turn into this sensation!! difara has my heart .. and my stummy haha",3/1/2012,6,942,497,65qbB9h_uLvS5JTiC-g-0A

I can't verify the scientific reasons why a gas oven is considered worse than a brick oven, but I can say the Difara crust is very close to my weak gas-ovened home pizzas and nothing like neapolitan (Difara uses a very conventional slot gas pizza oven).  - Expensive.  Most ""quaint obscure Yelp-Hype"" spots are dirty, cramped and CHEAP.  But this place is dirty, cramped, and 2x the cost of the best Manhattan pizza spots.  I feel bad for the neighborhood people who have lived nearby for decades.  They probably used to be able to drop in and say hi and get their friday night pizza, now they gotta fight with NYU Yelp whores armed with $2000 DSLRs, Japanese Hipsters and Kiwis on holiday just to get a slice of the pie.",1/10/2007,17,44,5,YUXZsOz_Pl__mwlLs4B1xg

2790,Mark T.,0.0,5,"313'th proud yelp fan- the investment of an hour wait and $25 for a regular olive oil and basil pie, brought an awesome payout; First a show which I'll probably never see anything in similarity, in which the one man band owner Dominico DeMarco 74 years old [fara was a partner until 1978], works his magic since 1964 with a oven that handles peacefully 4 pies at once, it's purely magical, just live forever and keep making pizza. Than the pizza arrives, if feels like you've won the lottery, than the scissors cutting some fresh basil and some extra grated cheese moves in, and the plan to sell the other half pizza for the desperate people behind us in line suddenly seemed like a 100 billion dollar ponzi scheme. Yes, it is the most expensive regular slice at $5 each, it is the most antique, to say the least, it is a one man band restaurant, snail paced speed, it has retired exhaust fans, tearing up the eyes, it is bathroom or sink free to fight the remaining olive oil, yet all impatient energizer-bunny infused brooklynites come to serve their share of wait time, I think I've a clue why.",7/8/2009,333,248,352,lPxPlRORP5xMqXP2XcIUGQ

2800,Fong L.,0.0,4,"easily the best new york pizza I've ever had.as any true pizza connoisseur knows, you judge a NY pizza by the plain (cheese) slice, and theirs was the best I've ever had.The process (I watched Dom work his magic)First, he works the crust.  I have no idea how he gets it so thin, but there it is.  thinnest crust I've ever had.Then he ladels on the sauce:  just enough, and not too sweet, not too sour.next is the best part.  the cheese:  mozzarella sliced onto the pie directly, then spread evenly.  freshly grated romano (I think) cheese scattered by hand.  fresh mozzarella torn apart by hand and spread around the pizza.  just before he puts the pizza in the oven, he pours olive oil on top with a can with a long thin spout.after about 10-15 minutes, he takes the pizza out, cuts it up, then scatters some more fresh romano on, drizzles some more olive oil on top, and then gets a pair of scissors and cuts FRESH BASIL on top of the pizza.  just like the classic marguerite style neapolitan.THe result:  a complicated, nutty cheese flavor with the perfect amount of stringiness on paper thin crust and perfect sauce.  damn.The only problem I have with the whole experience, was the wait.  I am supremely grateful that Dom bumped my order in line so I could make my flight, and have his ambrosia-riffic slice of pizza.  He's a really nice old man, probably making pizza the same way for 30+ years.  He's just a little bit busy with all the people waiting and the pizza to make.  however with a 1 hour + wait that everyone I asked in line had, I think there could be an improvement made with the process.  Then.... well there's the environment for the wait.  Walking in the hole-in-the wall, you get rained on by the air conditioning, dripping into a bucket as you walk in.  thing is, it's actually disturbingly refreshing after waiting inside, with the heat, smoke, and smell of burned flour inflaming your eyes, and a few folding tables scattered around the interior.  One of the fridges for cold drinks was broken even.I say this to prepare you.  Prepare to wait a while for the best slice of NY you've ever had.  Prepare for the wait and the smoke.  If they just fixed the place up a little (at least just the air), I'd easily give it 5 stars.",7/13/2008,707,283,57,fdVCBVz4VWLo2bMbPsco9Q

Forget the pilgrimage on the Q. It is a 1/2 day you'll never get back, all for a slice of pizza. The owners are a family of prodigious pizza savants and I say that in the most pejorative of ways. The daughter that acts as the order taker and cashier is a space-shot. She was forgetting orders and giving the wrong change and wrong pizzas to patrons. I also witnessed her confuse two Asian women for the other- ahhhwkward. I watched the brother, that lives in the back, attempt to kick an agitated diner out, who then proceeded to call the owners, "" dirty guineas."" The brother just sits in the back and slices toppings on an as-needed basis and delivers each batch to his father on a dirty plate. I waited 45 minutes for 2 slices that were tasty, but not worth the back ache. They cook as though they are at home making each pizza like it was their first time. There are too many things wrong with DiFara's: - The oven cooks unevenly -The place is unsanitary and I'm being kind. If I wasn't sure the oven was 650 degrees and capable of killing all bugs, I never would have eaten there. The place really is filthy and I have to believe the BoH is bribed on a regular basis. -A slice is 4 bucks and it isn't a big slice. I feel like customers are being robbed of money and worse, precious time. All reports indicate that Domenico and his pizza children crank out 300 pizzas a day, 7 days a week. Conservative math has DiFara's grossing 1.5 million dollars a year. You know he lives in Larchmont and drives a customized Escalade. As an artisanal cheesemaker, I am a big supporter of Slow Food and timeless methods of preparation, but DiFara's is ridiculous. I think they have everyone fooled.Oh yeah, the pizza is good, but no better than any pizzeria within 1 km of the Campo dei Fiori or Pepe's.

2806,Scott W.,0.0,5,"DiFara just may be the favorite pizzeria of New York pizza maniacs.  People flock there even though it's hidden in the middle of Brooklyn's Midwood section, at least a few subway stops away from other attractions.  The magic of DiFara lies within the four-caked hands of Domenico Demarco.  Save a few moments of dough prep, Dom is the only person who will touch your pizza before you.  The process starts when he flattens  the dough and ladles on a thin skin of his superbly fruity-sweet sauce.  He does so slowly and with great intent.  The sauce is made from imported San Marzano tomatoes.  He even uses the box as a step stool for help reaching the upper oven.  Next, Dom slices fresh fior di latte (cows' milk mozzarella) directly onto your pie and arranges them with the eye of a true artist.  Next, he reaches for a brine-filled bag of mozzarella di bufala (mozzarella from Italian water buffalo) and pulls the ball apart, distributing bits of the heavenly cheese throughout the surface.  Just before putting the pizza into his oven (the center seems to be a favorite of Dom's) he drizzles top notch olive oil atop the pie.  The test of each pie's readiness come with a crust pinch from Dom himself.  Pies usually bake in about 6-8 minutes, which is nothing compared to the time you've already spent waiting for the pie.  When it's done, Dom will remove it from the oven with his bare hands.  This is totally badass.  Watch how the cheese pulsates like fresh magma oozing in a volcanic pool.  Just in time to awaken you from a state of deep hypnosis, Dom dumps a handful or two of freshly shredded grana padano.  Next, he drizzles yet another helping of olive oil onto the pizza's surface.  This incorporates all three cheeses into one cohesive community of flavor.  Finally, Dom grabs a beautiful bouquet of fresh basil and snips bits of it onto your pie.  It makes me weep.  One time I saw him remove a bit he didn't like and replace it with a more pleasing shred.DiFara also provides a dish of peppers and extra grana padano upon request.  There are both Italian and American sodas available with a couple bottle openers on the counter.  If you're lucky, Dom will have one of his opera cassettes playing while you wait patiently for your pizza.TIPS:- Don't be afraid to place your order as soon as you can grab the attention of Dom or whichever of his children are working.- Maintain eye contact with anyone behind the counter so they don't forget about you.  Just don't be rude.- Don't come hungry, come excited.- Smile, you're about to eat some heavenly pie.",2/15/2008,11,26,3,6KD14C7X1bFp6dOFWZf73g
2807,Thomas H.,0.0,5,"I'm a long time listener, first time caller on DiFara's.  What makes this place unique is not only the quality of the pizza, which you've heard tell of so often (the scissor-snipped basil, the San Marzano tomatoes, the cheese, the magical crust/oven calculus), but the respect that the customers show to DeMarco and each other.  Nobody cuts lines, nobody gets rowdy for waiting, and everybody pays a type of silent reverence.  The worst part is people who sit down and camp out at tables, waiting for their pie orders, eating pastries from across the street complaining about the wait.  Order, wait for your pizza, pay, sit down, eat and leave. I think (no experience with toppings) that you should either order the pizza with no toppings or only one.  Any more and you run the risk of soggy crust.  The square pies/slices are unique and a little burned ( the pie was blackened and *burning* coming out of the oven), but amazingly crunchy. The round pies/slices highlight the delicate crust better.  Plus, seeing a man pull a pizza from a 700+ degree oven WITH HIS BARE HANDS is pretty spectacular.  Definitely linger around the counter to make sure that your order is getting taken care of.",3/27/2008,2,22,0,jk2glxI8mDt-1wwt5KOOZA

2811,Billy G.,0.0,5,"If you listen to food critics like Zagat, they frequently say DiFara is the best pizza in the city. If you listen to the hype of foodies who've made the trek to Midwood, Brooklyn, you'll hear the same thing. Can so many people be wrong?  In a word, no. But I don't defer to others' opinions on why this pizza is the best or how long people traveled to get there. I base my humble opinion on my taste only and the hundreds of places I've sated my addiction to this simple yet complex food, pizza. Piece for piece, pound for pound or what have you, Dom DeMarco's oblong magnum opus is simply the best and well worth the trip.I grew up not far from this place's location so I was well acquainted with DiFara's product long before the din of ooohs and ahhhs brought in the barbarian hordes. My brother found this place which looks like a typical old school pizzeria, maybe worse on first glance. In fact, I might not even have gone in initially had I not been told to ignore the outer (and maybe the inner) appearance. Disregard the looks of the place as it's merely a mirage, I assure you Nirvana lies therein.I'll start with the biggest bitch most people have about DiFara's, the God damned bullshit wait one must have to endure to get a slice of pizza. Actually getting a slice might be easier, I usually order a whole pie which is often much more time consuming. For those of you not yet schooled in Dom's place, the pizza is made by one man who is, at best, slow and steady. I have often waited well in excess of an hour and a half to get a pie. Why in the mecca of pizza, Brooklyn, would I subject myself to this type of torture? Why it's the pizza and it's worth the wait. My Father said it years ago, you've got to go there when you're full just so you'll be hungry by the time you eat. One suggestion, if you're starving or don't have an hour to an hour and a half to kill, don't bother. Maybe you'll get lucky and there will be an ebb and flow of customers but play the odds and prepare for a lengthy wait.Dom used to serve lunches and dinners with 1 or 2 of his 7 children working the back kitchen. Although pizza is Dom's forte', his dinners were similarly good and worth checking out. He used to make a large dinner type salad with Italian antipasto type meats and cheeses, also worth checking out. Dom also used to make rustic Italian peasant food like stewed rabbit, if the meat was fresh. He buys all his meats fresh daily so if he's serving it, it's good to go. Getting a dinner also used to be a great wait to short curcuit the long wait for pizza.Why is DiFara's pizza the best? Initially it's the ingredients. Dom uses only the best imported ingredients including extra virgin olive oil (which is draped over the steaming pie when it exits the oven). Dom also uses buffalo mozzerella which is imported from Italy at great cost. You can see the styrofoam packing crates nearby so it's no joke, this stuff comes in from JFK directly from Italia. This stuff along with domestic fresh mozzerella is combined to create a wonderful creamy crown to the pizza.Dom also uses imported Grana Padano cheese in lieu of the more commonly seen Parmagiano Reggiano, which he grinds and sprinkles over the top of the bubbling pie when it's removed from the oven. The sauce is homemade, of course, there's no bulk made crap here. It's made daily (or semi daily) from imported San Marzano tomatoes, grown in the soil surrounding Mt. Vesuvius. The sauce has a rich sweetness which isn't found in other sauces using other types of tomatoes.  All these ingredients are high in cost individually which is why a slice of Dom's pizza is $4. This cost is passed onto the consumer but if you're a pizza afficianado like I am, you'll find it worth it. There's plenty of slice shops in NY but they don't taste like this.  As far as what to order, Dom has a lot of specialty toppings which all sound great. And they are great as I've tried most of them but it's just that this product doesn't need any accouterments. It's that good au natural. Additionally, the Neopolitan slice is far too thin to support much weight so order with this in mind. There's also a large calzone that can come with imported proscuitto which ruins about $20-$22. A few guys can gorge off this, it's pretty large. The cheese is wonderfully rich and runny, not the gloppy and clumpy mess that you'll find in most pizza place calzones. This stuff is fresh as fresh can be. Dom also snips fresh basil onto his hot pies which got him in trouble with the Dept. of Health but it SO adds to the taste.In addition to growing up on Brooklyn pizza, I've tried nearly all of the ""best"" pizzas in NY so my opinion of this place is based on a lot of trial and error. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for cheap eats or a quick pizza fix, go elsewhere. But if you want some of the best pizza you'll ever have AND have time to kill, venture off to Avenue J in Brooklyn and bite the bullet.

2818,Travis M.,0.0,5,"I distinctly remember my first trip to Di Fara's, I had moved out to the Big Apple all the way from SoCal not too long ago and after getting used to my surroundings, I decided to explore the wonders the city had to offer. It was a hot afternoon and I was a little lost way out on the Q train all the way down to Avenue J in search of the fabled Di Fara Pizza, only to find this little humble joint right in front of me after I got off the train. I entered confusedly, a bit disappointment even; this didn't seem any different from all the other pizzerias I'd been to in NYC. The only indication of the fame I had heard of this unassuming abode was the history of awards and raving reviews hung sporadically over the walls. Admittedly, I was taken back by the prices on the menu, $5 for a base slice seemed a bit crazy, but I had already managed to come so far so might as well. It was small and cramped, I barely managed to get myself a little wobbly table in the corner as I waited for my slice. Boy, did I wait too. I watched as Mr. Domenico Demarco slowly make my special square slice topped with porcini mushrooms and each step he took to complete my meal made me all the more enthralled to dig right in. Finally, my slice was finished, I quickly picked it up from the counter and took a brief second to feast my eyes at the peculiar wonder before me. Never before had I seen such a deep slice sloppily oozing Parmesan cheese mixed laboriously with a thick saucing topped with fresh smelling basil and my wonderful porcini mushrooms. I could not hold back myself any longer from the hunger pains rising in my stomach, so I opened my mouth excitedly and bit in. From that moment on, my life had changed. I opened my eyes wide as the wondrous mix of flavors bathed my mouth in sheer savory. I could never go back to the ""dark ages"" when I could consider frozen pizza a delectable treat. This was the true pizza experience that all the fame around Di Fara's proclaimed loud and clear, it was all true, so very, very true! I will never forget that experience and despite since then I've come to eat there many, many times, that same heavenly taste remains ever stronger with each and every bite. This may not be your typical review, but that's because Di Fara's isn't quite your typical place and it cannot be described in a normal fashion by any means. Truthfully, it is small, cramped, messy, expensive, a bit out of the way, and owns to legendarily long waits! Yet, all that said and done, the place feels very homely, Mr. Demarco & Co. always greets me with a smile and are very willing to engage in friendly discussions when they can, it feels like a place where one can be taken back to a simpler time and simply enjoy some tantalizing pizza. Di Fara's is one of the true shining gems New York City has to offer and any self respecting pizza lover should make a trip down to experience a slice for themselves for, as the tagline perfectly states, it truly is ""worth the wait!""",12/10/2011,3,6,0,NI3pQBCRI3kJrc04rHJP3A
2819,Mark K.,0.0,5,"Best pizza I've ever eaten, hands down. We ordered in advance and drove down to avoid the wait. The pizza was crisp and fresh. Every pie is sprinkled with fresh romano and parmesan when it comes out, as well as fresh basil and olive oil. We were in pizza heaven. Words don't do this pizza justice, just go and try it for yourself.",8/24/2010,439,85,1,khw-jEC1yU2IXvpw-1FGpQ
2820,Lee H.,0.0,5,"Everything that can be said about the famed Di Fara's has been said, so I'll reiterate the 3 things you really need to know about this place.- It is f---ing old school. If you aren't sure whether your favorite pizza is being made by Mario and Luigi or by Mike and Leeroy, or you just want experience something truly authentic... this is the place to go. Dom can be heard mumbling Italian to himself from time to time as grabs pies out of the 750 degree oven with his bare hands, having lost the capacity to feel heat after so many years of hard work in the kitchen. This is pizza.- The wait can be long. You'll walk in, see 20 people inside and think to yourself, ""Hey, this doesn't seem bad..."" but don't be fooled. Dom makes every single pie himself. Yes. Every one of them. So, while having only a couple dozen patrons ahead of you may not seem daunting, at approx 5 minutes a pie (crafting time), you're likely looking at a 1-1.5 hour wait.  - The SLICE: The Traditional ($20, $3 toppings) is a thin crust, crispy bottom (sorry to all the pizza folders out there) made from the best ingredients you can get. Apparently Dom gets the cheese shipped in from his hometown in Italy. Be warned though, the chef is a bit heavy handed with the Olive Oil. After the sauce and cheese have been put into place on the dough, Dom goes to work with the oil, liberally applying (borderline drenching) before the pie hits the oven. When the pie is done cooking Dom will famously add his finishing touch: a generous handful of basil cut with scissors over top of the pie, another handful of cheese tossed on... then again with the oil! This time an even bigger dose. 10-15 seconds of pouring oil on top of the cooked pizza. It's hard to say that anything Dom does is wrong, but it is just a little too much oil for me, and for the pie as well. It's otherwise sturdy, crispy crust is smothered and soggy towards the middle of the pie from so much oil. In the end, a little too much oil doesn't stand in the way of the most delicious piece of pizza you'll ever shovel down your throat after a 2 hour wait. And as a side note, as you watch Dom pull pizza after pizza out of the oven you may think to yourself ""Man, that kind of looks burnt..."" but don't worry. Every single finished pie looks burnt on one side, merely as a result of a uneven oven one would assume. But what appears to be burnt is actually perfectly cooked...it's something you truly need to eat for yourself to believe. PS- We ordered the Di Fara's Specialty last night (sausage, peppers, red onions, mushrooms) as they were out of pepperoni. Let me tell you... I have never had such perfectly cooked vegetables on a pizza. It was truly one of the best slices I have ever had.",5/8/2009,4,12,0,XajPuRDj4QiI2eIAM_Nj9A

2825,Wendy C.,0.0,5,"This mom & pop type place obviously is not as romantic as Lucali's in Carroll Gardens, but give DeMarco some appreciation for keeping it exactly the same way it has been for the last 40+ years...a ""hole in the wall"" in sync with the Midwood character (very old Brooklyn). This is the best pizza I've ever had. I ordered a plain slice with basil. The crust is super thin, crispy, and does not get soggy towards the center. The taste is slightly better than Lucali's thanks to the stronger flavor of basil. At Lucali's, they added the basil onto the pizza once it came out of the oven. At DiFara's, the basil goes into the oven with the pizza. There is only 1 person making (as well as slicing) all that pizza for the 1000+ people who wait on line everyday. There is not a single helper except for the girl who operates the register, folds the boxes, and answers the phone. I'm glad DeMarco didn't open a second location in Manhattan or expand into a chain. I wouldn't trust anyone else to make pizza the way that made him so famous. Goodfellas used to make great pizza a few years back from their Staten Island location, but the quality suffered severely from ""chain reaction"" when they decided to open up another location in Bay Ridge. The crust was thick & chewy, cheese was gummy, and it had the flavor of a deli pizza. They had the name to keep themselves afloat, but they couldn't find the right people to make pizza the Goodfellas way.",10/9/2008,0,303,23,Vv_QNh9H-gTF9WabR5vH3g

I do remember it being edible food and satiable enough for my stomach.I was so hungry while I waited for the hyped up pizza that I wanted to steal a slice from the obnoxious group's table and run out of there yelling, ""Suck it!""  I wanted to eat a frozen Tombstone pizza and feel just as satisfied. I can chop some basil and pour some olive oil over that frozen crud. It didn't matter to me.

2835,Adam W.,0.0,5,"Myself and two of my friends just got back from Di Fara. And it was well worth the trek to Avenue J in Brooklyn to do so. Acknowledging that there would be a considerable wait, we set off from Manhattan around 5:00 and arrived outside Di Fara around 5:45 or so, before they opened for the 6-9pm dinner shift. We walked around the block and came back to a short line which formed outside the restaurant before it opened. It took about 10 minutes, then we got our order for a sausage and pepperoni square pie in. I picked up a Pepsi from the refrigerator and paid for the pizza while my friends got one of the very few seats in the place. There really wasn't any ambiance whatsoever and the service was a bit convoluted, but we began eating somewhere around 6:40.The food was absolutely fantastic. Although the square pie wasn't like any conventional pizza I've had before, it was masterfully crafted. The crust was somewhat thick and a bit dense, and even though the outer edges of the crust were charred, all of the crust was scrumptious. The large chunks of fresh mozzarella(you can watch the guy drain the fluid from the mozzarella bag as he's making your pizza) complemented the crust very well with its stringiness and light taste. The sauce had a very smooth consistency and also tasted great. What really set this pizza apart in my opinion was the generous amounts of olive oil and fresh basil which topped it off -- these made the pizza especially delicious. Also, as a bunch of college students, my friends and I were worried that the rather small-looking square pizza we had just paid $36 for wouldn't be enough to fill us up. On this point, we were most definitely mistaken -- I couldn't even eat my third of the last slice in the box. Even though everything here seems expensive, you get a lot of food for the price.As for whether or not it's better than Grimaldi's, I honestly can't say. It seems like a cop-out, but the circular pizzas at Grimaldi's and the square pizzas at Di Fara are just different enough that it becomes like a comparison between tuna tartar and beef carpaccio -- both somewhat similar in form, but different enough to make them beyond comparison. While the service and ambiance were lacking at best, the food here was good enough to get a five-star rating out of me.",8/27/2008,15,152,1,dPJHJQvtSYjFykTH--yrFw

Each usually only takes 10-15 min in that hot oven.  They are all made with buffalo mozzarella, some type of parmesan, a sweet tomato sauce blend of fresh and canned toms, and fresh home-grown basil which is cut into pieces over the pie with scissors right when it comes out of the oven.  Oh and did i mention that for extra flavor there is a special olive oil sprinkled over the pizza before it hits the oven?  Don't let that ""grease"" drip off......it's amazing.  Okay so back to the review........this pizza was great.  I prefer the round slice over the square but they are both exceptionally good....if not great......or perfection.  The square piece has a different sauce....it's chunkier and tangier than the round slice.....but no less delicious.  Both types of slices are $5 a piece..... but if you trek all the way out here you better effin try both.  Even though the pieces are somewhat modest, you will be full.  Well at least I was, and I had just come from a workout so i was starving!!Anyways this place is one that lives up the the hype and then some.  F*cking spectacular.  Stop whining about the distance and get your ass out to Ave J you pansies......stop being such f*ckin borough snobs.  Good food has no borders.",8/6/2008,62,164,9,ixaD3AHrHFgxtQwX_SMu-g

2849,F C.,0.0,4,"I stopped at Di Fara on a Saturday afternoon on my way to Coney Island to try the pizza.  The place and mr DeMarco are as old school as it gets. The old man crafts every single pizza himself at a speed that would desperate a snail.  He uses three cheeses (Buffalo mozzarella from Caserta, Fior di Latte and fresh ground Parmigiano Reggiano), homemade San Marzano tomato sauce, and generous doses of fresh basil and olive oil.  There seems to be some science to the disposition of ovens -- it seems he uses three ovens, an open fire one, and two regular, probably at different temperatures --, and moves the pizzas around from one to another, but I didn't have time to investigate. I read in another review that in the past he would put the ingredients in the pizza in stages, taking the pizza out of the oven a few times, which makes sense to me to get the perfect crust and at the same time ensure all ingredients cook well, so this could be a faster way that imitates the original.So... About the pizza... Slices are small, and cost $5. The full pie goes for $25, which all in all is comparable to most other pizza places that carry a premium (e.g. Motorino).  I liked it very much, but I like thin crust, crunchy pizza with few toppings, oily, and bold in flavor -- which is pretty much the tech specs of DiFara's pies.  However, I'm not sure I'd come here very often: the wait time is atrocious, it is in the middle of nowhere, and there is very limited seating space.",6/20/2010,5,21,0,1x-wN3gtQ9C9RvcEmAgdHw

2852,Matthew L.,0.0,3,"Me and John went here on his last day at Lutheran (woot!). So yea, as you all know, this is supposedly one the big pizza spots to go to... supposedly. It seemed like it was a lot of hype to me. I will say this: the sauce is the BEST I have ever had on any pizza. It has a nice kick to it, I don't really know how to describe it, but once you taste it, you'll be hooked. This place takes forever. Not a good thing for your typical on-the-go New Yorker. People were waiting more than 15 minutes just for a slice. I know it's cool to have that old guy hand make all your pizzas, but he looks like he's about to fall over, the guy seems so tired. I guess that's why the hours are so weird. He probably has a nap every afternoon or something. It's long past due that he passed the torch. We ordered the square ""special""' (Sausage, peppers, mushroom, onions). It took literally 45 minutes till our pizza was ready. The old man puts fresh parmesan and basil on the pies, which is a nice touch. The oil that he sprinkles under the crust is not a good thing. The pie gets pretty soggy, pretty quick. We ate there, but if you had to commute home and then eat it, it would probably be a soggy mess. Not good eats! The crust seemed pretty dense, just much different from the rest of the ""Best"" pizza spots. The toppings were not symmetrically placed, some slices were pretty empty, some had too much toppings. I felt that the pizza was average at best, definitely not mind-blowing. The ""regular"" pizza looked like I would have enjoyed it a lot more (it's the regular thin crust). Maybe we messed up by getting the ""Square"" pizza, ironic since it costs $5 more. But yea, after the long wait for the expensive ass pizza, I won't be going back, so I'll never know.I don't normally take price into account, but if I did, I would take away another star. $5 a slice is pretty extreme, and the wait is ridiculous.

2866,Stephanie B.,0.0,5,"This is easily the best pizza place in all of New York City. Lucali is compared to Di Fara but it is not even close. Di Fara's has been around so long it should be an institution of NYC. The setting for this landmark is not sexy, but when it comes down to the pizza- it's nothing more than the best.For a slice the charge is $4, but I would pay $10. That's how good it is. You may have to wait a little while but that's because old man Dom takes his time and still uses scissors to cut his basil, that's old school. You can tell he really cares about every single slice and that's all you can really ask for as a customer. As for the pizza, as you may already know the ingredients HAVE TO be imported from Italy because you cannot get that kind of stuff in Brooklyn, let alone Midwood. The crust is perfectly rolled, thrown, or whatever he does. It's not too doughy but not thin where it falls apart when you go to eat it. The sauce is old fashioned but compliments the cheese so well. Dom cuts the cheese with an old school pencil sharpener, or at least that's what it looks like. On top of the Bufalo Mozzarella, when the pizza just comes out of the oven, Dom grates some cheese on top along with olive oil. You usually see those two steps take place before the pizza goes into the oven but once again, this is the old school way in Di Fara's.Basically, the best pizza around right now. This is a glaring example that the old way of doing things still works perfectly fine in 2008.",8/6/2008,2,47,0,jLOX05knoo4h8IQCQFvN2A
2867,Ken K.,0.0,5,"A buddy of mine had recommended Di Fara's before I left for NY, but I wasn't planning on going there because I was already going to Spumoni Gardens and Grimaldi's. But while I was at Spumoni, a guy standing next to us at the counter overheard me and my friend talking about heading over to Grimaldi's afterwards and he adamantly suggested we take a little detour and fit Di Fara's into our itinerary as well. Two strong recommendations from New Yorkers? Fine, I'll go.I'm glad I went. It turned out to be my favorite thin crust pizza in all of New York (and I guess it didn't hurt that there was absolutely no wait on a Thursday evening in December). $5/slice is definitely not normal, so I'm somewhat relieved I don't live nearby. But I'm also sad that I don't live there because I wouldn't mind eating their pizzas every so often. All the toppings (as you've probably read from the other reviews) are fresh, the sauce is sweeter than usual, and I love the cheese and olive oil on top. But what impressed me the most about this pizza was the crust. It's extremely thin and the bottom is slightly crispy from the oven. However, despite how thin the crust is, the bread is still doughy and chewy. I love that! Is the water in NY really that different or is Domenico De Marco just that awesome? I'm guessing it's a little of both since none of the other thin crusts I had in NY were that chewy.Keep it up Signore De Marco!",1/4/2010,311,703,96,K6Z1NU_ofX4yiUqWtV1jNA

After the long subway ride to Brooklyn, the place was right on the corner of the street.The place is very small and has only maybe 5 or 6 tables. Luckily we got a table. It took about 45 minutes to get our pizza after ordering.  We ordered one of the round pizzas, which was about $30 because we added toppings. It's a steep price, but I knew that before going.When I was called to get my pizza, the cook (the only one it seems!) came up with some fresh basil and used some large scissors to cut them over the top.The pizza was great! The pizza at Di Fara is different from what I'm used to (I live on the West coast). But I must say it was well worth the money!  I've had better pizza, but that's only because I'm used to eating the pizza I grew up on here in the West.The edges of the pizza can come out a little burned on some spots, but the pizza is large enough were you can skip those slightly burned areas. The middle is great!  When you bite in to a piece of the basil, it can catch you by surprise. But, that's part of the charm.I would highly recommend Di Fara Pizza if you have quite a bit of time to kill and want to make a special trip out to Brooklyn.PS - CASH only.. they do not accept credit cards or other forms of payment.",1/26/2010,20,91,69,rnlkM-Xe9YJg0i15bmxJQA
2896,Lauren S.,0.0,4,"I'm just waiting for tremendous backlash from DiFara-worshipping Yelpers, as my review lacks that precious fifth star.  And while the pizza was very, very good (and certainly the most entertaining & artistic process I've ever witnessed), I can't bring myself to call it the best pizza in New York.  The wait I'm ok with, the dirt I'm mostly ok with, but when it comes down to it, is it really better than Grimaldi's?  Now first I think I should probably take some responsibility... we ordered too much shit on our pizza - half artichoke/porcini mushroom & half artichoke/pepperoni.  However, getting down to the basics, the cheese was ok, but not enough of it (again, our fault).  I do prefer Grimaldi's cheese, I think.  The sauce is kickass though.  Definitely the best of all the 'best ny pizza' contenders.  Those San Marazano tomatoes and the fresh basil topping are unbeatable.  The crust was pretty good (love those pockets of olive oil), but I prefer the saltiness of Lombardi's crust.  The pizza was very greasy, but I don't have any issue with that.  I've never really understood why pizza loving people don't like grease... it's extra flavor!  And if you're on a diet, you should be skipping pizza altogether! :) As for the toppings, I stole a piece of pepperoni, and it was outstanding (I really need to stop calling myself a vegetarian... it's just so hard to be an adventurous eater and not occasionally sample a tiny piece of meat!).  Artichokes and porcini mushrooms were good, but in the end I think canned artichokes in general are never that great (so I should stop ordering my pizza with them) and the mushrooms were huge, which of course took up room where cheese could be!!The best part of the entire process is watching Dom De Marco mold the dough, lob hunks of fresh romano off a big round and grind by hand, and personally snip fresh basil right over the pizza.  He's inarguably an artisan.  In summary - Sauce: A+++Basil: A+Crust: B+Cheese: A-Other toppings: A-/B+ (love those split grades)",3/8/2007,25,71,1,W7yPqrkbqsRfNL9Klxz6LQ
2897,Matt J.,0.0,4,"You would have thought this place was the Mecca of Pizza the way that people spoke of it. ""People come here from Washington D.C. on business lunches."" ""People wait 2 hours for a pie."" Frankly, if it weren't busy, it maybe worth one more star. When you walk in, you are confronted by a small room which is ""crowded."" The crowd is partly thanks to the small space and coupled by the long waiting time. Apparently the process is so special in making this pizza, that only the fellow behind the counter can create it. That's right, one guy makes the pizza. Now in this little room, there are tables and chairs. Of course there is no actual room to sit down between people who are eating or just waiting. I have seen greater crowds that appear much smaller simply due to the size of the building. Typically, the crowd is moved along more rapidly. Expanding a little and creating more space seems like a great idea. When you finally get the pizza, you can either take it out or patiently wait and ask people if they are done, or if you can play Tetris with the seats until everyone in a party is seated.Now the actual pizza...first the round pie. a big staggering, MEH. The method that the pizza is prepared is different than most other places would make it, this has pros and cons. The pizza is flavorful, but I found myself having trouble maintaining the pizza's structure in order to successfully eat it. In addition to the pizza being different and for that matter, just okay, it was greasy, very greasy. I simply was not impressed. Over to the square pie... HUGE improvement! It is absolutely respectable, there is no denying it. The square pie is much less greasy, although I still has some issues with the structural integrity of the pizza, it wasn't as bad as the round pie. If I were rating just the square pizza on its own, I'd mark it 4.5 stars.Although definitely overrated, it's still very good. I would be delighted if there was room to sit, or the pizza was ready swiftly, these factors definitely take away from the experience. I suppose there is some novelty attached to it being a ""real pizza place in Brooklyn,"" but if you're actually hungry for pizza and don't feel like waiting, look elsewhere. If you don't mind eating the pizza here being an event, go for it.Probably the driving reason why this place falls short of a 5 star review is due to the very real possibility that after waiting for a few hours, the pizza is burned to a crisp.",4/16/2008,23,91,15,eLMe3fYRWaylkUo2mFxOXw

It's ok though b/c that first slice of crunchy pie crust & fresh ingredients, tasted pretty one-of-a-kind. And this is after Dom ran out of basil. Still, how I wished to have been one of the lucky ones to have gotten the perfectly cooked non-burnt-edged pies...The waiting is a culture in itself. I made friends while in line...we formed bonds...seriously. So the waiting itself was actually kind of fun for me. There was one douche bag who cut the line to give his order, which Dom's son didn't seem to catch. Oh, and don't be one of those jerks who runs off with the pie without paying just 'cause Dom's son forgets to get the payment sometimes! These are masterfully made pieces of art that should get at least some compensation, at least to help with the cost of the imported goods.This is a recommended experience for any pizza lover at least once in your lifetime imo.

He uses fresh tomatoes along with canned that is shipped from Italy. He uses the best Mozzarella cheese commercially available. He grinds his own Parmesan and Romano cheeses which he generously sprinkles on the pies before and after he lifts them from the 400 degree oven with his bare hands..That in itself is worth the hour wait for a pie. It is ""Thin Crust"" so you can easily devour a pie with just one other person. He grows oregano in his window of the shop and there is plenty in a jar at the counter to sprinkle on the delightful olive oil he delicately adds as the pie leaves the oven. The wait may be long.

DiFara's  was ok-tasty  because of the fresh herbs he grows on his window sill in the front of the store  and natural Buffalo mozzarella. Thats how pizza should be made... but  its very greasy and sloppy.,their crust is very thin and mushy. I -2 people  can eat an entire pie by themselves thats how thin and light it is. Seriously people! not worth an hour wait or a ride on the subway from the city! READ ON...For many years the place was  in  serious need of a  gut and refurbishing job. So what, you say?....I was told they also offered dishes such as a minestone or vegetable soup/ which he made on some  occasions for certain people on a whim, if you asked .So I ordered a vegetable soup as my husband waited for his pizza. BUT, I made the mistake (or should I say was lucky to witness with my own eyes by ) asking to use their bathroom (after all we were waiting for over an hour !) and was shocked at the over-all conditions of the kitchen behind that door. Everything was older than ancient ! It was disgusting, really!. Besides everything being so ancient (cant be cleaned properly),it was a grimy  roach smorgasborg back there..Sorry to break it to you ! .And as I  squeezed my way passed his VERY surprised son preparing what looked like it could be my vegetable soup- I noticed he was using leftover scraps from other dishes they had prepared, yuck! He was scooping up stuff from what looked like a garbage bin into a pot on the stove! But I thought NOooo, I must SURELY  be mistaken. What am I thinking?! ..When I finally got my soup, a thick stew like meal in a deep bowl- I was sooo disappointed to discover scraps of nothing but vegetable skins  with their stems still on and a few even with their labels intact! My heart sunk. Looking at the long line of people waiting for  their orders- I felt disgusted at what was just served to me,  and ashamed to say anything to this old man who was an icon to these people.Then I was offended. Did they think I wouldnt notice what was in my bowl? ...What happened to Difara's? How can they continue under these conditions and in this manner? What about the health department and inspections?  Needless to say, I have not gone back in 3 years and dont intend to. Has anything changed in this establishment?

2937,Joey C.,0.0,5,"There has to be a reason why Di Fara's gets so much buzz, not just on Yelp, but everywhere else. I first heard about Di Fara's when it was spotlighted on net, for being the most expensive slice in NY. After reading/watching the article, I decide to make it a personal journey to visit this place at least once. And so I did, a few months back, and since those few months that past, I can still say that Di Fara's is it. It is the definitive best pizza in New York. Everything about this place shows tradition and culture. From the small pizza parlor to the ingredients use, it's just simply breath taking. Di Fara's uses the freshest ingredients I have ever tasted on a pizza. The crust is so crisp, but is not tough. The sauce is savory and sweet, but not excessively tangy our sour. The cheese, is warm, soft, and melts in your mouth. It's not hard, rubbery, or excessively thick and chewy. The sprinkle of olive oil helps to intensify and tie the flavors together. It's just a blend of pizza goodness in your mouth. The only downsides to Di Fara Pizza could be the pricing and the wait. But what can you expect? They justify the price because they import the ingredients. I completely agree with them. If you didn't care about the ingredients, then you wouldn't be here. You would be at another local joint, settling for mediocre pizza at 2.75 a pop. The pizza at Di Fara is worth the 5 dollar stipend. Am I telling you to visit this place daily? No, but if you could, I know you would. As for the wait, well, there's a reason why there is a wait, right?",6/11/2010,2,30,7,1OFetODAvloNg9e37TepsA

2941,Tom M.,0.0,5,"I've just read a lot of reviews of di faras and have seen complaints covering a whole lot of issues: namely the time it took you to get there and the time you had to wait for a pizza. You judge a pizza place first and foremost by the pizza itself. If it takes you an hour or six to get there who cares, what's that have to do with the pizza? Regarding the wait, well that's the problem with being a pizza tourist. If there's a line (I go there when there usually aren't any lines) I just leave. If you're in town only for a few days -- well the lines exist because pizza tourists have found the place.Regarding the décor, it is what it is.  It's a hole-in-the-wall.Regarding the price Dominic uses excellent ingrediants. You get what you pay for.Let me just say that Di Fara's today is not what it was a few years ago. Father Time has caught up with Dominic. Five years ago it was perfect all the time. The cornicione (the outer crust) was crispy and chewy at the same time. (Due to uneven thickness). The crust had just the right amount of pull and there was always a perfect blend of cheese, tomato sauce and basil. Now you have a fifty-fifty chance of getting the PERFECT pizza. The other half it's simply good; too much of the cornichione is outright burnt (instead of the crispy) or else the crust may be dry instead of  chewy, or there may be too much oil or not enough basil.If you're a pizza tourist you're in a hard place. Definitely go to say that you went to di fara's but know that you may not always get THE di fara pizza. It's best to go there more than once and the subway is right there. Always get a pie. It's the best value for the money - and after you get the pizza ... wait. Let the cheese and the sauce cool down. Don't eat it straight out of the oven.And go with friends, get a pie at Totonnos (when they reopen), L&B and di Faras. Four people can easily go through 3 pies.",5/27/2009,0,2,0,Hr_VVZAZgnRKYN5h5SkgDQ

About 15-20 minutes from order to mouth.I thought the slice was really very good. Maybe the best I've ever had. I wanted another but there was no room in my gut.

I knew it was going to be a hard search at first, knowing that this is a predominantly religious Jewish area and knowing all the stores will be closed due to the Sabbath. So enjoying the weather and taking a walk, I came across this pizzaria in shocked that there something OPEN I can eat in this area on Saturday. So I went inside and decided to get a slice. Looking at the menu I thought $ 5.00 for a slice was pretty expensive but I decided what the hell! why not go for it. To my amazement, it was an awesome slice of pizza that I bought another slice. I loved everything about, the crust, the sauce, the chesse, the drizzling of olive oil and the fresh basil cut on top. Just simply amazing!!!!!! I had to work at the nursing home several other Saturdays and I am sure you could have guessed what I had for lunch each time.  You guessed it.. DiFara's lol.  I would so come back for a quick lunch with a friend, by myself or bring a pie home. I wouldn't bring a big group to DiFara's because there is not lot of sitting room inside. But if you don't mind waiting then go for it.  I know its always bussy at DiFara's and you could be waiting for a pie for 2 hours but it so worth it... you will not be disappointed!",12/25/2010,64,9,1,RdpS4EdfvH55_LmKwttwDg

But guess what this place actually DOES have the best pizza in New York City. Maybe there's some old dude in Naples who does it better but if you want pizza with fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella and a perfect crispy crust then this is the best in NYC. It's like a cross between the ingredients of Neopolitan style pizza and the crispy crust of New York Style pizza.A friend who is the wealthy, trustfund son of the CEO of a well known marketing firm and lives on Park Avenue came to visit me in Midwood and wanted to take me for a sit down dinner. I could have taken him to the yuppie places on Courtelyou but I gave him a choice between mediocre yuppie food and the best pizza in NYC and he reluctantly agreed. He was scared when people on their stoops said hi, grabbed my arm when I made him walk over the dark Ave. H. overpass late at night and was completely disgusted by the decades old wall stains and balled up napkins that are the Di Fara's decor. He was baffled but charmed by the long line of different Brooklyn types including homeboys, old ladies, Orthodox Jews and Bensonhurst girls in too tight jeans waiting together patiently in total peace and harmony. He couldn't figure out why they were waiting so docilely for pizza and wanted to leave until he, his friend and I got our pie and cleared a table of biohazardous waste to eat it. Everybody sat in stunned silence and hardly said anything except "" Good "" and ""my god good"" until the whole thing was consumed. On the ride back they couldn't talk about anything except the astonishingly good pizza. You know how butter is good? It just has that melty, wholesome goodness. Well the pizza here is good the way butter is good and everything else is margarine. Now my friend keeps pestering me to take the hour long train out to visit me in Midwood (it took him a year to come out the first time) and oh, by the way could we eat at the wonderful pizza place when he comes. I'm pretty close to vegan and I don't even normally like pizza much ( I was indifferent to the famous Sally's in New Haven) but this really is the best pizza.",3/11/2010,0,58,0,H_JehCgqUTZFAabxi2NNxQ

2949,Ryan C.,0.0,5,"Once you get past the fact that Difara's probably has not been cleaned since the Nixon administration, you are in for a real treat by way of the best pizza in New York.  The old man is some kind of genius, with herb garden growing beside the ovens, and his meticulous attention to detail.  Some things in life are worth the wait...like the Jay-Z and Nas reunion *tear*...and a slice from Difara's is equally worth the wait.  I once waited 40 minutes to get a slice, only to devour it in seconds, and then return for a 25 minute wait to get a second slice.  I think your best bet is to spring for a pie, because if you opt for a single slice, you will be left pining for more.  Sitting and waiting has its advantages at Difara, though.  When the joint gets really packed, you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals, hipsters (who probably read about Difara's in the Village Voice's Best of NY) and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of Difara's.  People will get up ten times or more during their wait and nervously pace the floor by the counter, as if after 40 years in the business, the old man is finally going to fuck up and it's going to be THEIR order.  The old man is so calm, though, it's almost scary.  If I had to run a booming mom & pop business like that, with minimal help, I'd be a nervous wreck.  But if one TRULY wants to measure the greatness of a Difara slice, first, head over to one of Avenue J's countless kosher pizza joints.  Try one of THEIR slices, and then grab one at Difara's.  The choice is clear:  The Jews may be God's chosen people, but Difara's is God's chosen pizza.",12/31/2005,144,56,21,PfwqafGkOL9l27c49WGi_A
2950,Nichan S.,0.0,5,"I debated the fifth star due to the wait but I'll give Dom and his son kudos as this was like watching a finely tuned machine that puts out one of the best damn pies I've ever had. We arrived on a Sat. around 3 p.m. and while there was a number of people inside it was not jammed packed and fortunately there was no line out the door. Everyone inside was friendly and patient. I've read that if this is your first time to stick with the cheese which I would have been happy with but we opted for the round with sun dried tomato and garlic and could not have been happier. The flavors of the garlic, sun dried tomato, sauce, cheese and basil all mixing together creating a crescendo of flavor that made our taste buds dance with delight. We loved the crust and could not believe it could be so thin yet hold the toppings. We watched Dom create his masterpieces until ours came out just under an hour after arriving. We had it boxed to go and waited about 15 minutes before digging in and going to that happy place. Is it expensive (Christ, it's pizza) YES. Is it worth it, YES, YES, YES because of the quality of the fresh ingredients and the flavor. Would I go every week. NO. But a few times a year absolutely.

After an hour long ride on the subway, I wasn't thrilled to wait in line, but WTH- it put us in line first. Ah, yes- line. People queue for this pizza. We waited until 640p, watching the two younger people run around, and the older legend work his dough. When they let us in, it was mere moments until we were served two beautiful slices of oily, basil-decorated cheese pizza. There were different types of cheeses used, and you could tell. You could discern the salty sauce, the perfect oil... Each ingredient stood on its own. A few minutes later, we had another slice- I ordered mine with garlic and onions. There was SO. MUCH. GARLIC. And it was beautifully browned, slightly sweet, and dispersed perfectly. The onions were sliced thinly and in manageably short pieces, so I never got a long, stringy one that caused any sort of mess. This pizza was simply exquisite, and well worth the wait. Pay no mind to the naysayers, who probably insist this pizza isn't amazing because they could hardly be bothered to do what everyone else is doing. My advice?

2960,Chris P.,0.0,3,"Let it be known.  I LOVE DiFara's Pepperoni Pizza!  It as good, if not better, than any other pepperoni pizza I've had (and that includes Frank Pepe's, Sally's, Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Any Chicago Deep Dish Incarnation, etc.)  The Pepperoni is meaty, thickly sliced and simply delectable. The crust is like no other, with different textural give and crunch than any I've experienced.  The sauce is delectable.  And, the cheese is worthy of the highest praise (especially when you get your mitts on a paper plate-full of shredded goodness for additional application).The Square Pie is also VERY GOOD, yet inconsistent (overly charred the second time I ordered it) but delicious, nonetheless.  As a whole the pizzas can be tad oily, especially meat versions, but that is not really detractor for me (it just limits the overall amount I can scarf down).So, how can I only give 3 stars?  It's ridiculous, right?  Maybe.  But let's count the reasons, shall we?:1. The Definition of Inefficiency: This is, without a doubt, the worst run business, EVER:  - Order Taking and Delivery: Devoid of any logic.  And, on two seperate visits, late-comers got their pies, prior.  Not a huge deal if it didn't happen 4 and 6 times on those visits.- Slice Scavengers: for a man overwhelmed with demand, the fulfillment of the $4 slice should come to an end.  Inevitably, those customers always get there pie orders completed quicker.  Coincidence?- Counter Help: a term use very loosely, as these might be dimmest individuals ever to stand erect.- Workflow: Items utilized to construct these pizzas seem to be strewn all over the place (cheese in three different locales, dough kept in the back, toppings never on hand, et al). - Lastly, chefs should not be ringing up orders.  EVER.To conclude, I envy those individuals who able to visit and obtain their orders within 1 and 1/2 hours.2. This is also, without a doubt, one of filthiest food purveyors I've ever paid a return visit:- The walls are, literally, dripping with muck.  - The pictures have dead bugs affixed.- The tables are NEVER wiped down during service.- The condiments are hastily provided.  And, on several occassions, I've witness people use their hands to extract hot peppers (witnessed by the owner, without a word muttered).  Frikkin' nasty!- The slats open to the kitchen are adorned with inch-thick dust.- The wood floor, on which the pies are crafted, is utterly disgusting.- The counter utilized to sliced the pies are up front where customers cough, sneeze, spittle all over them.- As noted, previously, the same person who makes the pies handles the money (some of the most disgusting material EVER, mind you).- And, without fail, the beverage fridge will have multiple exploded containers held within.- But, if you don't believe me...go to the Board of Health and Read Up on their reviews of DiFara's.  Two words: Rodent Droppings.   Now, excuse me as I will, now, vomit.  I should have read up on this place earlier.To conclude: I want some penicillin.3. Clientele: Sorry, but some of most abrasive, obnoxious, loud and rude people I've ever encountered, have been at this establishment.  But, for further atmosphere, you also have to fend off the routine visits of pan-handlers who come and go throughout the ""restaurant"", sometimes idling up right next to you while you eat.To conclude: Not a shining endorsement for Brooklynites.Now, I know there are those who can overlook such things; I am just not one of those people.  Nothing is worth re-enduring the wait, the patrons, nor the grime of this establishment.  I've done it several times as I am foodie and pizza fanatic, but life is too short for such nonsense.  And, as good as the pizza is, it isn't that much better than other places; and other places have other pizza items that are superior (see: Frank Pepe's Clam Pie, for example).  Final Conclusion: Goodbye DiFara's.  And, best wishes.",6/2/2008,1,59,5,bhlaUJl-0iEeZ5BPDn0fzw

This is the best pizza I've ever had and I can personally say that I have lived in NY all my life but more importantly I have tried almost every major pizza parlor in all five boroughs as well as jersey and the island. I am always hesitant to say that anything is the best but I have not ever had better pizza. I can tell you this the neighborhood is hard to park in, subway is difficult to get to, the wait is usually an hour on the weekends, the place is small and dirty, the pizza is very expensive.

2971,Jenny S.,0.0,5,"i feel bittersweet about this significant event in my life. and i'll tell you why. i have been on a quest to find the best pizza in the world. although i thought nothing could beat mamma lucia's (see my review), i decided there must be better pizza out there. i just had a feeling. so i began my quest, and it ended much earlier than i anticipated. i journeyed far and wide to the heart of brooklyn and that's where the holy grail of pizza was hidden. so, i am a little sad that the quest is over, though i will still wholeheartedly try pizza that someone claims to be the best in the world. let me know. for being such a yelp virgin, am i giving 5-star ratings too frivilously? ah, well, i don't care. this place deserves it. i made the trek from the upper east side to avenue j to taste this pizza after having a less-than-amazing experience with grimaldi's. after reading what other yelpers had to say about di fara's, i was magnetized onto the Q line. getting a pizza at di fara's is quite an experience for a pizza enthusiast. nobody seems to care about the long line of people because they are so mesmerized by dom demarco and his delicate pizza crafting abilities. i'll summarize my experience here. i got to di fara's around 8pm on a sunday night. the Q line wasn't running to avenue J that night for some reason, so I had to get out early and take a cab there. fortunately, because the Q line stop wasn't running, there were significantly less people there than i expected. i guess not everyone is as hardcore as me in their pursuit of the best pizza in the world... so i get there, and there's probably about 10-15 people in line. and when i say line, i mean a big group around the counter. everyone is silent and staring intently at the adorable man behind the counter, who is putting toppings on pizzas like he was in a science lab - perfect portions and exact amounts of each topping. i am still in awe that for each pizza he takes a new ball of fresh mozzerella, still in the bag, drains it, and then crumbles it by hand over the pizza. he grates another type of cheese over the pizza as well, and cuts the basil with scissors. he pauses a few times to drizzle olive oil over the pizza. and this happens with EVERY pizza, so you bet your ass you'll be waiting in line for awhile. but, as other yelpers have yelped, it is SO worth it. i would stand there for hours to watch this guy make pizzas. its just incredible. if only this pizza weren't so far away...but i think that's part of what makes me covet it so much, i have to WORK for it. ok, so i know its ""gross"" to eat food in the subway and all that, but when i got my pizza there was no way in hell i was waiting an hour to get back up to my apartment. i sat down on the concrete in the subway station and opened up my delicious pizza and took my first bite right there. and that's when my life changed. i knew i had tasted the best pizza in the world. what do you do when you realize all your dreams have come true??",10/10/2007,26,77,1,NF3z2NCheAOzRpSmK9SJDw

I had the honor and pleasure of watching Dom for over two hours craft every pie as if it was the only pie that he was making today. This was actually like sitting first row watching the ""Michael Jordan "" of pizza's give an all star performance.  Dom takes such pride in making sure that every ingredient is the freshest and best. He himself makes the pizza from start to finish. No one helps him. How he stands there for 10 hours everyday creating one masterpiece after another is truly a sight to see. He removes the scalding hot pizza's from the oven with his bare hands. I have never seen this done before. His forty plus years of making pies have left his hands numb to the heat.Everyone should experience this once in their life. This man truly loves what he does and takes such great pride in producing the best. We should all take a lesson from this icon in terms of taking pride in what we do.

However there were only 3 people working, 5 tables, maybe about 13 chairs and 50 people crammed into the tiny place. The only reason the line moved quickly was because a lady takes down the orders in a notebook. After about an hour we managed to get a table. After another hour we finally got our pizza.

But the pizza just didn't work for me.  The sum wasn't greater than its parts. The slices are smallish. The sauce and cheese slid right off onto the plate. And each slice cost $5.00!! ($30 per pie). This is the most expensive pizza that I've ever had. Not to mention, the place is a dirty dump. After Di Fara's I drove straight to L&B for a real slice (only $2.25) to chase down Di Fara's lest I return home to Long Island completely disappointed. Many may like Di Fara's. I just don't see it. Personally, I'd rather have pizza at Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Lombardi's or L&B Spumoni Gardens.",3/19/2010,0,21,0,Pz8CuR3wPstFtQ9XAw6GSg

3010,Orit S.,0.0,5,"a great stop over if youre in brooklyn. the place is minimal. but the pizza and the people make up for it. the pizza is always just coming out of the oven, since there's such a huge turnover with so many people ordering. one way to guarantee you get your slice faster then some, ask for a topping, dominic puts it on a slice while the pie's still baking, so when it comes out you don't have to wonder if you'll be the lucky few who'll get a slice or have to wait for a new pie. the best topping is extra cheese, fresh mozzarella pieces put right on the slice.",9/21/2008,16,26,0,cxSiZA6zoS2vnuEyDngxuQ

3012,Ason U.,0.0,5,"It's amazing how crowded this place gets.  My cousins live near Di Fara, so growing up, I spent a lot of weekends in Midwood and would often eat here, leaving me with nothing but fond memories of the pizza and Dom, who was always kind to the neighborhood kids running through his little shop waiting for pizza.  I went back a few weeks ago and was surprised by how long the line gets now.  The line is a testament to how great the pizza is, and I'm glad to see Dom still going strong.  I just wish I could go back to my youth where I didn't have to wait so long for some pizza!",5/5/2009,0,6,0,ekuGr4hV4JXfP08SBG_RZw
3013,Baby S.,0.0,5,"I stumbled upon this place incidentally on the way to a doctor's office that was a block away.  It was about 8 years ago when the slice cost 2.50 at Dom's and 1.50 anywhere so my first reaction was-what is this dingy overpriced place?  But, I was so hungry that I said, whatever, I just need to eat something.  Little did I know that I have stepped into the legendary Di Fara land but upon taking the first bite I realized that this was something unusual and when I saw people walking in and the place getting crowded by the second, I knew this was something famous.  Of course, the next day I searched for the place on the Internet and this is how my love affair has started.  I usually try to call ahead and surprisingly, I have always gotten my order made on time.  Maybe it's the fact that when Dom picks up the phone, I always call him by his first name so although I am not a stead regular, it sounds that I am.  The pizza is absolutely delicious, thin crust, the perfect balance of sweetness of the sauce and the tanginess of the cheese.",12/2/2008,0,716,0,jarQAt1wP2CaYkrQKKOHRA
3014,peppermonkey z.,0.0,5,"Walking into Di Fara's was like walking into a little bubble encapsulating the whole city of New York. To my left is a Sicilian Harley biker with a heavy accent talking to a hedge fund manager from Westchester. To my right there are a group of ""youts"" from jersey city, the leader of which is barking orders to his minions to secure a table. There are families, there are babies, there is the moody daughter who is turns from sweet to malicious in seconds, and then there is dom, oblivious to all the havoc and theatrics, making his pies one by one, dough-sauce-mozzarella-olive oil-bake-olive oil under-basil from both ends-olive oil over-cheese then repeat. A routine he's been doing for years and years. After waiting for an hour or so we get a slice. With eager anticipation, I grab the it with my hand, and its so hot, I almost drop the precious slice. (Dom must have some bionic fingers because he just pulls the pie right off the oven with his bare hands). When the slice has cooled off to reasonability, I take a bite...the heavens open up and I am transported to pizza nirvana. A blissful combination of ingredients and love. Unbelievable. If there's one bite of food I will be craving from all my meals in New York, it will be this.  We waited another hour and half for 2 more slices.",4/6/2009,6,13,0,VdHxfTNnG1JYNeD9xGj4ow
3015,Michael K.,0.0,5,"This has to be the best pizza experience in all of New York and not just because the pizza is the best in New York City, but because of the unique process that goes into making it.  The pizza here is perfect, with a nice crunchy, thin and sweet crust and a tomato sauce that has no equal.  It is some amazing stuff that the owner makes himself.  But we'll get to that in a minute.  The toppings are all mouth-watering and very fresh while the cheese is too good to be true, even if it looks a little different from your normal pizza.  But this is no ordinary pizza.  This is DiFara, where there is one guy making each and every pizza pie with the freshest ingredients possible, which he keeps in the back and are all imported from the motherland of italy.  The process is long and arduous but in the end, you don't care as the pizza is just too tasty to make you upset.  My dad and I finished a whole large plain pie.  He usually doesn't eat that much pizza, so I was really impressed with it.  Try to call beforehand and order fifteen to thirty minutes before getting there, because it takes the seventy-year-old owner that long to make the heavenly pies.  The reason why is as follows:  first, he kneads the dough and pours on the fresh tomato sauce made there.  Next, he adds the mozzarella cheese off of a fresh slab of mozzarella, which looks pretty cool, as it isn't shaved but cut into quite lage pieces all over the pizza.  Still covers the pizza very well and is all in all, a great way to do it.  Then it goes in the oven and he continues.  This is all without gloves and who cares about the health department because this place is just too good for them.  His Igor-like assistant brings him any ingredients or toppings that he needs from the back and this goes on all day.  When done, the pizza comes out with the cheese still bubbling and this is where it gets too good.  He sprinkles fresh parmeasan cheese on the pie and then adds fresh basil by actually taking the plant and cutting it over the pie with a pair of scissors.  Hey, he could be doing it with his hands, so the scissor is fine by me. Now, you wait for the pizza to cool and then, pizza bliss as you bite into it.  This pizza really lived up to the hype and was a fantastic meal to leave new york for college.  Last great taste of New York before heading down South.  The place is a hole-in-the-wall type pizza parlor but it just can't be beat.  Parking meters are around and the subway train is right by the pizza place, so getting there ain't the problem.  It's the wait that upsets some, but just have some patience and you'll be feasting on what is the best pizza in new york and you'll have a great story for your pals.",9/19/2007,2,95,0,NLJsbmqnOiBP18zvrDJrVg
3016,D W.,0.0,4,"it's good. it's really freakin good. but damn, that old man needs to let someone else help him make the pizza. we waited about 1.5 hours for a pizza. he also needs to stop selling pizza by the slices when he has about 100 people waiting for whole pies.",7/28/2009,0,56,0,u2nrSZY323I_UM-sylwBQw
3017,Dorastella e.,0.0,1,"I drove until Midwood as I was told that it was the best place of NY. I was ready to wait, I was in a good mood. When they told me it would take 1 hour to 1,5 hours to get a full pizza I said OK. After 1hour they told me it will only take 30 min if I wanted slices, otherwise it would be an extra hour for a whole pizza. I said OK for the slices (16$ for 4 slices!!!). 30 min later the slices were not ready, they said it would take an extra 30 min for the slices, or 45 min for the pizza. They pissed me off: honestly, am I ready to wait for 2 hours to have a slice of pizza? this is ridiculous. If I want a proper Napolitan pizza, I'd better take the first plane to Sorrento. At least I will sit in a proper restaurant while I wait, instead of standing like an animal, ready to jump at each other's throat for a slice of pizza. They say the wait makes it better. In my case I passed that stage: I wasn't hungry anymore so I left after 90 min of waiting, without any pizza not slice.",3/27/2009,0,3,0,IqA4Oirgyqp_-VDb15Rhbw
3018,Ben C.,0.0,5,"Like every other Brooklynite, I'm very particular about my pizza and Di Fara does not disappoint--it actually exceeded my expectations (since I've gotten mixed reviews from friends)..I thought I reached pizza heaven when I ate at L&B's and Lombardi's and this places tops them both in taste and quality of pizza (although the above mentioned pizza places are still among the best I've ever had) yes this place is seedy/greasy looking and has no seats and you smell like ""kitchen"" after you walk about but it is truely worth it to see the master Dom at work..the pies come out bubbling as he sprinkles cheese, cuts fresh basil leaves, and drizzles berio olive oil all over it..truely a masterpiece..my friends who made the trip from LI wanted to take some home but concluded that it'd get soggy and they would probably scarf it down before they got on the highway anyhow. The only criticism I have of the pizza is that one of our pies were burnt on one side but that won't stop me from coming back and bringing hungry friends with me.",5/28/2009,0,156,0,-ipe4RBLU62yo_jHhEVttg
