0,Travis H.,1,5,"Not the biggest pizza fan at all but i can appreciate a good slice and a historical restaurant.My wife's half brother took me for a ride to his neighborhood in Brooklyn and we ended up in Bensonhurst! We pull up to this 80 year old pizza joint that is jumping and i mean literally jumping! There were so many people here i thought they were giving the food away for free. There were about two long lines outside for takeout and two windows to speed things up but man all this chaos for pizza? It must he damn good because i can count clearly over one hundred people just eating outside on the patio  we finally get to the window and my bruh orders a entire pie while I'm looking inside the kitchen and it's a sight to be seen. Pizza ovens EVERYWHERE buys covered in flour guys speaking with their hands as Italians do lol and I'm just amazed at this experience. We get the pizza and find a spot in the crowded patio, Frank opens the box and BAM!! This pizza is definitely looking different lol the sauce is on top of the cheese and it's a square not a circle. Oh well i dig in and man this was very dope the pizza was light and fluffy the crust was delicious and all i could think is my wife is going to be jealous when she hears about this spot!While we're feeding our faces Frank gives me a deep history lesson on this place which allegedly has mob ties. There were some disputes over the original recipe and a couple heads had to roll in the end smh crazy things i won't mention in this review so when you see me in person I'll fill you in Great spot for pregame great spot to meet up with the family and enjoy this historical gem in Brooklyn.",7/23/2019,301,280,431,fFWYi59ABi4Zjitm5XxW7g
1,Eric R.,0,5,"Don't tell anyone in Queens, but L&B is my favorite pizza place in New York.I've never actually had their spumoni which is ironic, but their pizza is incredible. Old school feel, old school location, and great service. It's not your typical slice, but once you have a taste you'll be dying to go back",7/22/2019,0,3,0,-1El6T50HEAfPr7xwbVPgQ

3,Kevin K.,1,3,"There are a few memories of me growing up as a New York City boy - one of them involves coming home from school to an empty house (mom is working overtime at the local sweatshops and dad is slaving away at the local Cantonese seafood restaurant 6 days a week), and microwaving myself a mediocre after-school snack...usually Ellio's frozen bread pizza.  The joy of munching on that while doing homework, and faced with the constant threat of being publicly shamed at extended family gatherings for doing badly in school and being beaten to within an inch of my life with the bamboo feather duster (oddly enough never used for its intended purpose of dusting) if the schoolwork is not done.  Well, let's just say it left a few marks on my psyche - my grades were decent until I get to high school,  I scoff at the value of corporal punishment, and I hate bread pizza to this day.Why bring up Ellio's microwavable frozen pizzas?  Ellio's pizza is a ""thing"" if you grew up in NYC metro, much like the student transit passes (with holographic prints) or Mexican dudes selling gum for a quarter or 50 cents on the 4 train.  They are bread pizzas sold at the frozen aisles, 3 planks of bread topped with industrial red tomato goo, and something that is in theory cheese-like, but found in minute amounts that peels off thinly.  Sure it looks like pizza, but it's a vastly inferior facsimile that our parents bought to save money and brain cells.  And the Sicilian grandma slice at L&B?  It feels like what happened if the Ellio's frozen bread pizza grew up.  The crust is bread-like with yeasty notes.  The sauce have some tartness and fresh tomato flavor notes, but it doesn't seem to work with the bread-y crust.  The cheese?  Barely there, and it's not your usual fold-up with the orange oil dripping down your chin.  Decent, but reminds me of Chicago style deep dish, and I am not a fan of that style.  I need to finish up Mr. Greenberg's math problems before my mom shows up at 6p...and then I realize my wife needs a top-up on her drink.  Involuntary memory recall is a crazy thing.  The grandma slice was but a small part of the meal.  The seafood salad was...decent.  Not superb, not mediocre.  Good amount of calamari, shrimps and mussels, dressed with red peppers and greens throughput.  The raviolis were...okay.  The meatballs (two) were inexplicably large, but oddly devoid of texture or flavor - nothing extra remarkable as it's your Sunday gravy dinner situation here.  If it's your homeboy Vinnie's house and you are an invited guest of his family, you compliment the cooking and drink to Nonna's health, but when you are in a restaurant, you can only scoff slightly - the food is solid but nothing to rant about, the service is slightly surly but adequate/acceptable.  The interior is your usual Italian American red sauce joint - think Bucca Di Beppo but toned back a tad.  I think it's just fine.  Of course, the question is...how is their namesake frozen desserts?  It's probably the only good reason to come in.  The Vanilla Cremolata is probably the best of the flavors.  The pastachio is decent.  The chocolate was okay.  If you are habitually indecisive you can have all 3 in the rainbow.  If you are walking down the streets of Bensonhurst on a 90 degree day nothing else will hit the spot.  Just do me a favor?  Stay away from their Italian ices.  Their lemon ice is terrible.  Not sweet, not tart and not much lemon flavors - as a Queens boy from Corona I grew up on Benfaremos, which is one of the best in the city.  Just stick to their namesake Spumonis.  Eh, I don't regret coming in for Raviolis and Spumoni, but yeah, don't be too enticed by the hype surrounding their pies.  If you are a New Yorker you know where to go for a cheap slice of foldables already.",7/18/2019,83,274,3074,EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw
4,Elizabeth D.,1,4,"Love this spot. It's a classic in Brooklyn serving some really good pizza. The thing is, I'm not a fan of Sicilian slices. I'm 100% a thin crust kinda girl. I got the whole pie to go ($24) but managed to scarf down a slice on the drive home and it tasted just like a regular Sicilian slice. The next day I heated up the left overs in the oven, and I immediately wished I bought another pie because it was delicious. I absolutely loved it the day after and I'm not sure why. Before I left, I also tried a large Spumoni ice cream ($3.75) which was pistachio, vanilla and chocolate ice cream swirled all together. It was soooooo good. You could actually taste bits and pieces of pistachios in it, so it was so good! I'd definitely come back here for sure just for the ice cream! There is ample parking because of the adjacent parking lot (which was so nice that I didn't have to find parking!) also they accept credit card. Oh and also, there's tons of indoor and outdoor covered seating and I was able to bring my little dog to enjoy the sunshine too!",6/19/2019,214,285,445,FmUYpn0t7E0nCG3tD0NnBA
5,Mary S.,1,4,"We got a slice of the round pie and a 1/2 square pie plus a side of meatballs. I preferred the round slice while my husband preferred the Sicilian slice. 4 stars are because this is an institution and a Brooklyn staple but I've had better Sicilian pizza elsewhere. The round pie was pretty good and the prices are very fair. I use the meatballs as a litmus test for any Italian/pizza place I go to and these were far above average. You could tell they used a meat blend and it was not at all too bread-y. I really enjoyed visiting this place, it truly is a must-go if you're in the area because of the history. My grandmother makes her pIzza like that, the old school way. One interesting fact is that they use cheese slices as opposed to grated cheese. Final verdict is I would come again for the meatballs and round pie but I'll get my Sicilian elsewhere. Also the Spumoni ice cream was really more of milky Italian ice, which I didn't care for.",6/24/2019,6,63,46,LBqp_81fVP4tyll7TTPP0w
6,Roscoe C.,0,3,"Not really a fan. Pricey for just a regular plain pizza + $$ for a few sprinkles of sausageThe dough was raised to perfection and baked to the perfect level of crispiness on the edges, although it was so thick, you can pretty much be full with just 2 square slices. There's a reason the pics for the pizza is looks like its all crust and really red.80% dough, 20% sauce, a light sprinkle of cheese.",7/20/2019,145,13,16,zTrabBFoxrEudlXlRov0jA
7,Ryan R.,1,5,"What more is there to say?Went here after a long bike ride out to the area and ordered a square slice and a small spumoni ice cream.The square slice was excellent--definitely one of the best pieces of pizza I have had in New York--and pretty cheap at $3.The spumoni was also great and was also quite large for the price.Overall, this place has been around for a long time--and for good reason--definitely worth checking out if you find yourself anywhere near the area.",6/16/2019,758,1894,273,rLCbMQmIuWnlI-IhIj51kQ
8,Jeff K.,1,5,"I was in the area and I remember seeing this place on Yelp and I was impressed with the sheer number of reviews. I figured I had to give it a try.I ordered three slices of Sicilian. I was so curious about what ""the best Sicilian slice I've ever had,"" would taste like. Luckily I got three slices from a pie that had just came out of the oven. As I started in on the first slice, I tasted a mild and smooth flavor. I didn't want to put anything on these slices, at first. (I usually throw a bit of garlic salt on my pizzas) After a few bites, I tasted a mild fresh tomato flavor and a subtle cheese. The slice was very good. I'm not so much a Sicilian pizza person, so I can't really say that this is the best slice of Sicilian pizza, but I can say that this was one of the best slices of Sicilian pizza I've ever had.",5/31/2019,570,297,1430,0ZRTwd5xyGwo4cW1vgQJNg
9,Syd R.,1,5,"The best of the best. Literally you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Its worth the trek to deep Brooklyn from NYC. Expect a wait and crowd most of the time. There's an option to order at the counter and sit outside at the outdoor tables or sit in their dining room for the full menu experience. All of their pasta & seafood dishes look unreal whenever we see a waiter bringing something to someone's table. But, what you absolutely must get, is their famous Sicilian pie. It is SO.GOOD. We always order a pie and bring the rest home. Last visit, we also got the baked clams (amazing, some of the best I've had in a while) and house salad (simple but so good... their dressing is great). Their spumoni ice cream is super refreshing and a must each time IMO!Our waiter, Matt C, was super nice and friendly and made great suggestions. Nothing better than great staff!",6/19/2019,293,106,337,SziKmSU5nW1TYnQE1s-zGA
10,Keyawnia R.,1,2,"I could've had a V8... *shrug shoulders* and I hate tomato juice.This pizza was beyond over sold to me. The absolute silver living was the crust was cooked perfectly. I love a nice doughy crust in the center, but crusty crunchy hard bottom and edges to hold all the cheese and sauce.  I for #2 did not enjoy the sauce. The sauce lacked any depth or any other flavors besides tomato. It was acidic, pungent, and bland. I would  rather licked the thorns of a rose bush than to ingest that sauce again.Another upside was the delicious cherry Italian ice. This it a classic for me that you cant go wrong with. A beautiful red, silky cherry Italian Ice on a July day is the remedy for anything that will bothers you.",7/14/2019,265,73,142,t0g1EV_Jwr4LD6pX5CfVDg
11,Matthew Z.,0,4,"Can you ever really beat classic Brooklyn?I went yesterday with my fiance and in laws to celebrate a few birthdays and even though the wait for a party of 9 in the heat was a bit long late on a Sunday night, it sure was worth it.Collectively we ordered a bunch of items to share including mozzarella sticks, arianchini, fried zucchini, some salads, pasta, and of course the Sicilian pizza. While all the food was pretty good ( surprise shoutout to the arianchini), by far the best thing we had was that pizza.Cut as a sicilian pie as opposed to the more traditional round version, the pizza has the perfect combination of sweet tomato sauce, a hint of cheese, and dough which is fluffy enough when you bite into it but stands up strong against this saucy mama. Honestly, if this is what Chicagoans claimed as deep dish pizza I would be fine eating it. But until they do, its traditional NY slices and Sicilians for me.Even though you might be stuffed from your dinner, save a little room for the spumoni on the way out; your sweet tooth will thank you later.",7/15/2019,47,71,22,hyzAtIyotWarGiJWxA89BQ
12,Karina S.,1,5,"This place is just the best and can't compare to any other NYC pizza joint. Although on the expensive side, every once in a while it's nice to indulge in a square slice and some spumoni (they have a variety of flavors, my favorite being the creamsicle and spumoni!). Their pizza is amazing. This place gets crowded on summer nights but honestly there's plenty of outdoor seating, so there's always somewhere to sit... or stand. Definitely recommend!",7/5/2019,106,80,439,_IlvA43dH3K2vG4hmYf8NA
13,Jill G.,1,5,Made a stop here because I am a huge fan of Sicilian pizza and this place did not disappoint. The slice is perfect and the sauce is very tasty.

14,Julie Ying X.,1,5,"A really great pizza place in Brooklyn, too bad it's so far from where I live.  However, if it's closer, I would gain 20 pounds so probably best that it's far.  I really like coming here in the summer on the weekends.  You can order from the window and eat in the large outdoor seating area.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 people.  We ordered the square slices ($3 each) and large cups of rainbow spumoni ice cream ($3.75).  Their square slice was thick, great crispy crust, and tangy tomato sauce.  The rainbow (vanilla, chocolate, pistachio) spumoni ice cream was smooth, creamy, and full of pistachios.  You might as well get the large since it's only a 50 cent difference and it's much larger.  I would come back next summer, definitely a Brooklyn summer tradition.",7/7/2019,241,620,621,52R1k6G03m8ES7N1rXiB1Q
15,Zayn S.,1,5,"This spot is nice. Right in Brooklyn, GREAT pizza. They even have a little spot for beer and wings and fries.I think it's a great cheap family spot to visit, sit outside and enjoy some good New York pizza.

16,Katherine B.,1,5,"Came here after an event in Brooklyn to try the infamous Sicilian slice. It was heaven! I was a little thrown off at first with the cheese being under the sauce but it was so good. I also had to try the Ice Cream that I heard great things about as well. I didn't want anything heavy so I got the Vanilla Chip Ice, not exaggerating but it was definitely the best Ice I've had.

17,Steve S.,1,5,"This is my favorite pizza place I have ever been too.  Ever since I saw this establishment on man vs food, I wanted to try it. With all the positive reviews and ratings,  I knew it was going to be amazing.  And I was right.  I have ate here about 3 or 4 times now, and everytime the pizza was fresh and delicious.   I always order the squared pie (Sicilian), as you can never go wrong with that. To me, that us the best type of pizza they make.  There is always a long line to order, which I dont mind, and that shows just how damn popular this place really is.  When in Brooklyn,  especially the Coney Island area, you must try the pizza here. You won't regret it!!!",6/9/2019,133,125,534,ZQglJsk6SvEGF06Jq62YIA

I took the last spot available. Lucky me! Anyway, I ordered the mixed spumoni and it was so creamy. It was extremely tasty and worth the money. The line was long but so worth it.

19,Sho R.,1,5,"The square slice is the best thing here. A thick slice of pizza topped with cheese and marinara. I added some pepper flakes also. It was one of the best pizzas I ever had. This is the first time in my life I am eating pizza with no added toppings. Generally I add 5 or more toppings to my pizza. Even without any toppings this is the best. The spumoni also tasted really good. This place has a lot of outdoor seating. If you just take food from the outside counter and eat in the outdoor seats, it will be very quick.",6/1/2019,50,508,2321,Pntr3Eo9j0kiV0n9ZxmL8Q
20,Alfie B.,0,4,I love this place which is weird for me to say as I am picky about the Italian food that I eat as well as pizza. Now I am a HUGE fan of extra cheese on my pizza. That being said they are not known for there cheese. Seeing this at first glance I was not impressed. I was told to have a square and you'll see. So I did. Now I am a huge fan of corner squares. So I got a pie with some friends and got my parmesan cheese covered the slices and dug in. I was very pleasantly surprised when I loved it. I highly recommend this spot for anyone who loves a good pizza. I don't have much experience with their food but what I had was good.This place is a true Brooklyn landmark. I will go there any day of the week.,7/16/2019,31,20,0,XQL3teFtKe9rDxlFj5AyOw
21,T. C.,0,5,"5 stars for the Sicilian pizza!  The sicilian slice has sauce that tastes like fresh tomatoes, not too much cheese, and the perfect crust/crumb. I would definitely want to visit this place again. I wasn't crazy about the NY style pizza, though. It wasn't bad by any means, but I've had better elsewhere, such as Scarr's, where the sauce has a much more intense flavor.  But here is where the Sicilian slice shines. The line went by very quickly, and the restaurant takes credit or cash.",5/26/2019,19,92,165,7aHvx4kTH92t5q4P0qTcAw
22,Kyle C.,1,4,Been going here since a kid and I went back and the taste was like a trip down memory lane. The only thing taking the 5th star away is kind of avoidable due to the high traffic of customers. You can tell the pizza has been sitting on a rack for a while before it is thrown in the oven. However the circle pie was good but the square is the way to go. Perfect charred crust and that tangy sauce is always going to hit home!!!,5/23/2019,2,162,291,K6mz_v2RDQ7hiX2uQZOKWQ
23,Lauren S.,0,5,"I love this pizza!! Give me a corner and call it a day ! Some people think it's sweet, others think it's too much sauce but their squares are awesome. Good solid slice of pizza. You definitely should try it and see what the hypes about .",7/12/2019,7,7,0,qrO8m-4yK9EOGvxWiMeCSw

25,Scott G.,0,3,"This review is based solely on the pizza which you can order to-go (or enjoy on their huge outdoor and covered patio). Their grandma slice squares ($3 each) are thick, crunchy, and a a tad sweet. Overall, pretty standard peetza. I'm not entirely sure why there is so much hype surrounding this place; perhaps it's due to their rich history in BK. Anyways, swing by for a slice if you're in the area. I don't believe it is worth a long trek, though.",6/9/2018Previous review,38,473,10,Z2PISdtGHThSUUbFccGkrA
26,June C.,1,5,Very cheap price $3 for a slice of square pizza. It has very rich red tomato sauce and rich cheese between the bread. The bread is thick but very soft unlike the thin pizza you usually get in Manhattan. They have different lines for a slice of pizza or a pie or ice cream. You can choose if you want your slice on the side of pie which has a crunch or center of the pie. It's almost one hour away by D train subway from Manhattan. I like their ice cream more than the pizza. They have a rainbow flavor which contains three colors. Their ice cream is not very sweet. It tastes like ice and it won't make you feel very thirsty after. They have indoor seating and outdoor too.,7/2/2019,99,143,125,P6uFkYDb71W9GU1Ici7VGw

28,Adam P.,0,2,"I ordered a Sicilian Pie with pepperoni and Rice Balls for a total of $39. Based on the hype surrounding this place, I must say that I was very disappointed. It wasn't atrocious, but at the same time my first experience wasn't that great. I can't say that I'll be coming back. Sicilian Pizza: major disappointment. The sauce was very good, but the dough/crust was hardened like a rock and there was virtually no cheese on it. The topping portions and placement were done right though, as each bite had pepperoni.  Rice Balls: very good, but for the $9 that I was charged, I don't think I would order it again. The portions of rice balls I received for $9 was far overpriced.",7/15/2019,31,15,5,FhBDIayXJLFGkiRrFtlxAw

I'm rarely in the area now but always happy to get a pie or two.In the summers, the outside area is enjoyable, with a homey feel.PS: The spumoni is really good and gets short shrift.

30,Shirin P.,1,4,Totally worth the 1 hour train ride from Manhattan. Get the square pizza. The regular cheese pie is nothing special but the square is something else.

31,Tiffany O.,1,5,"Nothing bad to every say about Spumoni Gardens. Food is always incredible, fantastic service and rarely ever a long wait. I have ate in dining room, outside and take out. No matter what option you choose the food is ALWAYS fresh. I recommend their classic square slice over the round pie. For dining room options I recommend everything there hasn't been a dish I didn't like. But I will say my favorites. Boston Bibb salad, roasted artichokes, Baked clams (on my top 5 list), rigatoni with vodka sauce, angus steak and chicken francese. I also suggest doing the chefs table you get appetizers, salad, pastas, entrees and dessert and they do it family style. Whether you're a party of 4 or 8 they'll cater it to enough food and no one will go hungry. Can't wait for my next visit to L & B Spumoni Gardens!",5/10/2019,37,92,166,DLwt9F5KGWdxb6iZLrVKww
32,Brandon C.,0,5,"Great pizza, not the top three, but of course worth five stars! It's all in the dough!!I will cut to the chase the pizza is a Sicilian style (their signature) so it's a tomato pie(mainly sauce). The sauce itself is better than average with a small amount of spice to it mixed with that sweet marinara flavor is delicious. However....the dough is what makes this pizza. When you bite into it, IT NEEDS TO BE FRESH, the dough almost deflates in your mouth, like you pop a balloon and all the flavor slowly seeps out of the slices pores into your mouth. Most pizza is either too thin, and Sicilian  style pies are usually reliant on the dough, others have fallen short with flavor where the cheese or tomato flavor masks the doughs flavor as well as others have a harder texture. But Spumoni pizza dough has such a sweet taste to it like fresh buttered bread rolls that deflate in your mouth and make them so distinguished yet so entwined  with the remaining ingredients, although not my favorite all around pizza I've had, it's my favorite all time Sicilian I had though.The other dishes were good, calamari lacked a little bit of flavor and the calamari was a tad rubbery. The baked clams were surprisingly really good they kept that jersey shore style clam feel to them where they looked like they were just plucked from the ground haha but they had great juice added on and delicious Italian style bread crumb.",1/6/2019,153,26,64,99q0m9dcGhwq-ywcIMYr_Q
33,Jose C.,1,5,"Update: just wanted to add that I came back and finally ordered a full pizza this time with pepperoni. For some reason, it tasted better last time I was in, without the pepperoni. It was still very tasty, but next time I come, in just gonna stick to a slice or two. When I think New York style pizza, I think large round big slices that you fold in half. Who ever knew that one of the best pizzas I've ever tried would be cut into a square. Yes Detroit's style is also Sicilian style square cut, and here at home in Chicago we cut our thin crust into squares, the slice from here was truly amazing. I walked into the wrong place at first to find out I didn't see any slices available on the menu. I walked back outside and into the ""pizzeria"" and you ask for your slice right in the front. Unfortunately, I only wanted to get a slice since I was trying to order slices from other areas. Now that I know how delicious these slices are, I won't be leaving this place without an entire pizza. The square itself was thick cheese and sauce on top. The sauce is what makes this pizza so delicious without a doubt. Not too sweet, not too thick, not too saucy. Just simply perfect. I also consider myself a very meaty guy. And prefer sausage on my pizza. Pepperoni would also do. But this slice of pizza does not require meat to enhance any flavors. The slices only come with sauce and cheese, if you want other ingredients you would have to purchase a full pizza. Im a very bias type of person and support all my local places and have always thought that nothing could touch Chicago style pizza. Spumonis is very close to rivaling what we have here in chicagNo folding the pizza here. Just take a bite and enjoy the deliciousness. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be coming back here.",6/22/2019,456,557,963,XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA

38,Meini C.,1,4,Known for their Sicilians slice (cheese first then sauce) and of course their other pizzas. I've grown up eating their pizza and love it. Definitely a credible pizza spot In Brooklyn. If you're ever in the neighborhood I definitely recommend coming here for the experience. Their ice cream is also delicious!,7/17/2019,348,152,528,439z_xJcbZ-sltAFieWh-Q
39,Vincent A.,1,4,"Went here with my sister on a Thursday night on the way to the airport. The first thing I have to say was that I was shocked (in a good way with how crowded it was). A lot of the restaurant is outdoor seating and it was raining when we went and there was still a great line. They have a great indoor seating area and then outside they have a huge tent for people when it is raining. The ordering process for outdoor seating was super easy. There were three different windows for what you could order. One window was for pizza, another for ice cream and a final for the rest of the hot foods they sold. My sister and I both got two slices of the square pie and one of the circle slices. We both agreed that not only was the square much better (I think it is what they are known for) it was one of the best square slices we have had in our entire life. The circle slice was average. Came out a little cold for us. They were not reheating slices because of how fast they were selling them, but I guess the normal was not selling as fast by the slice. We also got an order of fries and they were super good and I would highly recommend anyone to get them if they are a fan of fries. We ended our meal with an ice cream cone each. The ice cream was very good, the only problem I had with it was that the cone is not very good compared to the ice cream. They should really get some waffle cones instead of wafer. Wafer cones taste way to fake in my opinion. Overall, very good restaurant and very good experience.",6/29/2019,2,87,9,dKt1wNDtg-tsTE0GKygWqA

41,Lawrence C.,0,4,"So I came here one day on the recommendation of many friends for their sicilian / square pie. One having told me he'd occasionally make the drive from NJ just to grab a pie or two to bring home.Now I ordered a whole pie ahead of time for pickup with my family and had it in the car. Maybe it wasn't fresh out of the oven but fairly fresh. That being said I know my initial impression was huh? That's it? The flavors aren't anything that would stand to be impressive or remarkable in my opinion. However that being said, what is remarkable is the overall balance of flavor in such a way that you also don't get tired of eating it and stand to want more. Almost like a hidden addictive property where you just kinda want to crave more. The sauce and cheese as others have said are well balanced and the crust is incredibly crumbly with nice texture as you chew. Surprisingly still good as leftovers reheated in an oven as well!As I've said, somehow I kinda want more square slices and so will definitely be back. I see why they always draw a crowd.",6/12/2019,46,42,11,QJUq-qw80yCw8tZzgadKWw
42,Angela L.,0,5,"Best square slice. PERIOD.I've never tried a round slice from here, but the square slice is delicious.The unique thing about L&B square is they put the mozzarella cheese on top of the dough, followed by the sauce. Totally different from a traditional pizza, but GENIUS. The cheese melts into the dough and makes it so soft and pillowy. There is no cheese-pull with this sbut I am totally okay with this because the flavor and texture is the best ever.The sauce is truly the star here.Tangy with the perfect amount of sweetness and covered in a beautiful snowfall of fresh grated Parmesan *swoons*I will come back over and over again.They also have delicious spumoni! (Pistachio, vanilla and chocolate ice cream swirl)3/24/19I'm back to let you know the Creamsicle soft serve is incredible. That is all.",3/24/2019Updated review,3,22,39,_KsgIIZCvZW9Z44bWhWXhA

I ordered the cheesesteak and after one bite realized it was nothing more than heated up roast beef with cheese on it lol. My suspicions were confirmed once i moved the meat, you could see the gravy on the bread. Tastes ok, but call it what it is; that was no cheesesteak.  Bottom line, still a great pizza place.

The salads looked really good and the pasta dishes that l saw coming out were piled high but l prefer less of very good quality. Wait staff was excellent but food not to my liking or taste.

Sicilian slices come out a little doughey sometimes if they're not baked all the way through. If you don't like that, I'd recommend asking them to keep it in the oven for an extra 30 seconds or reheat when you get home.Pizza sauce is light, fragrant and a little sweet - seriously addicting!",7/2/2019,285,79,179,QRN-yAxnzXMa0zVH_k-6dg
48,Hal D.,1,4,"Great Sicilian slice and low prices, but the regular slice was very cold (despite the fact that we asked if it's warm). The Sicilian slice has a fluffy texture, beautifully tasting sauce and a really nice cheese component. They have a parking lot but keep in mind it's incredibly crowded on Saturday nights.

Ordered sicilian slices, two per person - which was perfect.Asked for a corner slice because usually I love those, but honestly - the center is where it's at here! I never thought I would say that about anything, but really - the sauce and that drizzle of whatever seasoning & cheese are just divine.Hop back on the line & get yourself a little rainbow spumoni which has excellent texture and taste, to cap off a perfect night!",9/9/2018Previous review,80,325,1725,RBQ2rtnMI93JuE8UyVBItg

If you still don't like the crust just let them know you would like the middle slices. If you don't tell them which slices you want they would give you a random slice.,7/18/2019,685,87,97,BvRUwN5QUWOdWaYLMEKY2g

From freshness to quality nothing compares I had sausage with peppers and onions and after I ate I didn't have a bloated feeling even had enough room for ice cream which is also made fresh at the facility The place is at times over populated but I must say I was impressed by the service and staff work together and quickly to get orders together for customers.

54,Cat D.,1,5,"Came here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn"" pizza tour.  This was one of the stops we made on this tour.  The first pizza place was Grimaldi's.  If one were to ask me, ""which pizza is better?"" I couldn't compare the 2 between each other.  Spumoni is well known for their Sicilian pies (which is thick-crusted) and spumoni, while Grimaldi's is known for baking their pizzas in a coal fire brick oven -- we had their Margherita pizza (thin crusted).  So, it's apples and oranges.  I enjoyed both, but to be honest, my experience at L&B was better than my time at Grimaldi's.  At Grimaldi's the service was meh.  It's like they knew they were famous so they got cocky with it.  We saw the server only 2x there.  To take our drink order and to drop off our pizza.  At L&B's, we were sat family style and had a huge pie on each end of the table. We had their famous Sicilian Pie.  It doesn't say it anywhere on their site, but the way they make their sicilian pizzas is what sets them apart from other Sicilians anywhere else.  Their cheese is UNDERNEATH the sauce so the crust doesn't get soggy from all the sauce.  The secret to their sauce is also why their pizza is delicious.The service was great as well.  The servers were all attentive and made sure we got what we needed to enjoy everything.  They even paired our pizza with a good wine or beer.  Then at the end, if we couldn't finish it, they gave us to-go boxes!  It was excellent!After the pizza, we HAD to try their famous spumoni!  I bought a small one, but they are generous with the serving!  I couldn't finish it!  This place is an absolute must-try when you're around the way!!  You won't be disappointed!!Lastly, they do full pies only -- they take cash and credit card.",6/2/2019,173,355,2197,f3lH2sav685bMGi1lOMdRg
55,Irene L.,1,3,Food is solid. The pizza here is very different from the average. It's square slice is soft and has cheese between the bread and the sauce. The sauce is sweet and their pizza is very good. Didn't see oregano and red pepper flakes. Lines were long and the cashier there accidentally put their finger on my slice. No apologies and wouldn't give me a new one. Very disgusting. It's $3 a slice and the Spumoni ice in a cup is $3.75 for a small. It has pistachios in it and not too sweet.,7/18/2019,124,133,218,rCJd3UN1dXY4X_0KZG_YCA

Anyway, their Sicilian square is probably the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. I'm sad that I didn't get a pie to go to eat at home because I'm drooling for more. Also tried the rice balls which were equally as amazing. The amount of different ice cream options you have is incredible. However, I was boring and settled for a lemon ice. My friend got the Spumoni with layered hot fudge. Let me tell you...That sundae was created with nothing but love. It was legitimately a work of art. I live in Suffolk county but I'm highly considering driving back out there tonight for more since I'm now obsessed. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot upon arrival, so I'm sprinkling that luck on you as well, friend. Stop reading this and go eat.",3/31/2019,262,54,2,izw01Bv3DVh-AVinHLJwgg
58,Raven P.,1,4,"I guess you can say that I'm becoming a pizza connoisseur! I'm at this phase of my life where I'm enjoying slices of pizza by the pie, or square! Spumoni is a great slice of pizza. Crispy buttery flaky squares, I prefer the corner too.Spumoni is special because they make their pizza with a slice of cheese on the bottom and then a sauce on top. Makes it special to add the grated Parmesan cheese.I really enjoy their pizza, but I must say it's nothing to call home crying about. I brought a few slices home for my dad, and I was disappointed by his reaction... He said it was just okay. Either way. I enjoy Spumoni for a few reasons.  If you like : 1.) crunchy buttery crust 2.) saucy pizza 3.) adding toppings 4.) corners - then go here. Ask them to warm your slice too, unless it just came out. You lose the essence when it's not piping hot!Enjoy!",7/17/2019,264,60,265,7vj1B4Gpq0lIkMQ5usJ3EQ

63,Katie G.,1,5,"My best friend is from Brooklyn and has been talking to me about this place for YEARS. On my most recent visit we finally made our way over and I am almost disappointed we did because now I CANT STOP CRAVING IT! Ordering a fairly simple pasta at such an acclaimed Italian eatery felt a little cliche but after tasting it I can assure nothing about this dish was simple. The pasta was perfectly cooked and textured, but the star of the show was the sauce. So rich, creamy, garlicy, and cheesy. Anything you could ask for from a carbonara. Seriously, I'm making my own mouth water thinking back to those first bites.The portions were very generous, especially considering the richness of the meal, so I happily took home leftovers.And while it was a busy afternoon, the service was delightful and attentive.",9/16/2018,218,45,72,TOT9gZGBVzkBhIFO_AXV7g
64,Tiffany O.,1,4,"Review for the pizza/spumoni window onlyyyyyyyy. Maybe one day I'll come to the restaurant.Atmosphere: Came here around lunch time on a Summer Saturday. Pretty busy, parking was packed. We found parking on the street and walked about two blocks, so no biggie. There's plenty of outdoor seating,but on sunny days the umbrella tables get stolen quickly. We ended up at a non-umbrella table, but luckily it wasn't too bad out.Food: Pizza window is quick, which is fantastic! We were in line for less than 2 minutes, and we got our pizza right away. You can specify which slice you want if you're particular, but we didn't care. Ordered three slices and got one corner slice and two side slices. The pizza is DELISH. It's soft, airy, fluffy, and the tomato sauce is the perfect amount of herbs and tang. It's not too oily or cheesy too, which I enjoyed. Overall, solid slice and well worth the price. I take this over Prince Street Pizza any day.Also had to try the spumoni. A small cup is actually a relatively good amount. This was probably the best spumoni i've had. Extremely creamy while also light and had the perfect mix of pistachio and chocolate flavor.Service: Quick.If this place wasn't so far I'd frequent more often, but I'm glad I had a chance to try it finally.",9/11/2018,318,522,1414,BkZNc6o--YKBVEGY5rJhuQ
65,Eddie B.,1,4,"This review is strictly for their famous square style pizza and for their ice cream stand. L & B's have a cult following for their square pizza and its for good reason because you'll never taste anything this good when it comes to this original style of pizza. The squares are special because the cheese goes under the sauce and that makes it unique and extraordinary. This pizza has been critiqued, reviewed, and analyzed by many discerning tastes and I'm definitely going to add to it. The crust is crispy and charred slightly on the edges because they sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese all the way to the edge which lends to the delicious flavor. Besides being crisp it's also soft and chewy with a very pleasant yeasted flavor. Because the cheese layered directly over the dough, it adds to the supple texture of the dough. A layer of particularly sweet marinara goes over the cheese and then sprinkled with grated Parmesan and finished with olive oil. All these layers and ingredients make for a spectacular slice of pizza. When you're done with the pizza, save space for the spumoni. To any non-New Yorker, spumoni is a pistachio flavored ice which comes rippled with green, yellow, and brown layers. It's unique just like the square pizza and it's refreshing and a great way to end your meal. Another flavor that's not to be missed is the orange and vanilla creamsicle swirl. I actually prefer it over the spumoni because that's not a flavor combo that's common and I can't resist having it.",2/12/2019,150,123,2248,huqr_MnkdAh682GIwUjfFg

69,Eddie T.,1,5,"One of the most famous pizzerias in the Tri State Area. What L&B are known for is their square grandma/Sicilian style pies. Get them hot and fresh at the walk-in window and you won't be disappointed. Square slices are different than your thin crust as they have a thick doughy crust with more sauces on it. If you like that, then this is the place to get it. I've also gotten an order of their Eggplant Parm and I believe that it is one of the better Eggplant parm I've had. The roll is crunchy because it is toasted right before it being served. The mozzarella and sauce on it makes it so much better. Another must get at L&B's is their spumoni. Spumoni is a sorbet like ice cream but with much better flavours. It's homemade and it's unique. My favorite is the combo trio of vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. I usually get two scoops of it on a cup and I'm satisfied. As popular as L&B's is, the busiest times are during the summer. Finding a parking during weekends and dinner at summer time is almost impossible and there is always a crowd. I guess that is the price you have to pay for quality pizza and Italian food.

I'm a big fan of bread so I enjoyed it despite it not being a typical slice with cheese lol.I decided to try their pasta subsequently after my first visit. Both times I ordered their shrimp scampi over linguini. The first time having their pasta and I noticed this distinct odd taste that I couldn't put my finger on. The flavor wasn't unsavory but it wasn't too pleasant. It was a flavor I never tasted before, but still somehow tasty. It tasted way better the next day. The second time I ordered that same entree, that odd taste from the first time was very overbearing and I couldn't enjoy it this time around. I don't know if it's the oil or the wine that gives it such a pungent taste. The shrimp is okay.Service is regular.

82,Simon W.,1,4,"I'm not sure what the hold is that L & B has on me.  I have to admit that I dig the pizza here.  I don't get why.  I don't think that the ingredients that are used are of high quality or that there is a proprietary technique in the making of the pizza.  Maybe it's just that the pans that they use have just accumulated so much flavor over the years making the crust awesome.  The crust is sort of a deep dish like and has a textual contrast with a crusty bottom and velvety top.  The mozzarella here is layered below the sauce, married to the top of the crust.  The tomato sauce on top is just a bit sweet but not too much.   Finally, there are clues to the existence of some salty parm on top.  I'd also say skip the toppings here, you don't need them.   I always find myself grabbing a half pie when I am in the area or sometimes when I am not.  You can't beat a midnight slice of heaven after dinner and so what if you have leftovers, they make great breakfast options also.  I can definitely attest to that experience.  hehe,...Once you move past the pizza the spumoni is pretty good also.Parking can be a little tight but generally not to big of a problem.  If picking up, you can double park for a few mins as long as there isn't a police cruiser around.  (Heck, even the 5-0 like good pizza too right?!?!)

83,Kevin V.,1,5,This brooklyn institution has to be tried for all pizza lovers. L&B's pizza is allIn their pans their pans have been in circulation and building up flavor since it opened. The pans and those ovens give there square slices this unbelievable amazing crust. The sauce is sweet yet tangy with great flavor. One of my favorite bites on the whole slice it that little piece of crust with the burnt cheese and just enough of their iconic sauce. A fantastic bite on a fantastic slice.    The ambiance is jut amazing in itself Old school outdoor seating tons of people always because the pizza is that good and a nice indoor side of the restaurant.  As for the Spumoni its old school flare of the stand sold me right away. The spumoni itself was amazing a sweet and smooth spumoni with the perfect amount of pistachios. Can't wait to have a another square at L&B's,7/6/2018,175,125,289,JD3aX8TPtBdKuBGmajahag
84,Sandy D.,1,2,"High ratings. Reviews in the thousands. ""Best"" pizza in NY???When my friends suggested this place for dinner, you best believe I'd be going to put this pizza to the test! The restaurant is quite the trek from train stations. Despite this, it seemed as if the whole town was in this store. There's both an outdoor and indoor area. We ate here at around 8 so the place was PACKED. The hype for me to try these ""World Famous"" Sicilian Pies was real! At $24, the pie was 12 slices. One bite, several chews later, and I became immediately disappointed. I really tried to analyze what the hype was. The pizza is fluffy, I'll give you that. And it's cool that the cheese is under the tomato sauce. But other than that, it just tasted like bread dipped in tomato sauce. I wouldn't recommend the mozzarella sticks either. They're just huge chunks of salty cheese. The only thing I sort of enjoyed was the Potato Croquettes. They had the right amount of flavor at least. Since it's so busy here and everyone is busy attending to someone else, the service is pretty mediocre. We usually had to be the ones to flag down waiters. To accommodate more people, it's also hard to move around the restaurant due to the lack of space inside.Desserts were sold outside. Even though I explicitly said I wanted a large Spumoni, I ended up getting a small one. Thanks for saving me the 50 cents then! The ice cream mixed with Italian ice was both unique and delicious! The pistachio flavor stands out. Good thing my meal ended well. Given that it's such a populated spot, I can forgive the service for being hectic. But the food here wasn't even that good. I would not be coming back.",6/30/2018,305,208,694,cK0b4QGCWmEghFkqboAHfA
85,Trika R.,1,5,"This place is so good! The pizza we had to wait a little longer to get since we had pepperoni added to it but man it was sooooooo darn good, I liked it much better than the cheese pizza. This place is always packed but there is sitting way in the back to the right. The tables usually have toppings but run out quick but go up to the front and ask for more they will refill quickly. The ice cream is really good, the texture seems to be a mixture between ice shavings and cream very distinct but very good. It wasn't overly sweet either. Hoping I make it back soon.",7/5/2018,44,284,133,hiaFk2HOL3oCtM6fmjGc0Q
86,Hannah C.,1,4,"Spumoni is essentially a hybrid type of ice cream, I'd describe it as half ice half ice cream. I recommend getting the rainbow flavor, which includes pistachio (actual nut chunks too), vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, I believe. I loved the tiramisu ice cream flavor. Each scoop was $3.50. Huge space, lots of picnic tables outside as well as an indoor dining area. The indoor dining was packed. Outdoors, you get in a separate line, one for ice cream, one for pizza only, and the one inside is for apps, entrees, pastas, beer, etc. I saw Corona and Heineken as the beer options, sold in cans. The lasagna was delissshhh ($13). The calamari ($14-15) was also good. HUGE portion. We got the famous square slice. It's ok. I'd probably say Prince St is better. Too much dough ratio comparison with the sauce. The crust is crunchy though. Great, friendly, loud, family friend group vibes. I'd want to come back with a group and get their insane sundae that's like 2 feet long.",6/30/2018,660,434,1110,WfiilB5OXV7vSmHP-80n-A
87,Andrew K.,1,5,"It doesn't get any better than L&B. The atmosphere, vibe, food and desserts. Its a staple in the NY pizza game but also not one of those posh or hipster joints. Its still got its neighborhood vibe and homey type experience. Its usually always packed, a line is typically all the way back to the fencing but its well worth the wait. Grab 2 slices and of course some gelato afterwards.",2/11/2019,388,121,149,B84U6lanAqmupVluYpSpSQ
88,Dalia E.,0,5,"I've been to spumoni's a few times now and every time I'm in Brooklyn, I need to stop by spumonis for their pizza.  It's addicting.  There's a thin layer of cheese but the majority of the pizza is sauce.  You have to grab a slice while it's hot (we usually order a full tray) and end up taking the rest home... or ever ordering another tray to go.  The pizza is just as good cold or reheated.  They have a lot of out door seating so it's perfect during the summer and have a few table and seats in the pizzeria part of the restaurant.  If you love pizza and love sauce, this is the place to go.",4/30/2019,131,28,82,4jxTMUKk0oUDbGpuO1eehQ

90,Darshan S.,0,5,"I am usually not a fan of sicilian pizza with a slightly sweet sauce. But, this place truly mesmerized by taste buds. This place serves classic upside down sicilians. The cheese is super gooey which made the whole experience a delightful treat to my tastebuds. The square slice is not crispy. It is thick and a bit damp in texture given a lot of sauce goes onto the pizza top. If you are a fan of crispy pizza crusts, you can request the servers for a corner square slice.They have a dine in family restaurant as well. Expect long waiting lines for the dine in restuarant.",12/30/2018,117,23,10,Tlu0IvdXNNEDGwsQyg8E5g
91,Nadine R.,0,4,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant to go to when I'm in Brooklyn. The square pizza is the best and you can't leave without bringing a pie home. The parmigiana sub sandwiches are delicious too. Save room for an icee afterwards! I would love to give L and B's 5 stars but the service inside is terrible. Service is very slow and the food doesn't come out at the same time. The last time I was there, everyone was finishing their food when my sandwich came out. It was nearly impossible just to get water after being seated. The salads with meat are overpriced and the bathroom is very tiny. I hope they improve because I'd love to go back soon.",7/7/2019,0,15,5,dqBVRqybJEQa3ltCWiMg_Q

93,John G.,0,3,So let's start with the round pie it's still OK not great just OK Sicilian pie or the Square pie not like he used to be it's still Dowie they don't cook it correctly the taste 80% the same.Will I go back for another slice absolutely do I recommend it yes just make sure it's cooked you don't want it to be downie that it looks like the cheese but it's not the cheese it's raw pizza.,4/20/2019,0,6,3,-d8_8bEV6w-goymHeBbseA
94,Daniel P.,1,4,"I guess for me it was a bit over hyped up.  This place is very well known and I was extremely excited to try it but fell a little short of my expectations. The sauce is one of the best I ever had on a pizza but it really lacked cheese and it was not crispy at all. I would consider it very good pizza but not the best I've had, I would recommend this because it's still worth trying.",1/7/2019,328,124,160,60EKGQVek531MYvUQ_JlUA
95,Gregory U.,0,5,"This place is a little off the beaten track in Brooklyn, if you're in Manhattan you can combine coming here into visiting Coney Island as it will take about 30-40 mins from Times Square to get here. The Staff is super fast and have a great system.....you are not waiting on the restaurant but everyone else finishing up from their meal. The cheese was perfectly melted in the way that they cooked it. The tomato sauce had an incredible taste to them after being at the top of the pizza. Overall, great atmosphere with average pricing (even by NY standards!). Would definitely recommend for those who want to experience a Brooklyn original.",6/23/2019,25,12,9,m1KY3jr__HLU05ZIRq_9Pw

98,Brittanny K.,1,5,"When you come to NY most people talk about wanting to try the best pizza the city has to offer. I have to say you will find all of the top pizza places (in my humble opinion) in Brooklyn! And L&B Spumoni Gardens is at the top of the list as the most iconic and delicious pizza place there is. You go to some random party you're going to have Spumonis.You show up at a baby shower-Spumonis. Graduation? Spumonis. Sunday night football? Spumonis. Coming back from a European trip away and the customs officer says have some Spumonis for me? Priceless. Now getting there is another story. Don't be like the many pizza-buzzed idiots who triple parallel park in front of the business on a busy thorough way. Be smart and park down the block and enjoy the walk. You're going to need the cardio after all those delicious carbs! There's the pizza pick-up window where you can buy by slice (no toppings only) or stand in a long (but moving) line to get a whole pie.  There's definitely a wide range of opinions on which slice is the best. Personally I like going for side pieces. You get that delicious crust and the sauce and cheese always seem to be cooked to perfection on these babies. Corners are good if you're feeling bready and definitely go for the middle slices when you go back for seconds. You can also partake in their famous Italian ice and soft-serve ice cream afterwards if you have room. People rave about the pistachio, but sorry I'm just here for the pizza. And they have a full sit-down restaurant as well if you have patience and can get over the delicious pizza. I haven't got there yet. Baby steps. So if you find yourself in south Brooklyn, or really if you're ever in Brooklyn in general, make the trip to L&B Spumoni Gardens. You're in for a real treat!",8/7/2018,223,109,346,vVU_EzpJbhogIfsxaE45tA
99,Sara M.,0,5,This is my favorite pizza place in town. I always make sure to take my friends here. Nobody can too their Spumoni. If you're looking for some quality pizza and spumoni this is your place.,7/5/2019,345,3,0,xU2p6dJlym0nbaOv8bvLlw
100,Allison T.,1,5,"I grew up up the block in the housing projects and this place was epic for pizza and spumoni. No other place even tried to compete. Whenever I have a craving for good pizza think of how great their slices are. I mention ""L&B Sicilian Slice"" to my family and they would drool.Funny thing is when I was growing up there, only folk who ate in the dining area were... not loving of the law who could be listening, or tolerant 100% of people of 'the colored persuasion'. So.... I can't say I've ever eaten anything else but the pizza and the spumoni, and my parents never even tried to go further than that when feeding us there. We'd eat on the outside tables with everyone else in the heat of the summer, enjoying awesome pizza and sunshine. Plus I've heard from folks who say they dined on other food it ""wasn't great anyway, stick with the pizza every time.""I've taken a few folks here to taste 'real pizza' and they've made Brooklyn memories with food. Pizza here is good enough, it needs no toppings. Every other pizza I've been given I judge the crust vs. the sauce vs. the cheese, and have yet to find a place that makes ALL of that great. L&B is the only place. The spumoni is creamy and icy and demands a big glorious spoon; buy enough to share or eat late at night.Going back recently and seeing tour bus loads of multicultural folks eating in the dining area and wandering was adorable to me. I just hoped the pizza recipes hadn't changed. And nope, everything still really guuuud.What will trick you is how the pizza looks plain. The square slices look like they have no cheese, or are old. The staff mega-friendly, you almost expect the food to be bad. But oh how surprised you will be. It's a Must Try.",12/18/2018,83,118,37,KWS-nI3gjbQNg1uwSpOZxA
101,Matthew H.,1,5,"I trekked 30 subway stops plus a two mile walk to get here. It was well worth the trip. The pear salad to start was refreshing.

You really cant go wrong with any type of Pizza but this version just makes every thing better!  There is plenty of seating and a lot of people who seem to enjoy it!",11/27/2018,595,712,2776,Ot-ODtUth8kGGujm_AscdQ

105,Joseph P.,1,4,"Like going back in time to the 1950s or 60s, L&B's is one of a dying breed of one-off family owned restaurants that's been around long enough and popular enough to earn the distinction of ""institution"". A rambling place that's been added on to over the years---starting as a spumoni stand---now with several seating areas each with its own feel:  outside picnic tables, walk up counter, a side room that's like a pizzeria, and a restaurant that's hostess and waiter serviced.  There are Roman statues, crystal, smoked mirrors etc to set the old Italian-American Brooklyn mood and a clientele to match including extended families, locals, big eaters, hit men and hipsters. If you go...you must order two things: the broiled artichokes and the Sicilian pizza. No slices; whole pies only and no credit cards accepted; cash only.

Maybe their spumoni is better, but I haven't tried that yet. Pizza: this is no Di Fara's but it was a solid pie. Haven't tried their world famous Sicilian pie. So this might not be completely accurate review however the round pie was certainly different from other pies I've had usually. It had a slight sweet and nutty flavor. The pie is not completely like a classic New York slice however it's not thick either. I will be back for more to try their Sicilian pie.",5/25/2018,7,108,191,G4V9Fj3fMvLsQ3TZpYl3Ug

119,Wendy W.,1,5,"Every visit here should be dedicated to getting Sicilian pizza. The Sicilian, or square, pie is so good. Nice robust red sauce (and lots of it) sits atop perfectly melted cheese and a nice crispy bottom and crust. One pie is $24 for 12 slices, which isn't too shabby at all. The slices themselves are thick and hefty. I inhaled four for lunch and was done for the rest of the day.Skip the round pies, they're disappointingly average. The pastas aren't any different than what you'll get at most decent Italian restaurants. The only other thing you get here should be the spumoni. It's in the name after all. This mix between ice cream and Italian ice is a good way to round out the meal, especially the rainbow version (which combines vanilla, chocolate, and straw--nope, it's actually pistachio). If you're ordering inside the restaurant you can only get the large three-scoop size, so order from their takeout window if you want the two-scoop small. You can also get a pint to go.A tip I learned from my friend: If you're ordering square slices from the takeout window, you can request a corner slice, middle slice, or one-sided crust slice if you have a preference. They're all fantastic though.",3/25/2018,139,211,947,4zu7xA2uDDVnnjeZSOQblw

121,Kim B.,1,5,"We ended up here by accident, after an accidental day at Coney Island. By accident, I mean we didn't intend for any of that to happen, but it was worth the wrath of Coney Island to try L+B. This is hands down, our favorite pizza in NYC, in the world. That says a lot, since I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur. We ordered a whole pie for 3 people, and were amazed when we finished it... oh wait, it was just that good. The ordering is a bit hectic and confusing, but thats all part of the experience. They also have a great indoor seating and entire menu, which I am sure is amazing. Next time we accidentally go to Coney Island we will have to make a reservation to try it. The overall vibe is very family friendly, feels like you are at a drive in theater or ice cream store.What makes this pizza so delicious is the crust, the thick square slice, the cheese being under the sauce, the corner pieces... everything about it is worth a 1 hour trip from Manhattan for.",11/30/2018,341,769,144,pN7qHvZUKtVzwFfWx65-4A

Ok,ok, I might be biased because i've been eating L & B since before I can remember, and so has my family but this place is really good!  The Sicilian slice is 'upside down' with the mozzarella on the bottom then sauce and topped with grated cheese.  Slices are small so you can eat a few more than you might typically therefore, depending on the size of your group I suggest getting a half or a full tray of Sicilian.  Who am I kidding, even if you're eating alone get a half tray, you can never go wrong with leftover pizza!  When the weather is nice I suggest 'dining in', and eating at one of their outdoor, iconic red tables.  Then finish off your meal with non other than a Spumoni ice from their ice cream parlor.",10/26/2018,208,48,111,UukHWA6HgGA_b4shTaDXkw

128,Eva L.,0,2,"Honestly I usually only come here for the pastas. I love my carbs smothered in sauce and it was that kinda craving tonight. It was a groggy Tuesday night and we were a table of three, and was seated immediately with no wait. Service was severely lacking tonight. The waiter took almost 15 minutes to even come to our table and just started taking our orders immediately. There was no introduction, no smiles, no pleasantries. We ordered two appetizers, two slices of pizza, and a pasta. Our appetizers were brought out by another waiter. And maybe 15 minutes later, the pasta dish came out. 20 minutes had passed and still no pizza so we asked one of the bus boys and let him know we're still missing the pizza. We saw him speak to our original waiter and maybe 10 minutes later our pizza finally came out. Throughout this whole ordeal, we saw our waiter check in with several tables but never check in once with us. Finally after our dinner, one of the bus boys asked if we would like the dessert menu and another one took our orders and brought it out within 5 minutes. Then our original waiter brought us our check mid dessert and proceeded to sit down at another table and have a 10 minute conversation with them.I was expecting mediocre service but it was beyond subpar. The only saving grace and reason for the two stars was the peach icee and the exceptional bus boys who seemed to pick up the slack from the original waiter. I understand everyone has their off days but the least I expect is actual service. Not only did we receive none,  we didn't receive an apology or acknowledgment that they forgot our pizza. Meanwhile, our waiter had the time to take a smoke break and not one minute to check in with us or even make eye contact when taking our orders. Next time, we'll dine outside since we would probably be better off servicing ourselves.",9/11/2018,107,25,38,67jPVfPJQkXax1kV9SLn9A

134,Sara L.,0,3,"As a Brooklynite I consider this place a novelty I bring out of towners to when they ask me to. The pizza is good, not the best, and the restaurant food is mediocre compared to other Brooklyn options for Italian. The open air dining is one of the most Brooklyn things you can do on a summer night, which is nice, but hectic.

We got the veal and meatball parm. Both were loaded with meat and perfectly coated in sauce and cheese. The restaurant itself has somewhat of an odd layout. It's divided into 3 sections: one door leads to pizza and pie orders only, another door leads to ice cream and other menu items, and the final space is dedicated to a dine-in restaurant. They have ample seating outside, so I recommend coming here if you're looking for a casual meal with a large group.",10/13/2018,378,95,199,IpatIliJKqCR6Qk2TNxu3g

You have to try the Spumoni icecream too. I was in heaven with all of the amazing food.Came on a Saturday night with no reservation and it was only a short wait to be seated in their dining room. This place is the real deal Italian food. I highly recommend the brocolli raab and sausage entree, comes with your choice of pasta and and those ooey gooey rice balls just melt in your mouth.

When I ate outside it was very crowded but this place is popular so it isn't their fault and got their famous pizza it tasted good I wouldn't say great only because they burnt our slices so badly it was black and I don't like burnt pizza it's hard to ignore the taste of burnt crust but only two of the four slices were burnt. I also tried their icecream it's good it's creamy but its normal icecream nothing special about it and this place can be pricey depending on if your eating indoors and what your ordering.",6/16/2019,4,4,1,cU8QKQ-PlDaBamnYnN-mxg
143,Peter S.,1,1,"The emperor has no clothing.  Perhaps one of my biggest culinary letdowns.  I've been wanting to come here for years now, and I was so disappointed I wanted to cry.Does the restaurant have a ""colorful"" past?  Yes!!!""Family friendly""?  Yes!!!Is the staff friendly and helpful?  Yes!!!Is the sauce here supposed to be famous?  Yes!!!Do they often make it into the ""best NYC pizza lists""?  Yes!!!Summary: It's a popular place because you get large portion sizes and it's very kid friendly.  And something can be said for that.. just don't expect a world class pizza.  Kids will like it, but I hate it.Square Pizza: C-The sauce was not flavorful, nor tangy, nor savory.  It's simply sweet, like a big tin of Hunt's tomato sauce.  Believe me, I tried to like it.  I wanted to love it.  But the sauce barely had any flavor beyond ""sweet"".  There was no cheese to speak of.  A very light dusting of mozzarella powder, not nearly enough.  The crust was limp.  Not mushy, exactly, but not crispy.  Just... limp.  And it didn't even taste special.  Very ordinary.  And because there's basically no cheese, and almost sauce, every mouthful is nothing more than bland flavorless dough.Spaghetti and Meatballs: C-Same stupidly sweet tomato sauce as the pizza.  And there was almost no sauce at all.  Basically just a whole clump of overcooked spaghetti with a few spots of sauce here and there.  Meatballs had great flavor, but why so big?  They were mutant meatballs... maybe 3 inches in diameter.  What's up with their size?",7/20/2018,315,361,412,Xc4EMKB8V6kc_dzc2cmwDA
144,Barry H.,1,5,"Considered by many to be the best pizzeria it all New York; which would make it one of the best in the world. Can't say that I would disagree, vehemently, if at all.Like Seinfeld's soup establishment, the workers in the pizzeria treat customers poorly, shuttling them around without a single please or thank you.Siciliano slices don't have mozzarella cheese on them. Where I come from that's called a Grandma slice. It IS delicious and nicely well baked. Round slices, as they're cold, have a good flavor traditional make up, but nothing that'll make you give up your own local pizza spot.All in all, excellent food and worthy of consideration, but don't feel like you have to travel the globe to eat here before you die.",1/28/2018,263,485,364,vwAAflM_s9YHHc1U7e82vw

This was my first time having Sicilian pizza so I was excited to try it and see what the hype is all about!Overall, I was a bit disappointed and also just not used to the type of pizza. If you want to order a whole pie you can go to the small side window. It's pretty fast. There's also a sit down area inside if you want restaurant service. The best part was the dough. It was fluffy and thick, with a crunchy bottom. Slighty salty too. The sauce was decent, but not enough cheese. Also wasn't fresh/hot. It felt like I was just eating dough with some sauce on top. Adding the parmesan, oregano and garlic powder on top really helped add flavor. Overall, mostly disappointed by the lack of cheese and the fact they didn't give us a freshly made pizza.",8/25/2018,458,111,162,eEpDDtM6h9adBc-YE1w8KQ
149,Jason C.,1,5,"I'm not a square pizza fanatic as it's usually too dense and hard to eat. My expectations were not very high, but we were doing a pizza tour up through to Boston and wanted to try as many different places and styles as we could. Boy was I glad we choose L & B as our 2nd stop in Brooklyn. The square pizza blew my mind. Sure it's thicc, but not too thick. It's light and doesn't give your jaw a workout chewing for minutes with each bite. The sauce was perfect for me - seasoned, a bit tangy, and not too sweet (it didn't taste sweetened at all to me). Overly cheesed pizza does not appeal to me these days and the conservative sprinkle was perfect for me. The round slice was completely average and served a bit cool; don't come for that one.Ice cream was average, skip the soft serve it's nothing special at all. The spumoni (cream-ice blend) is the stand out, but the hard ice creams are good quality too.On a Thursday summer afternoon (about 2:30) there was no line and plenty of room to sit and relax with our pizza and ice cream.",7/27/2018,103,598,23,yR7c002FKAnehKj3rtexEw

153,Lindsay A.,1,4,"This place is great! Came here with a friend and not one thing was bad- the service and the food were on point and it was a busy Saturday. We didn't have to wait long but because this place is always packed we weren't seated right away.   If you want to order a slice to go or a pie they have a walk up window available with outdoor seating. We decided to eat at the restaurant which was a great choice We had clams with white sauce that were delicious. Save the bread that they give you because the mussel sauce cannot go to waste!  I had an arugula salad with steak and although not the fanciest presentation I have to say this was the best arugula salad I have ever had. The steak for a change wasn't your traditional chopped steak/ cubed beef that you get everywhere else. It was slice nice and thin similar to gyro meat slices and it had just enough meat, fat and flavor. My friend had spaghetti with calamari and the sauce was delish!!  We ended the meal with ny style cheesecake and we will def be back.",8/19/2018,122,48,1,d_OPvoHVzss-cE--KLPKOw

156,Selena Y.,1,4,"Portion sizes are MASSIVE. I shared their World Famous L&B Sicilian Pie as an appetizer with 5 other people (12 total square slices, 2 each), and I was already full by the time our entrees came around. It probably wasn't the best idea to order pizza as the ""appetizer""...but whatever, we loved it! The pizza was delicious - if you have to try one thing off the menu, it's this one. At first I was worried that the crust would be too dense, but it had just the right consistency. Crispy on the bottom and light on top. The sauce to cheese ratio was also spot on. For my entree I ordered the Eggplant Rollatine, which had 3 lightly breaded eggplant slices rolled up and baked with generous amounts of mozzerella cheese and tomato sauce. I could barely finish half the dish - while it tasted nice and satisfying, it was incredibly filling (especially after eating all the pizza). I chose a side of mixed vegetables with it and was disappointed that the veggies were bland and a bit mushy. The pasta side dish is probably the better way to go.The restaurant will only seat you if your entire party is there, so try to get everyone together beforehand. Also, take note that Sundays after 3pm are very, very busy!",1/16/2018,123,470,1572,K7ycpHvXlBkJ1kW0DJawRQ

But I have learned that popular doesn't always equate to GOOD in NYC and I'm sorry (not sorry) that this is absolutely the case with this place. The pizza (traditional Sicilian slices since the NYC style looked gross) was ok. Nothing amazing besides the fact that it was hot out the oven & we happened to go on a chilly day. The dudes serving pizza look like they've been through some ish and are NOT excited to serve you. You sit outdoors unless you dine in. I def would not go out of my way to come here again.

Go with an accomplice, have them wait in the line (because why should you be the one waiting) while you hold a seat for them. Perfect outdoors space, so if you are going to make the trek, wait for the summer weather!TRY the Spumoni ice-cream!

I got the Spumoni ice cream (pistachio, vanilla and chocolate) but found that it was more of an icy than an ice cream. I had to throw it out because it just seemed watery and not at all creamy. (Side note- my partner got the soft serve ice cream and it was incredibly creamy and good). The slice looked like it would be delicious and I was intrigued by the cheese under the sauce, but I didn't find it flavorful. Maybe there wasn't enough cheese or maybe I didn't love the sauce? I would say the place is still worth a trip so you can decide for yourself if it's up your alley. It's been around since 1939!",8/2/2018,232,193,263,XJiREUP4lWGZeUktPaaBTg

174,Lauren G.,1,5,Finally had my first in person visit to L&B ! The pizza came out ridiculously fast (like 5 minutes) we ordered the Sicilian. It was phenomenal- like a deep dish pizza smothered in sauce  I dream about that pizza! The service was also good considering how busy it was. We went at 4 pm on a Saturday and was seated in the side dining room- not my favorite it's pretty slippery! I'm giving it a 5 for food! I would have given a star off for : 1. The bathroom is not within the restaurant so I had to walk outside in the rain around the back through some weird areas to get into a single stall bathroom that was not well kept 2. We were sat at a tiny table and there were chairs stacked behind me so I felt like I was squished the whole time! 3. We were in the side dining room which isn't great 4. Rice balls were not amazing- okay but I would stick with pizza. Make sure to go at an off time- as we were leaving the parking lot was crazy! I also had Spumoni which I am not a fan of - but it's a must try nonetheless - just not my cup of tea but my husband loves it ! The pizza is even great on reheat - hoping to go in the summer and take advantage of the outdoor seating (which is plentiful),1/6/2019,191,237,212,ri2EJbg3MWp19ccShVX0XQ

The chicken piccata is lemony and full of flavor. The chicken is as tender as you can make it.  You cant come to l&b without getting a square so we had that as an appetizer. Unbelievable as usual. One thing about this pizza that is understated is that it is not greasy at all. Amateurs think ny pizza means greasy pizza. It is not true. Good pizza = ny pizza.  Check my pictures out to see how delicous it is!

178,Joanna V.,1,5,This is an NYC institution and anyone who says otherwise can just go live in another city. My husband and friends and I came here after going to the Mermaid Parade in Coney Island on Saturday afternoon. It was around 3:30/4pm. The place was absolutely packed and it was hard to find a seta but we managed to get one. They absolutely know what their doing here and they churn out pizzas really fast. There was a pretty sizable line when we got there but we only waited about 15 minutes in the line and another 5-10 for our pizza. I think they just constantly make them.We got the standard grandma style pizza with the cheese on the bottom and the sauce on top. It is absolutely incredible. The gold standard of grandma pizza in my opinion. The sauce is delicious and the crust is incredible. This is a dense pizza and is pretty filling.They also sell some drinks and a round pizza and pizza by the slice.

181,Kisha V.,1,4,The pizza is delicious and fresh. You definitely have to try it!! I wish they would have more drink options and they should put different flavored wings on the menu.

I visited the pizza/pick up side and after a few minutes lucked up on a table that would accommodate us as we devoured our pizza. We ordered the Sicilian pie and it was the best I've ever had. No bs. The dough was perfectly soft in the middle and crisp on the bottom. The sauce.... magnifico! Who would have thought that a meatless pie with little cheese could be so impressive? Not me. But I am believer now. Thanks so much! Oh, parking is horrible but it's because it's Brooklyn and the pizza is that good. Just a heads up.",12/12/2018,6,47,10,yyeAxx95Iupm4dfQFihhaw

185,Se C.,1,4,"Took me two hours to take the subway and walk to here from the Bronx. I've always wanted to come here after seeing it be featured on Man vs Food. The price for a single slice of pizza here is affordable. The square pizza has a sweeter taste than the triangle slice and it is just simple and good. Fresh is best. Hot, chewy, moist, filling. They sell pizza at both doors, but one is express and the other is a sit down full service. They also serve ice cream at the door where the full service place is. I was not a fan of the spumoni ice cream here. The pizza is world's better than their ice cream.",1/29/2018,273,450,899,GsX2X-dqnY0tf7r1KBS4aQ

This is what I would assume is a great square slice, nice sauce, $3 a cut. My dough was a little too charred and I had a corner piece so I wouldn't rave about it.Spumoni was just OK... Texture wasn't ideal, and while there were a lot of diced nuts, they were no fruit (was hoping for cherry).

I had a piece with nothing on it, but they have some Parmesan cheese, crushed pepper, garlic, etc. So I added some to other pieces. We ate outside and ordered drinks at he counter.

195,Joseph K.,0,4,"Took home a square pie, calamari, and the Boston Bibb chef's salad - to go. I believe this is a five-star pizza destination and today was a four-star experience. Our pizza was a bit burnt around the edges, a bit too burnt in fact to ignore. The calamari was lightly breaded and crisp with *delicious* side marinara; portion size was a bit skimpy for $14 in this diner's opinion. The Boston Bibb's salad was delicious, with butter lettuce and pears, a lemon vinaigrette with shredded cheese.To sum up, Spumoni's is a well-known, (square slice) pizza destination restaurant. Our summer visit was a particularly busy day and we ended up with a bit of an overcooked pie. They are just too busy to produce the perfect pie every time, but the substance was still there. Come here for the trademark square slice:crispy crust, mozzarella under the sauce, chewy undercrust. Well worth the trip for all you pizza fans out there.",5/19/2019Previous review,285,36,57,GASSlVde-ojS0ryvyJCD6w

198,Michael S.,0,2,"After reviewing numerous recommendations for this pizzeria, I purchased a small Sicilian pie for $24. Unfortunately, the pizza had very little flavor and was cold.  The pizza tasted like undercooked dough with a little tomato sauce. It did not taste fresh. The staff also were not very friendly. As I approached the pizza window, the staff member walks away as I am placing my order. The staff member then returns 10 minutes later with 2 Sicilian pies and gives one to me and the other to the customer behind me. He then asks for the $24 from each of us. It seems like the pizzas are pre-made prior to ordering. There are so many other pizzerias in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens with better quality pizza and service. I would recommend Di Fara's if you want good quality pizza and to remain in Brooklyn. This place feels like a tourist trap.",2/20/2019,0,11,10,anhtLPq_kcZK-_Qg3uBYoA

That is not original. As soon as I ordered my pizza, I knew exactly why Spumoni Gardens is THE IN PLACE for pizza.Their square pizza is out of this world and what it makes it unique is that the sauce is on top of the cheese AKA upside down pizza. Last summer, I finally got the chance to eat in the restaurant part of Spumoni Gardens and I was also more than satisfied. I was  considering getting one of their meals but even in the restaurant, I succumbed to getting the pizza because IT IS REALLY THAT GOOD.",5/20/2018,174,85,17,Mn3n-rx76sKGtLVZO20Jpg

But today I went with my family to eat and let me tell you, the food was far from the superb reviews that are posted. We started off with a few appetizers such as the classics: calamari and fried zucchini sticks. Both were over cooked too crunchy and you can taste oil. I was very disappointed with that.The wait staff was on their toes constantly changing out the plates for new ones, napkins etc. multiple times the waiter came by to see how we were doing. I give him 10 stars on that. He was excellent, I don't recall his name though. I never got the chefs special steak but I said what the heck let me order it today. So I ordered it medium and the outside of it was so charred I couldn't eat it. I asked the waiter for some sauce and he gave me A1 and some Marsala glaze. This still didn't help. At the end of the night I had to let him know that it wasn't good. I'm not too sure if I will return to L&B. Seems like the food went down hill.",12/16/2018,3,30,22,fcA8LX5ctpr7zELRHa3DMw

I went with the group so we each got a hero, and split them into four pieces each. We got the chicken Parmesan, veal cutlet Parmesan, meatball Parmesan and the sausage and pepper hero.

213,Jeannie T.,1,5,"Oh, where do I start?! SUPER Satisfied and stuffed after my dining experience here. *Burp* Took six containers to go after my meal, so much food left over. Just couldn't eat anymore.I came here with family and friends to celebrate my sister's birthday and we opted for the Chef's Tasting menu.  Chose our entrees and pasta dishes (2 of each) and the rest is their standard. Given we had not been here before and noticed the huge line for the Pizza, had to try.  While NOT included in the tasting - the restaurant allowed me to order a small pizza pie to share as an additional starter (for the kids). The pizza is excellent!  Tomato sauce was robust - hint of sweet and herbs.  The slices were thin and the highlight was the dough. The dough was super soft inside yet had a nice crispy crust on the outside.  The tasting menu featured appetizers of: rice balls (ground beef, veg, cheese-y goodness, so delish), Baked clams were a standout (breadcrumbs and sprinkled parmesan, then a fried shrimp and cocktail shrimp platter combined. Second serving was the ginormous salad plate.  We're talking a mound of bib lettuce, sliced tomatoes (long side), red onions, olives, all topped with fresh mozzarella. There was so much cheese, you could barely see the salad beneath. I am a fan. The two pastas we selected were the penne a la vodka and the linguine with white clam sauce. Both were al dente and excellent. Penne with the sauce was rich and slightly creamy.  The linguine was perfect, loads of garlic and olive oil.  The clams were small but plenty. For the entrees (you can choose two - steak, veal, pork or fish) - we chose the steak (medium) and the pork chops. OMG, must see the photos... the pork chops were a standout in taste and appearance. Balsamic type sauce yet sweet notes of raspberries and herbs.  It was drizzled all around the massive bone-in chops. Super moist pork chops.  And the sauce didn't over power the natural flavors coming from the meat. Loved both entrees - highly recommend both.By the time it came to dessert, all part of the Chef's Tasting... boy was I stuffed.  I did not have room to eat it but I was happy to try!  The dessert platter had two slices of cheesecakes and chocolate cakes. Also featured tartufo, sliced for visual presentation, lots of chocolate sprinkles everywhere and four ice cream cones on the sides.  All complimenting the mountains of gelato.  The waiter was notified it was my sister's birthday so they decorated the platter with a Happy Birthday message. On top of all this deliciousness were the cherries and a lit candle.Overall, everyone was happily stuffed!  Chef's Tasting is a great way to try them out but comes w/ a hefty price (but it also allows a table reservation.  However, if you're willing to stand on line and wait for a table then just order a la carte - but order to share, portions are generous.  By the way, we did a party of 5 for the tasting but it easily fed all 7 of us and still had leftovers.",10/12/2017,394,559,8110,C_SXjo805ECOlzQNLJBmCg

I have been coming here since I was a kid and the pizza is consistently the same great pizza for many years. The prices are a bit steep for pizza but it's definitely a treat to go there and experience the place itself.

Much better than most pizzerias unless you live near another great pizzeria like I do. Crispy but doughy soft crust, nice tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese. Really good.The spumoni ice cream was good but nothing special that (personally) I'd make a trip for. It was good, and it was fresh. Otherwise it was a ""rainbow"" mixture of vanilla, chocolate and pistachio ice cream with toasted almond pieces in the pistachio. The ice cream wasn't even a creamy premium ice cream but not exactly gelato either. IMO, it was sorta in between lice-milk product, and kind of pricey if you ask me.

225,Chris E.,1,4,"Still one of the best, if not the best square Sicilian slice of pizza I've ever had!If you're visiting L&B, then there's really only one thing you need to order to understand what they're all about ... and that's their famous square Sicilian pizza. There's just something about L&B's square slices. Whether it's the extra dough, the tangy tomato sauce or just the fact it's unlike any other pizza in NYC, there's something special about it and it's no secret to everyone in Brooklyn.Sure, they serve your regular NYC cheese slices. I've never tried it before and there's a good reason for it --- because their square slices are that dang good! Besides their pizza, L&B is also famous for their spumoni (aka Italian ice/ice cream), as well as, homemade ices, regular and soft serve ice cream. If you're not satisfied yet, they also serve pastas, heroes and a plethora of Italian dishes in their indoor dining area. But who are we kidding?! You're here for the square slices, and if it's a warm day, the Spumoni (Rainbow being the most popular flavor)!As for the environment, L&B has a large outdoor seating area and a private parking lot. The parking lot is not big and tends to fill up quickly on busy days/weekends. Many folks tend to double park outside of L&B to pick up Sicilian pies as well so the area gets very crowded.Bottom line --- L&B's square slices are worth every penny. Although they aren't big slices, their unique flavor and texture make it some of the best pizza in NYC. Also, you get a much better deal if you decide to get a pie at 12 slices for $24 instead of an individual slice at $2.75.",9/11/2017,545,1176,10495,m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ

229,Matthew W.,0,3,"Although this place is known as a national treasure, it's hard for me to see this as anything other than just an ""above average"" restaurant.  The pizza is good but horrifyingly greasy but the spumoni is delicous and I've never been disappointed in anything I ever ordered from there.The parking lot is a joke and parking in general around this place is almost impossible.The neighborhood also isn't very scenic (right across the street from dozens of project buildings) and the clientele is some of the rudest in Brooklyn (people will be more than happy to yell at you for not taking your turn in line, even if there are people in front of you, which is interesting).It's a nice place to try once but... unfortunately... it is.... well... very forgettable.  There's nothing here that you can't get better at virtually any other self-respecting Italian restaurant or pizzeria in Brooklyn.I used to live only a few blocks away from this place and went here dozens of times and... quite frankly... I was never blown away by anything I ever experienced or ate there. Slightly above average Italian restaurant which has long lost its roots. And on an unrelated note, it would appear that just a few years ago, one of the co-owners were gunned down, supposedly by the Mafia, for some kind of shady dealings.  Might be a hint as to the downfall in the quality of this place over time.  Or it could be heresay.  In any case... give it a try... but don't expect the hype to live up to reality... because it won't.",11/16/2018,1,25,0,L0uiIGU0ENynYvWbGiVxEA
230,Wilfredo A.,0,4,"The Sicilian square is unlike any Sicilian square I have ever had. Bubbly sauce and generous slices of mozzarella in between a cruncy even slightly buttery tasting crust. The half tray is almost ready immediately upon ordering since they are so popular. The Italian ices next door are also delicious. I only took away one star because their slices aren't that good compared to other pizza spots in the neighborhood and unless you order a fresh pie, you can expect a cold slice.",5/2/2019,0,5,0,0VM9dn4vYY4BZASBUFuLFg
231,Brittany A.,0,5,"These five stars are strictly for the square pizza. The in house dining isn't great. However, the pizza is a staple - they essentially make it"" upside down"" from what most people are used to, by putting the sauce ON TOP of the cheese instead of vice versa. In the summer the outside tables are great, however in winter get that half square pie to go. The service for the pizza is extremely fast. The lot is great, but it's usually pretty full since people from all over are visiting this Brooklyn hot spot. I would like to say I am well versed in pizza and this place really is top notch. Also, don't forget to grab that Spumoni ice cream as a refreshing way to end your meal!",3/13/2019,8,4,0,f6FaX0zdPGe2_a_-Rx6zmw

235,Tina M M.,0,1,"I am happy to announce I will never return to this place that used to be my staple for fresh seafood. We were seated and waiter finally came over and took the order. We ordered fried calamari, shrimp fra Diablo,  seafood salad  and pasta with broccoli. My husband gets his in a deep small bowl 23.95 we are waiting and waiting for the rest of the food to come 10 minutes later to get tasteless fish salad in a deep small bowl that I couldn't even eat it with out it toppling over I used 9 lemons still didn't help. My husbands fra Diablo was dry and whatever residue of sauce was on it was gross. The bill was 78.00  when the waiter came to collect the dishes clearly all the food was still there he never even asked how was everything. Just scooped up the dishes and that was that. I went over to pay with credit card and told the hostess that I was displeased. While putting my credit card through she called the waiter over and told him. He asked me what we had and he said ohhhhhh lmaooooo. Well I believe I will never be returning to this gigantic overrated ripoff who doesn't care about their customers concerns rather just snatch the credit card  out of your hand. Don't get me wrong people are flocking there perhaps they have no tastebuds left in their mouth or they simply just want to go to the famous l&b which is no longer what it was.

236,Joe C.,1,4,"An InstitutionIn reality, L&B really needs a couple separate restaurant reviews, since it's three venues rolled up into one. There is the pizzeria, Spumoni stand, food counter & sit-down restaurant. I have yet to eat in the sit-down restaurant, but have been to the other three areas.PIZZERIA: The pizza at L&B is great. So many people come to L&B looking for the ""best"" pizza in NY, but they are on a fools' quest. NY is home to some of the greatest pizzerias in the world, so what's ""The Best"" of the best is matter of personal taste. The round pizza is served with a very thin crust, and usually not charred on the bottom. I find the sauce to be a bit too boring, which is why when I am there I opt for the house specialty, which is the squared Sicilian slice. The Sicilian slice at L&B was an acquired taste, but it only took one bite. The square sits on your plate like a spongy island of dough, with a dark red tomato sauce glistening on top like lava from a volcano. I am partial to corner slices, because I love the black-charred crust and find the sauce can be a bit too much to handle on a center-cut piece. Delicious!!!SPUMONI: Best value in NYC hands down... You can get a giant soft-serve for $3 that would otherwise be $5 at Carvel or Baskin Robins... But if you go to L&B you MUST try the SPUMONI... This cold confection is a homemade masterpiece.ATMOSPHERE: The food is good, but eating outside in the middle of Brooklyn is the best. What a place to get fat on good food and people watch. It doesn't get any better.If you travel to Brooklyn, you have to try this classic.Thanks",3/14/2018,2173,998,173,eiiXoxbl2nzTy3VTsOd-Qw
237,Abigail M.,0,5,"I've lived in NYC my whole life and have eaten, without exaggeration, probably a ton of pizza at this point. I first came here only a few years ago and my life changed - the square pizza (what you're supposed to come here for - don't you dare get a round pie) is to DIE for. Easily the best square slice in NYC and likely the entirety of the United States. I'm uprooting my life to Europe this week and my friends made sure to take me here one last time yesterday evening. The pizza is just as perfect as always and I will dream about it until I return.",9/12/2018,0,12,0,KBhVUNR3Md6Pxhw8iCa41w

I wish they have it without the almonds but then it wouldn't be spumoni.,11/18/2018,6,31,29,kMZ7ChnlzI2Lopna3LalSg
247,Jocelyn K.,1,4,"Finally made it to this Brooklyn pizza institution. It was incredibly packed on Sunday even during supposedly off peak hours. My friend came around 2:15pm and said there was a table open and it was fairly empty. Unfortunately we were stuck in traffic and got there around 3pm. By then, crowds of people started coming. It's first come first serve and your whole party has to be there. We waited maybe about 30-40 min. for a table of 6. I guess in hindsight when we went probably was peak hours since it's right when people get out of church.They have a parking lot, but it was full, so we had to find street parking. They have a pizzeria on the left for takeout, inn the middle you can order ice cream/pastas/apps, and to the right is the sit-down with service. They also have so many tables outside but unfortunately it's too cold. Probably great to come in the summer. They have bathrooms in the sit-down area, but only for those who get a table. The rest have to go around to the restrooms behind the building. Restrooms in the sit-down area are pretty clean. I wouldn't come here for anything but the pizza. The rest of the food is rather average. My boyfriend ordered the Baked Clams. He said there was way too much bread crumbs. They were also tiny ass clams. I thought baked clams were usually the larger ones. I ordered the Fried Zucchini and Mozzarella in Corrozza. Don't get the zucchini. It was soggy and bland even with the marinara sauce. The zucchini was so thin, it was pretty much just breading. The whole thing needed salt. I usually love fried zucchini, but this has to be the worse fried zucchini I've had so far. The the plate is huge though. The Mozzarella In Corrozza tasted like savory french toast with mozzarella in it. Bread had that french toast eggy flavor. It's basically a fried mozzarella sandwich with tomatoes and a savory, buttery sauce. The bread has that french toast eggy flavor. I'm not sure I would order again, but it was interesting. Finally onto the reason why you should come here: the Scilian and the ice cream. My table ordered a whole pie which comes with 12 pieces for $24. I loved the tomato sauce, since it was so flavorful and tangy. The crust was light and airy. Not dense like I thought it would be. I think it could have been more buttery and crispy though. It was on the soft and spongey side.My friend told me I had to get the hazelnut ice cream. I decided to get half spumoni and half hazelnut. Little did I know they only have one size and it's like 4 scoops of ice cream for only $4.75. Unfortunately, no one wanted to share with me. It was a really excessive, monstrous cup of ice cream. #firstworldproblems. The spumoni turned out to be chocolate, pistachio, and vanilla (cremolata), but mostly vanilla. The pistachio had an almost sorbet-like texture. I couldn't really place the taste of the vanilla. I really liked the gritty texture from the nuts. My favorite was the hazelnut ice cream. It had a harder texture and the hazelnut taste was strong. We were all surprised at how the ice cream did not melt at all.I think I prefer Prince St. Pizza, but I definitely want to come back during the summer. Next time I know not to waste stomach space on anything but the pizza and ice cream.",2/9/2018,480,894,4994,DC1hfeeSaYr2E1xwiEL81A
248,Matt L.,1,3,"Eh, I don't get the rave reviews from all the Coney Islanders.Went to the boardwalk, then took a one stop train trip to L&B. What we found was that there's either indoor seating with waiter service, and a full menu, or outdoor seating, which seemingly only has access to the pizzeria and the frozen ices/ice cream etc. I actually saw some people eating calamari while sitting outside, and I'm not sure how or where they got them, but there might be a way to eat non pizza items while sitting outside.The pizza spot has two basic options: either the regular pies, or the sicilian pies. You can order individual slices, but you'll only have access to plain/cheese. If you want to get a whole pie however, you can add your own toppings, which include some things like pepperoni, mushroom, etc.Honestly, I thought it was just fine. I came here because I saw someone on reddit raving about L&B, but it turned out to be just fine. I liked the sicilian pizza because there wasn't much cheese on it, but overall there's no way I would come all the way from Manhattan just to come here again.

But the owner is pushing 100 and still making the pizza! Even though I lived 3 blocks away, I couldn't wait to visit my grandmother who lived 5 blocks from L&B. Now what should that tell you?

But the place now coasts on it's reputation.I ate maybe around 150-200 square slices from LnB but the last few visits make me more hesitant to return. I was given cold slices and when I tried to get a replacement for fresh hot slices they wouldn't help me. Okay whatever, even cold and stale LnB slices are still decent, but when I went to the window to get change for a $20 to buy a couple more slices he dude at the window said he doesn't have change... LnB... doesn't have change when a slice costs $3 a piece. I guess everyone must be paying with $3 bills then and credit card? Oh wait they don't take credit card.Okay... whatever a bad customer service experience no biggie, let's enjoy some slices. We sit down with about an hour until closing, and are shortly told the place is closing soon somewhat rudely, only our table, no one around us was warned.Horrible first experience for a friend from out of town that I was eager to share the square slice with, I apologized deeply.Not sure if it's the new management, ever since the owner passed away or if I just got unlucky, but I'm more hesitant to return, there is lots of great pizza in NY.",7/6/2016Previous review,6,45,39,UAYyOp0nCyTTyayy3jXxKA

This place is certainly a Brooklyn gem and seems to still maintain that old-school charm and family oriented atmosphere. People on the subway were staring down the leftover box we took home with us--the smell of the pizza and the famous restaurant name toyed with everyone's senses for sure! The Sicilian pie is what they're best known for and it's absolutely the best square pie on earth. Sooo saucy and cheesy. For me, the more sauce on something, the better. And honestly, regardless of the size of the slices, you can still eat a few pieces before getting too full. Tried the spumoni once long ago, would love to give it another chance because it's a classic to this spot. Only ate at the location once before, the other time the pizza was brought back home. Will definitely be making a trip in the future to enjoy another dining experience at the restaurant again.

283,Kevin C.,1,4,One of the hallmark pizza joints in Brooklyn which has been around for a long time. They specialize in square pizza but in this regard a reverse square pizza as the tomato sauce is on top and cheese is on the bottom. You really get a pillowy bready crust which is super thick and chewy. The slight sauce and cheese on top really make a nice whole decent piece. They have a restaurant as well that serves Italian American food. Hits to us were the spaghetti with meatballs. Great pasta with a decent meatball with marinara sauce similar to the pizza sauce. The chicken parm was also breaded nicely and also matched well with the tomato sauce and cheese. Minus for me was the broccoli rabe and sausage. The sausage was great but i think the broccoli rabe water and oil that it was made in just made the whole dish watery and oily which is all that i tasted. In the summer it's great to have a square and sit outside for some spumoni as well a cream like ice cream ice. When ordering the square slices make sure you choose a corner or middle piece. I always like the corner as you get crunchiness from the baking on both sides.,7/2/2018,1575,779,1789,oPmMbyow9CWs8f6An4kAxA

287,Giacomo C.,1,2,"2.5 stars.Their Sicilian square pizza is decent. If they cooked it longer, it could be good, but unfortunately it comes half raw... you can even tell when you look at the square slice, because the dough changes color and texture. The 1/2 tray of Sicilian square pizza costs $24, which is pretty good, considering that it comes with 12 generous squares. The outdoor seating space is spacious, and next door you can buy beers and sundaes. If I lived close I could see myself coming back (and baking it in my oven for an extra 10-15 minutes.

It's good quality pizza, on a completely different level then most regular pizzas. The marriage of the fresh cheese, sweet tomatoe sauce, clean olive oil and the thickness/chewiness of the buttery crust get along so well and play wonderful together. It's definitely a happy marriage :-)My party and I also ordered two pasta dishes; the penne with vodka sauce and the penne with broccoli, oil and garlic sauce. They were ok, nothing special or to rave about. Last but not least, the famous Spumoni itself! I ordered the Vanilla, Chocolate, Pistachio mix. It was very refreshing, light and creamy.

293,Terry B.,0,5,"THE SKINNYBest Sicilian slice I know of, and a backwards one at that. They call them squares, and the atmosphere of this South Brooklyn gem is just as unique as the pizza. If you never had the cross between ice cream and Italian Ice they call spumoni, you should. The NYC Italian-American stereotypes are on display at the loudest volume possible, and anything less would diminish what makes this place so special. It's the most ""Fuggedaboutit"" pizzeria in all of NYC.THE PIZZAI'm not sure if they invented it, but they are definitely the yardstick of a reverse Sicilian slice, a.k.a Squares ($2.75 each). It starts with a golden crispy crust that has a moist chewy layer of dough above it, right below a layer of mozzarella. The sauce is then applied over the cheese with a light dusting of Pecorino Romano on top of that. Basically, it's a Sicilian slice with the sauce on top of the cheese. A first glance would make you think there is no cheese on it. It's very saucy and holds together well.This was the first time I had this since I was a small child and I'm happy to say it is just as good as I remember it. The sauce is bright and tangy, and not overly sweet. The Pecorino Romano gives it a sharper kick than standard Parmesan would. The reverse order of sauce and cheese is not just an eye catching gimmick. I like it better than a regular Sicilian slice and these squares are easily my favorite Sicilian pizza. These are big, heavy slices, so you won't need much to be full. This was not my first pizza slice of the day, so one slice was plenty to hold me over.The regular cheese pizza, or rounds as they like to call them, are very good too! The tomato sauce shines through just like it does on the squares. Nothing mind-blowing, but quality enough to assert that if you live in the area, this is your go to for a regular slice of pizza.Last I knew it was off the menu, but I have seen some really great reviews of their chef's table, and it's a whole lot of bang for the buck. Looking forward to trying that on my next visit along with some Spumoni.THE LOCATIONAs a former New Yorker who remembers and loved this city pre-Giuliani days, I love this location the same way kids moving into Bushwick love Roberta's. There is nothing hipster about this location. It's truly the old Brooklyn that hasn't succumbed to the spread of gentrification on steroids just yet. Rising home prices and rents are pushing the Italian community out of the area fast. What remains is the loudest and proudest of the bunch. Expect to see a lot of tank tops, track suits, big-hair, multiple gold chains on one person, and big booming voices that could be heard two blocks away. I love it! I miss this community and would never order a slice to go. If you want to see where the remnants of the fading Brooklyn Italian community go for pizza, this is the place. Outdoors is the preferred place to sit. It's nothing fancy. A lot of red steel benches, Italian flags, candy-striped umbrellas and a separate counter for ordering. They have indoor seating too. It can get crowded here, but the seating is adequate. It works well as somewhere you hang out and have a long conversation over some pizza, or just somewhere to stop in quick, feed your kids, or grab a slice before you get on with your day. If there was a bowling alley attached to the side, you would never get near this place. Kids love it. It's a great place to go for spumoni and Italian ice, and if you grew up nearby you probably met here many times on someone's birthday or after a little league game.This is the opposite end of Brooklyn, and a good hour subway ride on the D train from Midtown Manhattan. It's not for people who just want to do the standard tourist trip to NYC, but if you live in the city. or are just a true foodie looking to go off the grid and have a unique experience, it's worth the trek. As someone who just wanted to go see if this place was as good as I remember it being from childhood, it was worth it.THE OWNERSR.I.P Lou Barbati. When I saw in the news that he died, I was very saddened. It set off the alarm in my brain that I need to go see all these old NYC institutions before they are sold off to corporate ownership or just close all together in some cases. I'm happy to say this place is still operating, family owned, and they're doing an awesome job. It hasn't changed a bit in both quality and character. I saved my 100th review for L&B's because the sad news did inspire me to get my keister up to NYC and go do all the things I used to love or never got around to doing while I still can. My Condolences to the Barbati family. OVERALLThis restaurant is a Brooklyn institution that is worthy of every good word spoken of it. I don't know anyone who grew up in this community that doesn't get homesick from the nostalgia of L&B's. It's truly an old school Brooklyn original.  If you have the time, and you love pizza, it's a must add to your pizza bucket list",12/18/2017,1184,113,1212,PbXWKMJS_HqqKCcy2lj0RA
294,Gab G.,1,5,An absolute hike for those of us who reside in West Harlem - but completely worth it.

295,Michelle C.,1,5,One of my favorite pizza places in Brooklyn! Nothing beats a good ol' slice of Sicilian!

296,Fleur C.,0,5,"If you ask me my favorite pizza in NY I'd direct you to L&B's! This place is known for their Sicilian style pizza. L&B's pizza is unique in the way that they place the cheese directly on the dough, homemade sauce on top, dusted with a generous amount of freshly grated pecorino romano and last, but not certainly not least sprinkled with olive oil. Every pie I've ever gotten has been freshly made to order with steam visibly filling the air.  The crust and bottom of the pie is crispy to perfection. When you sink your teeth into this slice, its almost like biting down on to a pillow of sweet tomato, cheesey saucy goodness. Anytime I make my way out to Brooklyn I make it a point to stop at L&B's. You're welcome in advance! p.s. if there is any room left for dessert after eating, since I can guarantee that you'll have more than one slice..I encourage you to try their famous spumoni ices!",1/25/2018,3,33,91,-MNkrJdxrCXPj4yaOqAt-Q

303,Mike G.,0,5,"Traveled 70 min to try this pizza, as I've heard their ""square"" pizza is legendary. To start off the location is broken out into 3 sections. A small hole in the wall pizza joint with minimal seating, a take out section where you can see them preparing food as well as an ices and ice cream counter, and a sit down restaurant. All have separate entrences to them. I went to the pizza joint section as I was strictly there for the pizza. When ordering they only have ""round"" and ""square"" pizza. You can only get toppings if you order an entire pie and if you get ""square"" you order either half sheet or full sheet. We went with the half sheet which comes with 12 slices which is what they are most known for.The pizza was awesome, came out hot and very saucy which was perfect and the crust had a nice crunch to it. If you happen to be within the area I would recommend going out of your way to try this pizza. They are also very fast so no matter how many people are in front of you the line goes by fast. For the 45min I was there, people were walking out with half sheets and sheets of pizza non stop.",2/14/2019,123,28,83,K3qjMKnssfJhzgDt8Fccbg

It came with potato croquettes and mixed vegetables or pasta with marinara, I chose the latter. I took a picture but that was after I had begun eating and remembered to try and catch the plating...ooops. I cleaned my plates and was a very happy camper, especially after a very disappointing dinner venture the day before starting with the rude Mamma Lucia's, ending with the bland Joes of Avenue U.This is now my go-to spot!.....I took one star off due to the crazy bathroom situation.

310,Stella G.,1,1,"Came here with family who was visiting from out of town. L&B's reminded them of their childhood so they dragged us here. They grabbed a square pie and after some struggle (there are separate windows for everything and they're a bit confusingly labelled) I got my two regular round slices. Both the pie and the slices were nothing special and as well, cold. If I wanted cold pizza, I would have ordered from my favorite pizzeria, thrown it into the freezer, and saved some coin while I was at it. Honestly, people just come here because of the hype and how much space they have for people to dine outside. It's nothing memorable unless you're a kid and your parents made you frequent the spot growing up, which wasn't the case for me, so I don't see the wow factor. It clearly wasn't an off day, they just serve you whatever they have ready, no matter how long it's been ready for.Just save your money and grab a slice from any other pizzeria.",2/25/2019,360,472,19,_D1IJIac_NqbJJwXiCzz-g

323,Jim B.,1,4,"This place may seem a bit overrated to you, almost as if it benefits from the television and celebrity exposure it has received over the years, like if the Kardashian family sold ""Enemas by Kardashins"", then everyone and their grandmothers would be paying inflated prices to buy Kardashian enemas without consciously realizing that they are still just inserting the same salty water into their rectums that they can do without a name brand enema.Accordingly, it may seem like L&B's is selling the same Italian pie you can get around Brooklyn, but just with more people buzzing around.  I assure you that this is not the case.  The pizza here is as advertised and worth making a detour to go get some.  It's sold hot and fresh, by the slice or square (full pies are called squares), and has the saucy flavor you crave.  I watched them whip up sheet pan after sheet pan of pies that they sold by the slice... They just kept rolling out the door.The pizza side of the establishment is a little tight, with a small eating bar mostly covered in spare pizza boxes and napkin holders, and only a few small tables mostly covered in high school kids and Jets fans.  There is a restaurant side with more seating but I think the interior would benefit from a large scale remodel.  The outside seating is ample and decent but it was too cold when I went there to eat outside.  Maybe if they covered the patio and threw some heaters out there they could do year round seating if they are in to that kind of thing.  So, is say it's best that you do pick up.Considering all the press this place gets it's still very inexpensive: slices are $2.75, and squares are about $25.  So you can shove your Kardashian enemas and other establishment's tomato pies in your rectum all you want and I'm going to L&B's.",3/12/2017,119,358,805,QaOtVVgxD5GYyE9ALuKNQA

Every time I'm in Brooklyn I make it a point to stop here! Their Sicilian square pizza is one of the best I have ever had. I've never dined in here, but there's plenty of seating outside which is nice in the summer time to be able to grab a slice and then finish it off with one of their ices! Parking can be a little difficult and is my only complaint, but you'll forget all about it once you sit down and have a slice of pizza!If you haven't had it yet you're truly missing out",4/26/2017,43,226,353,thpSPlb2O_w4TXmStTnvgQ

331,Jillian L.,1,5,"Probably the best Sicilian slice in New York and did I mention it's only $2.75 a slice?The vibe of L&B's is perfect. Walk up to window, place your order, and in seconds be holding a glorious square of deliciousness. I'll start from the bottom and make my way up. The part of the crust that meets the pan gives the square enough hold so that the entire pizza doesn't fall apart and just the right amount of crunch. The next part of the crust is soft and pillowy, a nice offset to the crisp base. Also, it's the perfect vehicle for all the cheesy goodness that comes next. Lastly, it's finished with an incredibly balanced tomato sauce. Not too sweet, not too sour, but a refined in between. If you're not heading over now, sorry that my review didn't entice you, but if you are, please pick me up a slice...or a whole pie!",3/2/2017,415,335,134,z5zk8fwVPOnfnoFkdQbYWw

337,Brian S.,0,4,"Went on a Saturday afternoon in March. Went into the door on the left and there was a pizza man waiting with a square pie ready for slices. The crust was well cooked and a tad charred which I liked. Upon biting in the crust was crunchy on the outside but a bit doughy toward the middle which blended well with the cheese and tomato sauce. Please do not misinterpret this... it is doughy not raw. The sauce was delicious like it was slow cooked with small chunks of tomato and seasonings and it was topped with mozzarella and Parmesan. I initially ordered two slices, as they are about 6 in by 6 in, but I was quickly tempted for more. The price was reasonable .... for two slices of ""square"" and a soda it was $7.50.  The staff was friendly and the crowd was consistent. You can tell this is a neighborhood landmark by the volume of people and the interactions with the staff. It seems there is a lot of outdoor seating, but again as it was March we ate inside. While we were there no less than 5 cops came in. To me, cops know the best places because they work the neighborhood and have their pick of spots daily. Parking was a bit tricky so if you see a spot , grab it. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.",3/4/2019,0,11,4,nNxJALZolyeLZgsYPItyXQ

Cheese UNDER the tomato sauce, on top of the fluffiest, airy-est crust you'll ever find. Don't feel bad about eating 4 slices, it's mostly air! And you can't see the cheese so it's not unhealthy! Just don't think about it.Their pizza is also great for carry-out. I've been lucky enough to attend multiple L&B pizza parties. Wait, that made me sound like an 11 year old.

343,Karen L.,1,4,"What you need to know: - People come here for their Sicilian square pizza and so should you!!! - Credit cards accepted with minimum purchase of $10 - Family owned business since 1939- The slices taste better when you get it fresh and hot off the pan, instead of getting a half or whole pie (since those have been sitting for just a little while). - $2.75 per slice, $21 for half a pie (12 slices; $1.75 per slice) or $40 for whole pie (24 slices; $1.67 per slice)What I always order: - The famous Sicilian square pizza - at first glance, you may think - cafeteria pizza. But it is anything but! When it is fresh off the pan, the crust is crispy and caramelized, the dough is pillowy, soft and airy, and incredibly cheesy! There is an entire layer of cheese underneath the sweet and tangy San Marzano tomato and oregano sauce, olive oil and pecorino romano cheese topping - so it's a delightful surprise!",2/18/2017,102,200,887,dka-nwnZEak9Qn-xOxYqyQ

361,Lexie V.,0,4,"L&B was recommended by one of my patients as ""the best pizza in brooklyn"". Naturally, I was starving and decided to stop by after work. So glad I did!There are two entrances (from what I saw): one for pizza and the other for ""regular"" food. Like the L&B noob that I am, I of course went through the wrong entrance and was kindly directed to the area where pizza was sold. The menu is simple and easy to understand. From what I heard among the orders around me, there were squares, circles or halves (half a square pie which brings 12 slices.. if i remember correctly). I ordered two squares, receiving a corner and side.  (once you have their pizza you'll know what I mean lol). ON TO THE PIZZA! The slices were fresh and hot, I had arrived right before the lunch rush at 12pm. I'm a firm believer that the sauce makes or breaks any type of italian dish. L&B's sauce was spot on, tangy and delicious. I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the dough that made each bite nice and chewy but either way it was a delightful experience. For my two squares and a pure leaf iced tea my total was $7.50 which I thought was fair. The service was fast and efficient, I didn't hang around long as I just wanted to get my belly full and beat the traffic on the way home. I didn't have a chance to try the spumoni but I took 4 more squares to go. L&B is definitely on my list of favorite pizza places in and around NYC!",12/27/2017,37,41,35,bjJHq9I3He6bY-uJeV4HIw

The food is so mediocre and sometimes less than mediocre. The food has gone downhill over the years.

Now I will flat out say my group did not try any of the ice creams, which in hindsight was probably a mistake but we were so stuffed from our Grandma pizza that we just couldn't bother. The menu is extensive with quality ranging from average to amazing depending on what you get of course (hint: get the Sicilian style pizza and calamari).

374,Mia M.,1,4,"This is my fourth visit/check in. They ALWAYS say hello and goodbye and 'thank you for coming'. Whole staff is attentive. Sicilian pie ALWAYS tastes the same (AMAZING). Alfredo pasta is well flavored and if you add grilled chicken they give you a lot of chunks. Spumoni (ice cream) is pretty good and the presentation is nicely plated. Plastic table cloths, old collector furniture pieces, and the decor really feels like family style and I like it-- very fitting. Worse thing about this place is that they have slippery floors-- be careful, it's just the tile but  luckily they haven't had the wrong customer fall. Calamari is unseasoned but fresh. Once, they ran out of heavy cream when my boyfriend and I came all the way down to try the Alfredo and vodka. Whenever they mess something up (it's not often) they are very apologetic and are all about fixing it immediately and making sure you leave happy. No restaurant is perfect but they aim to please and make sure every walk of life feels welcomed. Mussels in red sauce tasty. Bottom line: this is a REAL family style restaurant with REAL Italian food. Closest I have gotten to real Italian food since living in Italy. It feels like family and I ain't even Italian. Owners/managers/restaurant family crack friendly jokes and actually remember us from the previous visit.

The slices are perfectly prepared and are delicious.  The hero's are totally perfect and you can eat them there or take out or even in the restaurant. All the dishes in the restaurant are very tasty and prepared perfectly.    The pizza types that they have are literally any type you can imagine. I've always really liked just the round type slices/pies, and then tried the square Sicilian ones here and those were amazing too.      They are very knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, and willing to do whatever you need to have a great meal.  I'd recommend them to everyone!",5/21/2018,12,55,8,y1frAfKgRj0hg2INIgK8qw

L & B's calamari was a nice portion, tender, fried perfectly and of course delish. Of course we each had to have a square each, still the best. My wife had Eggplant Siciliano, which is a baked ziti with eggplant parm all baked together like a lasagna. I had Sausage & Broccoli Rabe, with ziti in garlic and oil.

391,Stephanie T.,1,1,"This review is for my latest dine-in experience Overcrowded, over-rated, poor service and bad quality food.The Hostess told us it was a 20 minute wait for a table when we arrived. 40 minutes passed and a couple in their early 40's walks in with their 2 kids, the guy grabs the attention of the waiter, that waiter asks them if they want drinks or anything to eat etc..5 minutes later-a guy comes out and grabs the couple (hugs & kisses exchanged) to be seated. Complete bullsh*t!! Mind you, we waited close to an hour now (not a problem) but after having waited and very hungry another group of people came in and were seated immediately. We asked the hostess why they walked right in to which they replied, ""they are friends with the owners"". Well isn't that nice! So sh*t on the people who have been waiting an hour who were told ""20 minutes""..Finally, we were seated. Seated next to us was a group of old biddies who were also ""friends of the owner"", they walked in 20 minutes after us but had their food before us. Again, we placed our orders before theirs. Oh, that's right. We didn't. The waiter took their orders while we waited together in the lobby to be seated. How f*ckn RUDE!!!! Wrong food was brought to our table. Complementary dessert given. $141 bill later..not worth it. Should of grabbed a square and called it a night!",10/24/2016,250,238,1281,cdDnhPsk5Yws9qa7q2D8cA

398,Ilana Z.,0,4,"Went here for dinner after an afternoon on the beach. It's a bit far but I do think it was worth it. L&B has that old school Italian American vibe and is a good place for both a quick bite to eat and a sit down meal. The restaurant is split into three sections: there's a pizza window and outdoor sit-down area, an indoor Italian takeout with mostly the same menu as the sit-down but slightly different prices, and finally the sit-down restaurant. We decided on the sit-down and it was a busy Friday night rush but they seated us right away. Atmosphere was great, felt very family style. The servers were busy but friendly and seemed to know a lot of the frequent customers. Coming here did sort of feel like we were in a scene from a movie and my boyfriend and I joked about what we would say if the Godfather approached us. As for the food, we ordered a Sicilian slice ($2.75) because we were told that was the speciality, an eggplant parm pasta dish (~$15), fried calamari (~$14), and homemade spumoni (~$4). The pizza was, as expected, the best part of the meal. As a born and bred New Yorker I LOVE pizza but I've never been a huge fan of Sicilian slices. They've never made sense to me, all dough not enough cheese and sauce. This slice changed my mind. The generous amount t of mozzarella was hidden under a perfect amount of sauce and topped with parmesan, which added that nice extra salty bite. The dough itself was delicious and perfectly chewy and the crust, which even in the best slice tends to be bland, was super flavorful with a surprisingly delicious bitterness from the burnt edges. Overall, a perfect pizza experience. The calamari was also delicious and they gave us an extremely generous portion that could have easily fed a group of 4. I suppose that accounts for the price but in my mind the calamari wasn't anything special and was a bit pricey. The eggplant pasta dish was also perfectly cooked. This place certainly does al dente right and I think the pasta was the best part of the dish. The eggplant and sauce and extra cheesey cheese were nothing to scoff at either though. For dessert we figured we needed to get the homemade spumoni (after all it's the namesake) and it didn't disappoint. I'm still not entirely sure what the flavors are supposed to be but it was like creamy Italian ices and again they gave us a very generous portion. Overall, I would definitely go back and recommend to others even though it's way out in Brooklyn. But next time I think I'll skip the sit-down and just go for a slice of that amazing Sicilian pizza.",9/23/2017,221,7,5,MJpNzHTyTizXCUpADeZ5Pw

408,Ray K.,0,4,"3.8Drove out of the way to check this place out because of all the hype. We stopped in on an early Saturday afternoon on the ""Pizza Only"" side which we were pleasantly surprised to see since we didn't really feel like having a long sit-down meal.  Handful of tables and quite chilly on the inside, keep your jacket on. If you're only coming in for a quick slice I guess it works but if you're splitting a pie I can see it getting cold quick.Ordered a couple slices of the Sicilian and wow, the sauce definitely stands out. Perfect ratio of cheese to sauce and very flavorful. The only down-side was that I didn't know we were being served semi-warm/cold slices (if I had I would've requested them to be reheated but isn't that the norm when ordering by the slice??). Now if it had been properly reheated I can only imagine how much better the slice would've been (hello coveted 5 star?!?) but oh well, lesson learned.If I ever make it back to the area I would definitely give the joint another visit and get my slice reheated (or just order the whole pie)!!!",12/18/2018Previous review,5,116,92,D6DMG0bhcM2gFGY8P40_fQ

410,Melody C.,1,4,This is my go-to Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. Their portions are huge and really worth the price. I usually get the carbonara pasta to share!

Everyone I know raves about their square pie but it's not mind blowing amazing to me. But do try their Spumoni ice cream!! This place is perfect for big groups because of the huge portions.

Don't get me wrong it wasn't horrible but just okay. Another pizza joint in NYC. Pro: I love the nostalgia of this place. Old school, old folks and locals. That I love. It looked like it probably did years ago and yet still looked updated. The place is busy, servings are generous. I mean, that monster dessert platter?! Even our large group ( many of them foodies and food lovers in general) couldn't finish it. Service was awesome. Despite the busy-ness and it was only a Tuesday, we got our stuff promptly. Despite, the waiter missing an order. The white wine was generous and overall not expensive.Cons: AC. Pizza and wine means sweat and bloat for me. And in the middle of summer I was a pile of nasty sweaty funk. And trust me it wasn't only me. The food was okay-and yes, we ordered the Sicilian. It was just regular pizza, everyone rants about the sauce. I just thought it was okay, a little sweet for me. And the crust was a little too malleable.Overall? I'm all about going to strong still standing businesses and perhaps it was an off day. This place, after all is mentioned on varies blogs for its pizza.

Normally, this is the part of my Yelp reviews that delve into finer detail but L&B is like meeting 'the one'...it's love, and if anyone asked you to describe it, you just couldn't.

Our appetizers were great - calamari, baked clams, shrimp cocktail, mozzarella in corrozza, and mussels in a white wine sauce. For my main course I had the chicken sorrento and the penne alla vodka. The chicken sorrento is the perfect mixture of chicken parmigiana and eggplant parmigiana with prosciutto added to it. I love it. And I loved the penne alla vodka. Their vodka sauce is killer. For dessert we all shared the HUGE birthday cake ice cream platter they brought out for my brother.

I asked for mine with marinara sauce.  Very satisfying.If you are looking for fine dining, impeccable service, and beautiful surroundings,  look elsewhere, but if all you want is a great example of Italian American fare, give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.  And the price is right.",8/18/2017Updated review,61,110,63,0Ilqs2QDFE4PgCidhMch8w

I usually eat about 4 or 5 slices in one shot because I just can't get over how yummy it is.The dough is always so fluffy and soft with just the right amount cheese and sauce. And speaking of sauce, I don't know what amazingness they put into the sauce but it is delicious!Just a tip if you're getting a couple of slices it is cheaper in the long run if you get a pie.I love the atmosphere here all year long. There are outdoor picnic style tables which are so nice for summer nights and in the winter you can sit inside and be toasty and still enjoy it. I also love that when you pull up to the place there are cars double parked and families all around it just has a unique vibe to it. A happy vibe.Oh, and did I mention the spumoni???

428,Mel T.,1,3,"In all my years living in Brooklyn, I have never tried L&B Spumoni Gardens. One August Saturday afternoon, I finally got the chance to.Short story - a bit over-hypedLong story - they only have outdoor seating available (at least for the summertime during lunch hours). You order your food, and bring it to a table, like any other pizzeria. I'm glad that we decided to call ahead for pick-up, and then eat it there, which is probably the best option (I ordered about 15 minutes ahead and it was still piping hot when we ate it). So I can't speak for how long a pie would take but if you want to buy individual slices, I'm pretty sure they crank them out pretty quickly. Now, I'm not normally a fan of Sicilian slices but when I do eat them, I prefer them on the doughier side, and L&B definitely delivers on this. But it was definitely only okay. I wasn't wowed by it. It didn't live up to my expectations and all the great things I've been hearing about L&B.The true winner was actually the spumoni. It's a mix of pistachio, chocolate, and almond (?). If I were to come back, it will be for the spumoni, not the pizza.",8/29/2017,457,1370,3440,hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ

433,Ahmed M.,1,4,I heard soo much about this place so me and a friend drive by.  We were hungry and in the neighborhood so it was perfect timing.  They have outdoor seating and indoor restaurant.  I took the outdoor seating. I went to the counter - asked for two square slices - they put two on my plate and it was hot! The slices have sauce on top like Chicago style slices - it's very good.  I went back and ordered a center slice. I like how you can order which part you want and they give it to you no questions.  Service is good and fast.  I like fast no nonsense service. The only thing I had a problem with was that I felt the slices could have more cheese.  Needs to be cheesier.  I will come back and I'll try more food.,1/8/2019,234,249,373,UVmwu6mHwb5gZxGPhFVknw

However, service has definitely decreased as of late. Guys could be a little rude sometimes. Once brought a friend who had never been to l&b, so she had asked them a few questions about the pizza, and they acted like ""you should already know this."" Anyway, some people say the recipes have changed... to me it's still the same as it always was and that's : Delish!",8/14/2016,2,44,13,p6e7B33T4Ap9vmD3w047jQ

The sauce is perfect, the dough is finely baked; have not disappoint since the first time, so this will not be last.

The sauce is heavy  n balanced. I felt like the pizza can be divided by three layers - sauce, dense cheese n light chewy crust.remember I said emily's pizza is good? This is better!!Price: the best part of L&b is cuz it's cheap. 2.75 for a slice..you just cannot resist to come here.6 stars!!

437,Thomas V.,0,5,"Why is L&B Spumoni a 5 star rating?  It's not the best margarita square in the city (that would be Prince Street).  Certainly not a life changing experience.  However, by my criteria below - is it worth its own trip, is it something you will crave, something you'd pay full price for again? - it meets the standard.The margarita square is tasty, well baked, enjoyable where you'd want to eat more and more of it.  It's the other things that make L&B Spumoni a good experience.  Sure it's a bit of a trek to get to in deep Brooklyn, not far from Coney Island.  But when you get there, you know you're in Brooklyn.  You can hear the accent in everyone's voice.  It's the accent you think you'd hear if you were visiting NY (you know, from movies like Ghostbusters, Die Hard with a Vengence, Harry Met Sally, etc), but sadly hardly exists now in Manhattan.  There's a great almost gimicky ice cream place right next door, also classic NY/Brooklyn.  The staff there have always been great to me, always attentive and friendly.  Don't know what to say, such a pleasant experience being there.I don't know if I'd recommend this place to visitors over some of the other pizza joints like Julianas or Di Faras, but if you go I don't think you'd be disappointed.FYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other pizza joints in NYC5=worth a trip, something you'll crave4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space1=the place should shut downThe places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e. Di Faras better than Julianas, etc.)5's (whole pie) - Di Faras, Juliana's, Keste, Emily, L & B Spumoni5's (by the slice) - Artichoke, Prince St, Joes4's (whole pie) - Don Antonio, Robertas, Barboncino, Table 87, Lombaris, Patsys Pizzeria, Speedy Romeo4's (by the slice) - Roma's, Go 99, Two Brothers3's - Numero 28, Johns Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, B Side2's -Two Boots Pizza, Lucalis1's - none so far",8/7/2016,79,73,40,yw2cJk_SfGZlcoZKEUevxw

I got peach Italian ice with soft serve vanilla on top in a bowl. Too good. And the pizza did not disappoint one bit. There's a small lot to park but plenty of street parking.

I dined in recently and ordered their baked clams -- the quality was terrible. Aside from the quality being terrible, my brother and I got sick the day after and the only thing we shared in common was the baked clams.

450,Trent T.,1,5,"I have traveled far and wide for good pizza so I figured tonight I would venture into the depths of Brooklyn for a critically acclaimed Sicilian pie.I am so glad I did and I would also like to place my true rating at a 4.5 stars.This little gem was chaotic on an early Saturday night and I understand why now. It only took us about 15 minutes to be sat and we were greeted within minutes to get our order. Started off with rice balls, seafood salad, and the cold antipasto. The rice balls were absolutely delicious, I come from a predominantly Italian area and these were top notch. The cold antipasto was a nice variation of the dish, had a couple dry cheeses along with cold cuts and some unbelievable chunks of their artichoke. Finally the seafood salad was great it was packed with shrimp, scungili and mussels .. I just found it to be a little bland and lacking something I couldn't pinpoint it.Next, the pizza . Wow just wow. Great thick crust, crunchy on the bottom and soft and moist on top. Everything came together so well on it, words really can't describe. Finished the evening with the trademark Spumoni ice cream. It was a light almost like an ice texture but it was great. The flavors all came together really well and the pieces of pistachio brought it to the next level.If you really enjoy a great pizza and don't mind taking the trip, I highly recommend this spot.",11/26/2016Updated review,55,201,468,No1a5ujVTjbuOiJCFOhbrg
451,Jeff P.,0,5,"Walking 25 minutes to get here with my wife and 4 month old, I remember wondering: ""Is this pizza really going to be worth the trip?"" Yes.  Yes, it is.In a city with great pizza on every street corner, L&B Spumoni Garden's pizza hits a home run.The place is 3 buildings: an ice cream parlor, a pizzeria, and a restaurant.  We waited about 5 minutes to be seated even though it was busy and we had a massive stroller.We ordered mozzarella sticks, the half sheet Sicilian pizza, and soda.  The mozzarella sticks came quickly and tasted great.  My wife didn't care for the breading style, but they went well with the homemade sticks and to-die-for salsa.  The pizza was also fast too!  To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I saw it.  It doesn't look like anything special.  Then, I bit into a slice.  AMAZING!  The crust is bread-like without being too thick.  The cheese and pepperoni have the perfect ratio.  The sauce has magic mixed in is the only explanation I can think of.  Add a dash of parmesan cheese from the bowl they bring and you will be back.We returned again with 3 friends.  Same experience.  Pizza is a little more expensive than a corner store.  We paid about $40 for the two of us, but it was worth every cent!Go here is you want great pizza.  Go somewhere else if you want cheap pizza and lifelong regret.",10/22/2016Previous review,26,14,4,LmlpNLd5xVzdPKVPy5yr9A

My dad requested to grab dinner here for Father's Day. I can't believe that even my dad came here before I did! Sicilian Pizza. This place is well known for their red sauce topped Sicilian pizza. Fresh mozzarella is baked into the pizza dough then top with their delicious sauce. Their special red sauce is not your average tomato sauce. To me, the sauce is more on sweeter side than regular sauces I had before. It was delicious! Fried Calamari was probably one of the best versions I ever had! It smelled so good and so fresh from afar that our mouths were watering. Each piece was crispy and crunchy. This is quality calamari! We got the spicy option for the sauce but it was not spicy as I expected to be.  Definitely get it! Clam Linguine with White Sauce, this is my family's favorite pasta dish. L&B does an amazing job with it! It is not overly oily. Pasta was cooked perfectly for our taste - not too soft and still chewy. It was topped with fresh clams, garlic, and parsley. It was so good that we even dip our bread into the finish off the remaining sauce. Delicious!   5 Stars food experience all the way! I can't wait come back! And...

I went with my parents, brother and 17 year old son. My father ordered the Lasagna, my brother and son ordered a Sicilian pie, my mother and I split a Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato & Basil salad because we were going to be ""good"".  When the Sicilian pie came out my mother and I had to taste it, (because HELLO! Who can come and not at least taste).  Two slices (each) later, we had no regrets!  I can't even describe how good the pie was.  The sauce was incredible, just like their portion sizes.My father had the largest slice of lasagna in his 69 years.  He (who is one of the most persnickety diners ever) loved it.  He wanted to finish it, but he had to pack half to go he was so stuffed. Still, calories and guilt thrown to the wind, we were all in for dessert.  My brother got the Spumoni, I got Tiramisu ice cream, my son got chocolate chip Italian Ice, my mother got the Tarfuto; I'm proud to say I tasted EVERY LAST ONE (actually, we all did -including my father).  Everything was delicious.Our server was attentive and quick.

465,Josh G.,1,5,"You'll never try every pizza place in the state of New York. But you really don't have to, as there are plenty of classic and essential ones, such as this incredible dining option, that will leave you wanting it over and over again. L&B has been nestled in Gravesend, Brooklyn for over 75 years and last night I took my first trip there (and definitely not my last!). It was unfortunate timing with one of the owners having been fatally lost only days prior, but that didn't stop the droves of people coming out on a summer evening for some quality pizza and dessert. Summer months seem to be key as the set up is like some pizza Garden of Eden. Enter the gates and to your right are rows of outdoor tables as well as the indoor restaurant section. Straight ahead are your two windows of choosing: Pizzeria and Spumoni. Starting off with pizza you can choose a regular triangle slice, but the real amazingness comes from the Sicilian style pizza. It's somewhat upside down as the cheese is layered on first, followed by the sauce, and then a sprinkle of pecorino Romano to top it off. Get a single slice for dirt cheap, or go for a half or full pie's worth depending on how many people you're with. I came with two others so we feared a 12 slice half pie and instead went with three slices each (a perfect amount in the end). The pizza was ready in a heartbeat and I feel like it was gone by my very next one. Oh pizza gods you have bestowed L&B with some truly amazing pizza. The bottom/crust of the Sicilian slice is crunchy while the dough has a wonderful softness to it. The mozzarella cheese was gooey and melted to perfection, but what takes the cake (or pie) is the sweet sauce and the sprinkle of Romano cheese on top. It brings the slice altogether for some pizza that is worthy of moving to Brooklyn so you can experience it daily. But wait! There's more! Spumoni! Ordered from the window with the same name as the treat, this frozen delight can be devoured in one of three flavors (vanilla, chocolate, or pistachio) or an odd-colored rainbow of all three. I didn't properly do my ""homework"" as we only ordered a straight vanilla (rainbow seemed like the way to go around us) but even so, the taste was creamy with bits of nuts and a hint of what seemed like cinnamon. It was a meal that I will be dreaming about until I return, which if you haven't figured out, is going to happen for sure!",7/3/2016,346,632,6857,aGDtObhCNrySrrT2qpljfA

Lower East Side all the way, baby!!! The plain slices weren't any better.  It was like a slice you can find in any small Italian pizzeria.  But now where they really fell short was their house salad.  I took the grilled chicken salad to go; the guy must've felt super generous that day because there must've been a cup of oily dressing in my salad.  It was literally pooling at the bottom of the container ready to give me a massive heart attack.  To make matters worse, the oil couldn't help but spill all over inside the bag during the commute.  What a disgusting mess!!! It was no wonder all the dogs were trying to attack me!! They were so hangggry!!!!

479,David D.,1,5,"I have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for L&B Spumoni Gardens pizza--it really reminds me of my time on the East Coast.  Every time I ate here, it was with cool people who I no longer see that often.  The pizza was controversial amongst my pizza-loving brethren; some people just do not like thick Sicilian style pizza while others have come to love it as much as I do.  From my angle, this is in the top 5 pizza places of all time.  You really have not had Sicilian style pizza until you have tried this. Much has been said about the pizza here. Pizza-pretenders have tried to replicate their unique square pie without much success.   The most notorious thing is that they first place the cheese on top of the dough and then sauce on top of that--then finish with a dusting of pecorino.  The sauce is sweet and tangy, and, coupled with the somehow chewy and crispy crust, makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I cropped in close on some photos to give the curious a closer look.   If you don't believe my take on it, the sauce was rumored to be the subject of mob interest (see goo.gl/kMb0w ); it's that good.  The setting itself is in an older Brooklyn neighborhood and you will most likely be walking from a subway to get here.  You will find more people lining up outside getting slices to-go than waiting for the dining room.  Unlike another notorious Brooklyn pizza establishment, (I'm glaring at you Di Fara), you will not wait 3 hours to get your heavenly pizza pie.  If all else fails, you can get a slice to go and eat at their numerous picnic tables outside.  A slice is 2.50$, half-tray 20.00$, and full-tray 38.00$. Toppings for whole pizzas are like 4 bucks each.  I cannot wait to return.",5/18/2016,2121,266,1374,P6OBUNnwvMqRr3dFwjDHTQ

485,Subashis P.,1,5,"The one and only, Spumoni Gardens. Can you ever go wrong with a classic Spumoni slice, it's designed more like a grandma slice where the tomato sauce is on top of the cheese, prevents the bread from getting too soggy. It is just downright delicious, leaves you craving for a couple of more slices. The slices themselves a kind of small, so you would need a couple to be full. Top it off with the spumoni ice and you're set. Be warned however that the edges of the Sicilian pie tends to be burnt, so I would avoid those if you can.

( Pronounced Mahh Doughn... capiche? ) Just the drive down 86th street is amazing.  We wrapped up a shoot fairly close by this fabled pizzeria and I thought it would be a nice treat to take the boys over to L & B Spumoni Gardens for the world famous Sicilian Square pizza.  The joint was live to say the least, people ordering slices, full pies, squares, you name it!  The outside benches were full, it was awesome to see.  Old people, teenagers on dates, it was like a scene outta Grease.  We got a table inside (it looks like it was renovated in 86, lots of marble) and ordered a 1/2 Sheet of the Sicilian, a baked clams ( it's a Brooklyn Italian thing, you gotta have a baked clams) and linguini fruitta di mare.  The pizza just ok, very filling, the dough/crust was alright, the sauce good, I was completely puzzled.  This is not great pizza. the Sicilian at Ben's in Soho and the square on Prince street are way better. The baked clams are just not that good, ditto for the other thing.  This is a walk down memory lane, get a few beers, get the Sicilian, get an ice cream.  You'll be happy you did.",8/27/2016,278,119,93,rgkdB72VR3-o_xFbFUn9EQ

What I liked most was that we got to eat almost immediately. They have tons of pies available to purchases slices, so that's what we did. I was told you go to L&B for the square pizza. So I got 2 slices. My friend got the triangle. I did try a bite of hers but didn't think it to be anything spectacular. The square pizza... thick and saucy. Maybe too saucy. I typically love lots of sauce, but L&B's sauce was a tad on the sweet side. And there wasn't enough cheese on top, so the cheese/sauce ratio was completely off. After we finished our pizza, we each ordered Spumoni. Um. I've definitely had better. It was too ""icy"" and not creamy enough. Meh.",6/10/2016,81,116,270,pw3ncKQKog33bCnwFopvGw

Even thought it was packed we got a table pretty quick only perk.Long story short the table next to us knew owners and so obviously they got special service which isn't issue but again as a paying customer I would like some acknowledgement from my server I asked for more water I never got it...little things that like that really add up because around the time I asked for it , it was dying down.He left the check and then took a super long time to come back like I get it you are so busy but a little acknowledgment goes a long way..The carbonaro used to be my favorite dish it def tasted like the noodles were undercooked and the sauce tasted pretty watered down.Over hyped and disappointing.",4/14/2017,505,286,153,wU9ykgSWO0f3QMW83n3Y9Q

509,Charles B.,0,5,"When in BK ""Brooklyn"" as they say do what the natives ""Brooklynites"" do.....go to L& B Spumoni GardensThey're are many great Pizzerias in Brooklyn, each know for thier own unique specialties and nuances....Some roll out thier pie doughs with empty wine bottles, some proof thier pizza dough for 2 days, some are thin crust others thick...you know how that goes....as I like to say, ""different strokes for different folks""... So this leads me to L&B Spumoni Gardens..Their Sicilian Pizza is well worth the wait on line..They proof the dough and stretch it out in a oiled (EVOO). For those of you who are not foodies, that stands for Extra Virgin Olive Oil. After it's stretched out, they put a little sprinkle of olive oil and proceed to create the Tomato Topped Treat...Unlike the traditional application of the tomato sauce topped with mozzarella, they reverse it which is really a twist...What makes this pizza a one of a kind is that their tomato sauce traps the mozzarella and makes the pizza dough a chewy moist slice of heaven. It is extremely flavorful and has a different texture because it is put together quite unconventionally. That being said....Once there and you take your first bite, be prepared to eat a few of those Bad Boys...It's almost like eating a Cheese Doodle ....you just can't have one.I suggest that after you have dined on the Pizza, walk over to the gelato and spumoni station right next door to the pizzeria and treat yourself to some Spumoni.....I personally like the Cremolatta (an almond gelato) or Lemon Ice. Make sure when you visit BK...you swing by L&B....For those of us that live here...Brooklyn... is quickly becoming the Food Epicenter of NYBuon Appetito...Ciao for now",11/7/2018,1,6,0,0vzP6oFM7-HjMsZtvDj9Ug

512,Roxanne G.,1,5,"If you're from NY, you know pizza. If you're from Brooklyn, you know L&B's and if you've never had it, you travel here to try it. Hands down the BEST Sicilian slice around (referred to as square slice in the pizzeria). The regular slice is good too, but the Sicilian slice here is life changing. Cooked to perfection: the dough is just right, the crust is perfectly crisp, the cheese to sauce ratio is superb. There's a take out pizzeria (where most folks go) and a restaurant. There's plenty of seating outside. You will find people eating here on the nicest of days and even in the winter. L&B Spumoni Gardens isn't called Spumoni Gardens for nothin! Be sure to try a Spumoni, my personal fav is the pistachio, but if you're a first timer get a rainbow. The rainbow spumoni is made up of cremolata, chocolate and pistachio. The cremolata is vanilla with almond and cinnamon flavors in it; very cannoli cream tasting. The Spumoni is lighter than ice cream and gelato, but still a refreshing and delicious sweet treat. If you come to L&Bs and don't get a Spumoni, did you go to L&Bs?! Fuggghaboutit",11/5/2018,382,96,214,OmXpyQ1R_P6pDd9Dl0_Mog

521,Sarah B.,0,4,"As a kid growing up in a Brooklyn we got pizza nearly once a week, but going to Spumoni's was a special treat, and it is still amazing when I get to go today! Of course get the square slice and a rainbow spumoni. A square pie with 12 slices cost $24 dollars, and totally hit the spot for me, 4 of my siblings, and two of our boos the other day. As you have probably gathered by now, L & B puts their sauce on top of the cheese (I think some people call this grandma style pizza, I've always know it as an L & B slice). I love this because I'm a huge fan of a good saucy pizza and a pet peeve of mine is when the cheese gets cold and stiff too quickly (this won't happen with their square slice).The bathroom is in a weird and somewhat off putting location (need to go around the back of the joint). The place does get packed, but generally people are in and out pretty quickly. We have always sat outside, though it's worth popping inside to see the photos on the wall of the Sopranos, etc. Speaking of the mafia, it has always been my assumption the owners are involved (disclaimer: this is an assumption). As a kid when I asked why we couldn't go here every pizza night being that it was unanimously the family favorite, my parents always said it was because the owners ""did mean things."" One of the owners was sadly recently shot in his backyard, and the deets are a little fuzzy.

Here we started with the calamari, this was light and flaky (unfortunately light on flavor) which ACTUALLY became complete with the marinara(don't be afraid to throw a little lemon in that too). The arugula salad we had, amazing, a bundle of the biggest arugula I've ever seen tossed in balsamic and topped with tomatoes onions and garlic. The pepper, the spice, the crunch of those vegetables with the vinegar zing, perfect.Entree wise, we went with the chicken parmigiana and shrimp fra diavolo, wow. He handed the seafood dish to me and the mountain of mussels that came my way, you're lucky I caught a pic because I was digging right in. I was tearing through shells for meat, the shrimp large and succulent I didn't worry about those (thanks), I hardly noticed there were clams too. The linguine rested in the sauce, every bite was sweet and tangy.  The chicken parm, for two people, it had to be, one person to conquer that serving? Share with friends for sure. It may sound weird, but I I am not a chicken parmer like that, I know it's a go to for most, but this was made perfectly.   The techniques used, flavors that came together fluent throughout the entire meal, I only regret being too full for dessert(they really don't play with dessert, entire candy lands were passed to children).It doesn't matter tho, returning here a must.

526,Dona F.,1,5,I have been having pizza (squares to be exact) here for at least 40 years and I'm finally reviewing!!!I don't live nearby anymore but still come a few times a year. In my opinion a few squares finished with a Spumoni is still one of the most satisfying things to eat. I know people say it's not the same but I think it's still amazing. It's all about the sauce. Always eat when piping hot! Crunchy crust. I'm starting to crave again just from writing about it. I always take out of of towners here. Came here at 11:30 AM yesterday and the place was mobbed already!!!,8/3/2016,31,248,775,rMgKJHpA0kyU8fUk-Ef0NQ

536,Mary G.,0,4,"Cons: where is the bathroom? I don't know. It's hidden and if you aren't seated in the restaurant you can't get to it.Pros: damn this saucy gooey bready pizza was amazing. Not even in the same league as normal pizza, and not comparable, as it is not thin crust.  Don't come here expecting that. I had 1 slice and it was A LOT, but my boyfriend and I also split chicken parm entree and calamari. I'd suggest going that route -- getting a slice and then some entrees/apps, because the pizza is so heavy that you may not be able to eat more than 1 slice anyway.waitstaff was attentive and didn't rush us, despite the long wait.that said, i'd love to, and am looking forward to, ordering a big ol' pie for a party soon.",1/13/2018,206,13,0,L_NILAQ9Y9cobvMe2oVQLg
537,Jeremy K.,1,5,"Ventured out to the Gravesend section of Brooklyn for a authentic Sicilian Pie. I had heard about this place on tv and from a friend of mine, and I am so glad that I went there. The slices were amazing, and cooked to perfection. To top it off, since I was at L&B's Spumoni Gardens, I had to have some spumoni. It was as good as the pizza. As for the prices, not bad at all. A slice was $2.75 apiece and the spumoni was $3.75. In all, I spent $13.50 in total. Definitely would go there again, and highly recommend it as well.",7/14/2017,228,282,145,q5fK4JndTw_ip-qbjxxHkQ

539,Irina K.,0,4,"I can only speak for the pizza. I got a square pie from here a couple of times, it is good, but I won't say that it is the best I have ever had. I like the sauce that they use, and that there is not so much cheese, but it seems to me that the pizza is a bit undercooked? Not sure if that is how it is supposed to be. If you get a regular pie, they have a bunch pre-made, probably because they are quick to sell out. If you are in a rush, you might have to wait in line for a bit, but you will get your pizza quickly. Haven't seen the inside, but there is plenty of seating outside. I have yet to try the famous Spumoni.",10/14/2018,0,18,11,3SkqywSjGYiLgFKmY7CInA
540,Patrick J.,0,3,"Yeah. So, people have been raving to me about this place since I was a kid. Growing up in Bklyn as I did, it was never hard to find good pizza. You didn't need to leave the area to come across some exceptional slice. But as the landscape shifts and places come and go, L&B's stays true and remains a solid place in the community. I can only speak of their pizza, which is okay. It has never knocked me off my feet, but I've had better in many other places. Maybe because so many people blew it up in my head with their rants about how great it was. I found it to be good. Solid, certainly not exceptional.",2/13/2019,0,19,0,1Se4UyJD2yH4DYSS386jMA
541,Edward M.,1,5,"By far, one of, if not the, best Sicilian slice in Brooklyn - or in New York for that matter. Their pizza is legendary for the sauce right over the melty cheese, on top of a hearty doughy slice. The summertime is best for the pizza, as you can sit outside and enjoy the warm weather with  a slice and a soda.Also, a meal at L&B is not complete until you get an original scoop of Spumoni or Italian Ices.

And I gotta say, I was not disappointed.L&Bs pizza shape is rectangular where they have more crust usage than a circular shaped pizzas. Their crust and the pizza itself is almost if not more as thick than the Artichoke pizza. The pizza seems to have a generous amount of tomato sauce and cheese with very fluffy buttered bread texture.

You know my fat A$$ was happy to finish hers. It was good too but i prefer the coconut . Sorry had a few drinks prior to coming forgot to take a pic of the ices.

Recently shared the amazing pizza with my co-workers in the city. I was stopped in the street, on the elevator and by other departments making ridiculous offers in exchange for slices.

561,Jando S.,1,4,"Brooklyn's reputation as the borough of legendary NYC pizza is completely valid; among the many pizzeria institutions it represents perhaps no place comes close for Sicilian style pizza than L&B Spumoni Gardens. Buried deep in the southern part of the borough, Spumoni Gardens (I've never heard many locals ever refer to it as ""L&B"") can feel like a trek for non-locals but I would do it anytime I'm craving Sicilian. After all distance is all relative with patience and an appetite, right? Anyone with a car should zip over here immediately, barring BK traffic in mind of course.At roughly $21 a pie and $2.25 a slice, the price is a relatively a bargain next to a lot of other (vastly) inferior pizza joints that charge over $25 for grandma versions of Sicilian pies. These squares are chunky to the core, cheesy as it gets, and incredibly messy to eat. Unless you're strolling by for the occasional bite, this pizza should always be shared in good company or bought in bulk.Unlike most pizzas, I would venture L&B is better off eaten fresh on the spot, rather than the next day's leftover-in-the-fridge kind of the pizza. The crust loses its edge, the bottom becomes saturated in the grease / sauce, and it becomes a soft pudge of pizza goo before it congealing to a room temperature brick. Some folks might like it this way, but for maximum pizza pleasure I suggest eating it on the spot.And of course, there are other things besides pizza they do quite well. During the summer, this is a popular spot with locals for Italian flavored ices. Other Italian specialities like arancini rice balls or linguine with clams are popular with the non-pizza eating crowd, along with the baked clams, broccoli rabe, and mussels. There are round pies as well, but they have little precedence over the square slices.Lastly, this place is huge. Parking lot, dining room, and a massive outdoor area as well. During good weather days, there could be a long line but I've seen the same even during cold nights. It is uber family friendly and a fun place to challenge one's appetite for a tasty carb loading session.",1/3/2016,2771,3567,17323,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ
562,Jason C.,1,5,"As far back I can remember - I've enjoyed the pizza here. I practically grew up on L&B's pizza. When coming to L&B- get ready for 2 things....A SQUARE SLICE & Some SPUMONI! Yes ladies & gentleman...it's referred to as a square slice & it's DELICIOUS. The way they put the sauce over the mozzarella then top it off with grated cheese...amazing! The square is a must, I've rarely seen people come here a regular slice. And by the way, it wasn't until I was in my adulthood where I started called the square slice/pizza ""Sicilian"". The restaurant offers an extensive menu of goodOld fashioned, home style Italian ""comfort food"" ! There is even counter where you can get the restaurant menu to-go. Just be careful, I think the pizzeria side & restaurant side are handled by different People. Just know which door your entering. Last but definitely not least- you gotta have the Spumoni!

565,Laura G.,1,2,"Ugh ! .. It's pretty evident that this place is basking in the glory from years ago... I'm so shocked that this places reputation is still carrying on... Must be bc these people have been coming here forever, you can tell it's that's type of place.. The place where they know people are already waiting 45 min to sit and the second this big dude with stains all over his shirt and smells walks in he gives everyone a handshake and sits with his party.. So gross ...I came here after dyker heights street lights, it was busy but the waiting time was based off of larger parties needing to be seated, luckily I was I was with one person, we sat pretty quick.. The place smells good but it's dirty.. I mean.. Pretty filthy... The floors, the table, just gross.. Anyway, I was starving so we woofed down two famous squares.. They sucked... The sauce was ok but it was like I was eating raw dough .. All chewy and spongy it was gross.. There are so many other BETTER pizza places... We're in friggin New York like cmon. Ordered this chicken dish with eggplant, prosciutto and mozz cheese.. Also, nothing special .. Side of rigatoni with pasta.. Just boring and the pasta was mushy.I was so grossed out I wanted to just get up and leave.. Which I was upset bc I really wanted the spumoni but physically couldn't stand to sit there another minute...This place has been around for a while and I'm sure if their spumoni was anything spectacular you would see it in the freezer section of your local food store just like other places do when they're actually successful with their gelato, sauce, etc. Older Italian women working in the front of the place are ratchet and rush you so don't expect a friendly greeting they only give a shit about getting you in and out and truthfully the food F-ckin sucked..

It's not like they make the pies undercooked all the time, its just protection against that happening. They are churning out so many pies it can happen once in a while. Who am I kidding? I would eat it anyway! They have coined their owned style. A lot of other pizza places sell an L&B style square pie but they never come close.It's like an inside-out pizza with crust, Moz, sauce, and pecorino Romano on top and infused in the crust. There are, however, some that do not like this style of Pizza. When I hear that claim, it makes me want to call you crazy and force my opinions on you as if they were the truth. But I don't because I'm trying to be a better person.Our cousins from Out of town wanted to have a NY Slice and we took them here. It was too much for them. They were not fans.

580,Steph A.,0,4,Ugh this is the spot to go to for the best squares in brooklyn!!!! I mean one of the best squares in Coney Island I shall correct myself bc the last few times I went the pies where a bit soggy an boring. I still wouldn't let that stop me from going back. Esp in the summer it's just a great place to sit an have a good lunch & grab a nice cherry Italian ice after. Parking sucks people usually double park or fight for a spot in the lot which is super tight. Over all you are in bklyn on a major Ave so that's expected. Definitely a go to spot if your in the area. Nice square pie yummy!!,1/3/2017,251,207,201,Qd9J3B9ipoGIGDJUdpVyxQ
581,Correy K.,1,3,The Squares and the Spumoni's are r good but I still feel that L& B is overrated. It's either you like it or you can tolerate it. I don't like raw dough with a sauce on top and a bit of cheese. To me it tastes like school lunch with ketchup. I have only dined at the outside area at the bench like chairs. It's a busy summer spot and opened late (12midnight). I really worry about the double parked cars and the parking lot that is always filled with people in a rush.ugh... the outside bathroom is not the best.,1/31/2017,169,147,38,S_1bWFZOix1xV2L39yN8ng
582,Krista C.,0,3,L & B's is like that boyfriend that you just can't seem to break-up with. You know in the end that he's going to let you down but every once in a while he does something right and you start to remember the good old days.I have been coming here from the time that my first tooth started coming in and it has definitely changed over the years. It seems that over time with changing of the owners the slices have gotten smaller and quality has gone down. On some days my slice is amazing while others it is undercooked. I just don't feel the love anymore. Their spumoni is still on point but that's about it. Unfortunately for me I'll still always come back  because I'm a sucker for nastolgic memories and trying to relive the better times with that boyfriend that will never go away.,11/23/2016,122,275,1316,Zg9051S1dPRhbVGvgbNurQ
583,Dmercedes S.,0,4,"Delicious pizza and other items sold here. Quick service. The only problem I have is with the seating for the pizza only section. The restaurant is really nice and you get full service there. However if you just want pizza, you have to sit outside. That's ok for the summer but what about other seasons. There's a tiny section for sitting inside but it gets full really quick since this place is so famous. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this place. You have to at least try it.",9/3/2018,0,12,7,pCTRJsx_OpQPPGwwUdmZKg

Starting in the left you have your pie orders, in the middle left you have you ice creams floats etc, middle right you have you quick order take out of anything and to the right you have your proper sit down dinner.We got the pies to go. Two large sheets one was with sausage. the other was just plain. So what did I think? I think it is a pretty dam good Sicilian pie. For a think crust not as heavy as you would think. My daughter and Wife wished it came with a side of sauce. Me and the boy thought it was just right. They maybe have 5 topping options. I myself would have preferred a couple more then that. The two large sheets cost about 50ish. If you asked me would u return. The owner is sure on a nice summer day I would take the bench's outside and get a pizza a broccoli rabe garlic side. The place is great place just a bit far for uesider. But when in the hood enjoy         Another day we did the sit down. Joey was our server. A sheet pie for the table because your life would be incomplete if you did not. A order of the seafood salad. Poseidon himself would find this alone a fulfilling meal and  An order of egg plant rollotini for the table as well.  I can say, if you're in the neighborhood forget about any other places and go here.",7/1/2018Updated review,51,149,66,atpTCCzuBzWGV52QjYpmYw

588,Hanisha P.,0,5,Went to L&B Spumoni last night with my fiancé. We were seated right away. You're able to order pizza slices in the dining room if you order other dishes otherwise have to pick up at the window next door for slices only. We sat in the dining room and ordered two Sicilian slices and the eggplant Sicilian. Sicilian slice was amazing. Wish we hadn't ordered the eggplant dish otherwise I would have easily ordered two more Sicilian slices. The dining room area was very home-y feeling and the service was great. It was packed for a Tuesday night yet the service didn't slack at all. We were attended to at the right times and were taken very well care of.

From baptisms to graduation and birthdays this place has always done justice for me. It legit feels like home. Matt is one of my favorite waiters he's always smiling and has a great personality. The food usually comes quick. Seafood salad is my fav except sometimes they don't have all the ingredients :( but you can't go wrong with fried calamari as a back up. I usually get chicken piccata for dinner because I'm a huge fan of lemon and garlic and it just works for me.

Tasted only a bit better than fast food beef with a can of Campbell's turkey gravy thrown on top.Hostess was an older woman in her 60s. Abrasive and rude. Server was okay though. What wasn't okay was the mold growing in the salt shaker. Couldn't believe that was even possible but Google confirmed it could.Stay away. Tourist trap.,10/26/2015,250,278,1560,bvt9YFDtBvJ4mq0QIhLJTw

604,Jay M.,1,3,"I was in the Bensonhurst area for lunch, and after seeing Spumoni's Yelp page with 2k+ reviews, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to see what all the hype is all about. Half-tray Sicilian ($21): The dough was soft and a bit chewy, with the fresh mozzarella they use adding a nice thick layer of cheesiness that blends well with the rich tomato sauce. It's topped with a little parmesan. Additional toppings are $2.75 each, but only paid $2 for half with pepperoni so my total was actually $23. Though this was the first time trying pizza here, I guess I'm with the purists in saying that the Sicilian slices taste so much better with no toppings. The pepperoni was good, but I did find it a bit too salty. I agree with another reviewer--it'll take at least two to three to fill you up.Large Spumoni ($3.50): That small translucent plastic cup is a LARGE!? Note to self: Order a pint or quart next time. I ordered the rainbow flavor (vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio mix) and absolutely loved it. There were actual bits of pistachio in the spumoni, which was pretty awesome. I was expecting this to be excessively sweet, but it was more of a subtle sweetness. The texture is lighter than their regular ice cream, which made eating it easier...and quicker (le sigh).The other dishes seem like typical pizzeria food, so I might just stick with the Sicilian and Spumoni. A bit overhyped, but I do think the grandma-style pies here are pretty good.",11/15/2015,143,818,2091,e1dYw-1Km6IAwXlOLIMAeg

At $2.25 a slice for either a Sicilian slice or a regular round pie slice, you really can't go wrong.You either have the option to take out, eat inside, or sit outside.

Perfect amount of tomato sauce. Price is ~$2.75 a slice which is the norm. There is outdoor seating which is nice for a summer night. Plus, there's a parking lot which is definitely a plus because we all know how much of a pain finding parking is. Their Spumoni ice is also very popular but I'm not a fan of it. My friend loves it though! I prefer the regular vanilla one but I guess I'm basic so don't mind me. Anyways, next door is an actual restaurant with authentic Italian food. It's also bomb!!

The (square ) pizza is the best in New YorkThe place hasn't changed in 100 years Is it really that long ? I think so.The Pizzeria is busy making phone orders for the busy neighborhood. You can get a pie in 20 minutes or so with a friendly counter person. This place is still like it was back in the seventies.Back to the restaurant here's usually a 39 minutes wait sometimes longer. The restaurant is reasonably priced. And I'm sure they could charge more and they still be crowded. The calamari is delicious and ordering and Half silcialian (square) and you can take home what ever you didn't finish For two I wouldn't order much more if you go with the pizza. It's so delicious you just can't have only one.

635,Li M. H.,0,5,"Come here for their Sicilian style pizza! It is soooo good!! A perk about New York is the pizza. And it's not just one or two places to choose from, but there are so many of them. The best part is that you can go to all these pizza spots and look for the one you think tastes the best. L & B Spumoni is a family owned business and have been around for many years. I've finally gotten the chance to travel to this place and have one of the best Sicilian slices I've ever tasted. Walking up to this place, they literally take up an entire block. Out front, you can order pizza and spumoni at two separate windows (Pizza window and spumoni window). There are many tables and chairs in the outdoor area to sit and eat. Through the doors on your right, they have a dine-in restaurant. Before the dining area of the restaurant, there's another section where you can walk up to order their restaurant food items.I highly recommend trying their Sicilian pizza! Just know that their pizza isn't your usual pizza, mainara sauce then cheese (in that exact order) kind of order. The cheese is under the marinara sauce, above the dough. Sauce is sweet but you can still taste the fresh marinara and the cheese is just the right amount. It's not very dough-y either. My boyfriend and I have dine at the restaurant to try some of their pasta. I had the lasagna and he ordered the linguini with clams in white wine sauce. And we order fried calamari to share as an appetizer. The lasagna was good. But my boyfriend didn't really like the linguini with clams. Their clams were chopped up. We've had this particular dish in other Italian restaurants and it just tastes so much better when it's the whole clam in shell. Calamari was good, the usual battered calamari with half a lemon and marinara sauce on te side. We also bought half a tray of Sicilian pizza to take home with us for his family to try.If you have space in your stomach after, try their spumoni! I've had their (soft serve) creamsicle on a cone: combination of orange sorbet and vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend tried their spumoni. It's a combination of vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio mixed.",10/14/2016,286,118,981,AXeS7cKHfvzifuK_VEKKog
636,Matt K.,0,4,"Another popular pizza place where I live. The squares are unique. The crust is crunchy, and the middle dough is very soft. The squares contain more sauce, than cheese. I've never tasted similar pizza elsewhere, so one again, a unique slice.The parking lot is small, and is usually over crowded. Cars are also double park in front. Parking can usually be found within 2 or 3 blocks though. Also accessible by getting off of the D train at 25th Avenue(couple of blocks away).Definitely worth visiting if you like pizza.",8/22/2017,20,30,3,4cJgDMZPh-g9SJ1XrvBbpQ

I will hit repeat on Lucali's, Grimaldi's, Di Fara's, Emily's, Roberta's and more, but I think L&B is a one and done kind of place. The sicilian is pretty good, but the undercooked dough in the middle is just not my thing. I am going to try and crisp up the leftovers in the oven to see if they taste better that way. We dined in and also had the calamari, which was light and crispy but otherwise tasteless and the house salad, which was better than most house salads.  I think the star of the meal was the rainbow spumoni, which we got from the takeaway window. I can see how this place might be good for a summer slice after the beach, but personally, I think it's not worth the trek.",4/2/2018,1,126,8,6ZB9V3QUccSdJVUSUDdpjg

644,Guillermo V.,0,4,"This is a Brooklyn Institution. I think far too often the term institution is miss used to refer to places that are very iconic but not institutions anymore. Places like Gramaldis have amazing food, critically acclaimed, long lines, pictures with celebrities but sometimes seem more like tourist sites than restaurant. L&B is different this is a neighborhood institution. I went there on a Friday at 9:30 and it was packed. There is a large outside area and as well a large inside area both parts were fairly full. I ordered pickup and there was even quite a few people waiting there. This is the kind of place where you see all kinds of people fromt he neighborhood teenagers with friends, young adults before parties, families with children, People celebrating birthdays. Anyone and everyone can come here. The pizza itself was pretty good too. I got a box of the square and man can that fill you up! The dough is more like a bread but it is well made. I got pepperoni and they did a good job of not putting too many. The cheese was also good. If you are comparing this place to Prince street (the other most famous square) its different. L&B crust is denser and more bread like. The pepperonis are more traditional not the small cups. However, that does not mean this is not a really delicious meal.",9/25/2017,172,93,20,1b7m9Mgxp0z8Qi3e6qqIDw

646,Pete L.,0,5,Let me start off by saying that I never get the Sicilian slice anywhere but my friends who know this place made me do it because they said that's their specialty. I was not disappointed. The slice was somehow soft and airy and also crispy at the same time. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and savory and there was a perfect coating of cheese. I was blown away to say the least.,6/26/2018,419,25,1,i2xVbxi9ZJL76EHXe78-lg

Try to get it when they just come out the oven. Their sausage and pepper sandwiches are pretty tasty too. Never sat inside, always grabbed a bite and sat in their spacious outdoor area. They have Italian ices too. Their spumoni flavor and pistachio are weird to me, not a fan but their cherry is the traditional Italian ice and super yum. Place gets busy so be prepared for double parked cars and a little wait time. Great spot after a beach outing.",6/9/2018,284,32,4,LSE3yeKgPBosZe_pEDh0ZA
648,Anthony H.,1,4,"Best pizza in Brooklyn from what I hear. I wouldn't know because I've only had pizza at this one place in Brooklyn. What I can say is that it was very very good. I enjoyed it quite a bit. They do the cheese under the sauce which was a new experience for me. I've never had it like that. We just got a cheese pie. I wanted pepperoni on it, but I was told by a friend that's a sin. Mama didn't raise no sinner. So when in Brooklyn... we get a Brooklyn style zaa. It was really good. I think it would of been killer with pepperoni but I'll never know. It's definitely a top notch pizza joint so hit it up. They have an ice cream place side by side that I'll try next time. It was I think $42 for 2 pretty massive rectangular pies. I thought it was very reasonably priced.",10/14/2016,137,232,344,nxRJAxVCj3SkHE8tMSLcMQ

659,Betsy G.,0,1,"My husband and I traveled from manhattan to try this place. We had read good reviews about it, but we were left scratching our heads as to why. We both got slices of the square pizza and shared a pear salad. The menu said the salad came with pine nuts but there were none on the salad. When I asked about it, I was told that they don't do that any more. Since the salad was mostly mixed greens with a little cheese, onion and pear, I don't understand how it can possibly be worth 11.99 without the nuts. Also, they should have mentioned this when we ordered and we would have chosen something else.We found the pizza to be quite mediocre, lots of bread, a little sauce and almost nonexistent cheese. This place is definitely not worth the effort to get there and we left as hungry as we came, only $20 lighter.",6/15/2018,10,7,11,_zXDBLAKYgwuifpDs5wjsA

661,Lianna T.,1,4,"We were headed out to Dyker Heights to see the annual Christmas lights and wanted an Italian meal beforehand. This restaurant was absolutely packed on a Tuesday night with huge groups - mostly families. Our waiter offered us the family style meal, which we declined but sounded like a feast that had enough food for about 30 (if I ever come back with that many people, it doesn't sound bad). Everyone seems to order the Sicilian pizza, big thick crust square pieces with a thick red sauce and smattering of cheese. We ordered that along with a few salads, pasta dishes, and heroes. While the food was good, it was not anything special. The highlight of the meal are the desserts which include any type of ice cream - soft serve, regular, ices, and spumonis. We tried the spumoni for fun and it wasn't bad! People may not come for the food, but for the communal, family, fun atmosphere (and possibly hefty portions).",12/30/2015,249,132,169,NtO49z_Rthb4uOdNrZTSew

666,Marina S.,1,4,"Solid spot for a Sicilian slice (say that 5 times fast). I probably won't come all the way out here for another one, but it's a great pizza option if you're in the area or on your way to Coney Island.Pro tips:+ Make sure you're in the right line. There are 2 windows- one for pies and one for just slices.+ Don't expect service to be nice. When they roar NEXT, make sure you have your order ready and your money out.+ Try to get a slice from a pie that's right out of the oven. It's seriously so much better that way. Also go for a slice in the middle rather than the edges for extra doughy goodness.+ If you have a group, go all in and get a half tray to save on costs AND get a fresh pie.Such was our learning experience. We got a few square slices, and they unfortunately weren't straight out of the oven, so the sauce was a bit dry and the dough was pretty undercooked in the middle. It was still really good. I'm a huge fan of crust and sauce and not so much with thick globs of cheese, so the Sicilian was perfect. We did try another slice that had just come out of the oven, and that one was sooo much better- more moist, albeit a little crispy on the edges. I still want more sauce though!Also make sure to end your meal with rainbow spumoni- it's super refreshing and not too heavy like regular ice cream. Just be prepared for the imminent sugar/carb crash later.",8/3/2015,391,378,960,_9oCJep59XMxiO0PdtCCmQ

672,David Z.,1,5,"I guess you can say I'm a romantic when it comes to yelp milestones, such as my 400th review. I did not want it to be some tawdry review of a street meat cart or dumpling storefront in the armpit of Chinatown, no, I wanted it to be special (like Dylan and Brenda at the Bel Age after the prom special).  As such, I have not posted anything in a long time, just waiting for a place worthy of the big 400.  Alas, on the 3rd day of my new low carb lifestyle, I thought what better time to drive out to brooklyn and try L&B's famous squares. Strangely enough, I first heard of L&B while living in Surfers Paradise Australia in 1997.  While there, I befriended a guy from Coney Island who would talk endlessly about his favorite pizza place called L&B.   When I returned stateside, for whatever reason, I never made it out there. Happy to report that the countless positive reviews on yelp are on target. This is not some hyped crap-house, no this place serves delicious squares that are worthy of acclaim. Pro tips: 1.  I think it is better to order by the slice, not a half a tray.  This way the pizza is fresh and still hot.2.  Go at a strange hour so there is no line, like during the week around 3ish. 3.  When I went during the week day I found street parking very easily (despite how it may look from the pictures, there is no parking lot for L&B). 4.  The slices are a decent size, not that big.  Some reviews say that the pizza was much better years ago.  I wonder if this is the case?  It would be fascinating to compare a slice from 1997 when my friend would rave about it, to a slice purchased today. Overall, well worth the drive out there.  I'm already craving more. Definitely worthy of 5 yelp stars.",7/25/2015,416,573,21,H43AWKCFTxj8OwVNvySciA

They have a separate window for ice cream, pizza, and then they have a restaurant indoors where you can order appetizers and pasta and such.My family and I ordered the half tray of the square slices and then we ordered an appetizer of calamari. The calamari is pretty spot on as the breading isn't chewy or soft, it has that perfect crunch you're looking for alongside with the tangy marinara sauce.Driving from queens to here is gonna be worth the drive every time.",11/8/2016,68,92,498,Crd3n4vD4iYu1mBnK08JOw

687,Fazeela S.,1,4,"Alert: Best time to go is 1) When HUNGRY and 2) in the summer. After 25 miles of biking last weekend, in 82 degree weather, with only a handful of almonds, a bottle of water and a small lemon ice in my stomach, I was sufficiently prepped to eat the thick Sicilian deep dish pizza that Spumoni Gardens is known for. Now, I'm no deep dish pizza fan. Once upon a time, I lived in Chicago for 3 years and tried each and every top-rated Chicago-Style deep dish pizza joint and I was never happy. I used to scrape out the insides because those deep crusts were gross. I think I may have left Chicago because I judged the city by it's crappy deep dish pizza. But Spumoni Gardens is in NEW YORK. The sauce on the Sicilian deep dish is zesty, flavorful and lovely. The way the cheese melts into the sauce and crust is seamless. The actual dough is chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside. The best part? If you sit outside at the picnic tables, there is no line. You just go to the counter and order. We had our slices within 5 minutes of entering! PLUS, when I went up for seconds, the pizza guy gave me an extra slice ""on the house"". Total score. (I did try a slice of the thin crust pizza, but couldn't finish it. Bland, boring, hardened cheese. DiFara is where you go for thin crust). I also sampled various homemade ice cream/gelato flavors (pistachio, tiramisu...) and just didn't like them. They were overly creamy and lacked flavor. But the lemonade was GREAT. Not too sweet and perfect for a hot day. The clientele at this Gravesend, BK, remind me of folks who go to Anderson's Frozen Custard in Buffalo OR the cast members of Real Housewives of New Jersey. This is not where hipster Brooklyn roams. It is where local (mainly Italian?) families go after baseball games. Spumoni Gardens serves up totally solid deep dish Sicilian pizza and sauce. It's not usually my thing and I don't foresee being a regular by any means. But on those RARE moments when I crave tons of chewy dough with zesty, homemade sauce served within minutes, I now know where to go.",8/6/2016,209,344,350,fi6TOsJIbbQjUrUVzzY-yg
688,Kirsten S.,0,5,"Everyone including me loves this BROOKLYN STAPLE. Nothing comes close. I enjoy t here only in summer because I need the whole experience of sitting outside, getting one slice at a time so it's always fresh from the oven, my Pepsi followed by a small Spumoni. It's a euphoric experience I keep to a minimum so I don't get tired of it. The pizza does have an expiration date in my opinion. I think it loses all its specialness once it leave the patio. The parking is bad but doable. The bathrooms are gross, don't use them. Last but not least, I love the sauce who didn't but it's never enough for me. I ask if I could pay extra for a little cup of sauce to add to my pizza but they refuse every time. I do understand it because they don't want people bringing it home to an Alize all it's ingredients and copy it. That's a real thing, many restaurants I've been to with signature dishes they will not allow you to eat with. I've only had one experience inside at the restaurant where we shared a large Sicilian and mozzarella en carozza. All tasty but it loses it charm once your not roughin it outside in the hot sun, shooing away bees.",6/16/2015,521,493,3228,I2xm1Zy9UZOWwaxPfnsksw
689,Saif B.,0,3,"Famous pizza place in Brooklyn. Known for their special sauce and their square slice. It's made different the cheese at the bottom and the sauce on top. The sauce is a secret ingredient, that's been in the family for generations. They even had fights over the sauce. Some people wanted the recipe for the famous sauce. L and B started getting threats. The square pizza is good and it's something different and also they hype about the sauce is what got it so famous. But the service is bad. There is two side to the restaurant. One side is for, quick sit in spot and the other side is fine dinning. I went to the quick sit in spot and the service was horrible. I'm standing there and people are randomly ordering. The workers don't even pay attention. It's really disorganized. Maybe the fine dinning area is different. But my experience there wasn't good. The pizza was good. Loved the sauce and the right texture of the pizza. Maybe they need to work on their service and also the sit in spot needs to be bigger. The place has outdoor seating. You can't seem to get a spot to sit. Specially when it's cold outside. POoR SeRVice!",7/19/2017,27,85,189,ZintKm1AB5nFYsj-nDlsmw

There are 2 kinds of people the end people who like the ends and corners, I'm a corner guy. There are the middle people, no crust I don't know about the middle people.

Lively atmosphere with very accommodating and enthusiastic servers. Love their chef's table, with plentiful platters of salads, apps, pastas, meats, and desserts.

700,Susan M.,0,5,L & B will always be one of my favorite pizzerias in Brooklyn. You can sit outside on a nice summer day or you can actually have a sit inside the restaurant. Majority of the time when I come with friends in the summer we get squares and some ice after. The squares aren't too thick and just right with lots of sauce and than some cheese sprinkled on top that just melts into the sauce and taste so good. The regular slice is just regular nothing special about them. I never usually get those. One of my favorite from the restaurant is there vodka sauce. It is so tasteful and good. Some places make it and it just taste so bland but there's is amazing and you can really taste the sauce. If you get it with pasta it's a big portion so if you don't eat a lot you can share it.Also I can't forget about there chicken parm. Hero. They give such big pieces of chicken that are so tender and with the sauce it just gives it such flavor. Than you also can't forget about the melted mozzarella on top to top it. It's also pretty big and filling.I have been coming here for years and will continue coming here.,7/13/2016,213,122,274,JkvBTZIbt2pWaXGm4cw4_A

Bread was stale or maybe from another table. Then everything comes out but the pizza.  By the time the pizza comes out the eggplant hero is cold.  And didn't even taste good.   Fettuccini is just ok. No refills of water or soda that was ordered.

I would also think that since I paid an extra 6 bucks for grilled chicken, that they would put more than a measly serving of it. The overall entree, however, is definitely enough for 3 people, maybe 4. We didn't realize the portions would be so large, so we ended up getting way more food than we needed!Also pretty big serving of calamari (about $14), definitely more than enough for 3-4 people. It was pretty bland though, which was disappointing.I also tried the pistachio spumoni - I have to admit, I wasn't sure if I liked it for the first few bites, but then it slowly started to grow on me.

Their menu is very old-world Italian (think Parmigiana, Rollatini's etc) It's a very typical NY-Italian menu that you could find in any pizza place, BUT, this this place does it really well.

708,Danny C.,1,5,"Straight up five stars. This place has some of the healers and best slices all around. Their classic square slices won't cost you more than $3, and they'll fill you up. I love how the dough is only about 3/4 cooked in the middle so that you get this great textural interplay between the crunchy bottom and soft top with plenty of great tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese. The circular slices are just as good and hold up excellently when it comes to the Brooklyn fold. It's $10 for credit cards as a minimum and you'll need it because you're going to want at least two of each type of slice. Finish it off with three scoops of spumoni in a cone for only $3.75, and you've got an amazingly unhealthy, but delicious meal. You might think of it as a tourist trap, but it's honestly worth a visit or ten. You'll thank me later.",1/22/2018,129,1555,590,jVaiCNmWOjoI0led5LZuyA
709,Ingrid A.,0,4,"Brooklyn Staple and my summer guilty pleasure whenever I'm coming back from the beach out on Long Island via the Belt Parkway. Growing up 1/2 of my life in Brooklyn I know the difference between ok pizza, good pizza, and AMAZINGGGGGGGG, My Tastebuds Will Suffer No Others PIZZA!!! Guess which one L&B's falls under? Now while a lot of Brooklyners flock to eat dinner or Spumoni's I go specifically for the Squares. I'm a middle Square kinda girl but I am not hatin on those of you out there in Yelp-Land that like the Edges.Best to eat fresh outta the oven (which isn't hard because no matter what time of the day you go, the window always has a line waiting for the next tray to come out pipping hot.) Some rules to Live By: - Since you are waiting for your Square anyway, get your money situation together. When you get your Square,...... aint no-body got time for you to sift through your wallet, change-purse, boo's man-purse or blackhole of a bag to get your money out. Get it TOGETHER.- Dont get mad when you can't find the toppings shakers. This is a Brooklyn community. Go to the next table and ask to have them. Like-wise don't be a toppings whore...... you are there,.......... now empty 1/2 of the cheese shaker onto your Square, SHARE and keep it moving.

713,Rosemary V.,1,4,"Tips: First, decide whether you're eating in or outdoors.If you're eating outdoors, go to the window that says: 1/2 Trays and full trays only. (Unless you're getting pizza by the slice, then proceed to that window). After you order, grab a sit and wait for the yumminess.If you're eating indoors, go inside and give your name to the hostess. If temperature is nice, go sit outside. They will call your name over the loudspeaker when your table is ready.If you're eating inside and with a large group, don't go there during the dinner rush, at least on weekends, otherwise you will wait. Square slices come in single slices, half a tray (12 slices) or full tray (24 slices). If you come with an appetite, expect to eat two slices per person (I had 3; yup I eat like a fat man!).On to the review: I went with five other people at 5:30pm and we only waited about 15 minutes for a table inside.Food: We ordered half a tray of the square slices as well as calamari, rice balls, and mozzarella sticks. The pizza was soo good and just so different than the other Sicilian slices I've had. The cheese is underneath the sauce making the slice soo fluffy. The taste is tangy with a touch of sweet. The corner slices are definitely the best. The Calamari was yummy as well as the rest of the appetizers. After we paid our bill, we got a small spumoni ice cream and it was sooo yummy. Even if you're stuffed from the pizza, have some ice cream, after all, how often will you go there?Ambiance: Place is very family friendly therefore you see people from all ages. Outside they have picnic tables; inside is small, yet comfortable. Depending on your taste, you'll see some Italian eye candy. Bathroom is kind of small.Service: Hostess was super friendly. Our waiter was nice although at one point we had to hunt him down for the bill.Prices are so cheap! This is a good place to go if you need to feed many mouths or if you're on a budget.This place is quite far from Harlem, so I can't say I'm rushing to go back. With that said if I'm ever in the area, I would definitely go back. I'm so glad I got to check this off my list.",10/1/2018,252,530,278,fjckdImR7BuOy7F0GjORzg
714,Krista M.,1,4,"Sicilian pie, not really my favorite, but my husband was obsessed with coming to try L&B so we finally made it.If you want pizza, there is outdoor seating available.  The indoor dining room is for a more hearty meal, like pasta, etc.  Back to outside, there are a few order windows.  One is to order by the slice, one is for full and half pies and the other is for spumoni and ice creams.I have to say their Sicilian slice is on a another level.  While it is thick, it is not doughy and heavy but light and crisp.  It is not inundated with cheese and sauce, but lightly coated, making for a delicious bite.  If they were in my neighborhood I'd be a regular.The spumoni is sort of like a creamy ice or an icy ice cream and their signature is a combo of vanilla, chocolate and pistachio.  It too was light and not too sweet.A great spot for pizza and something sweet.",6/23/2017,360,731,293,74Myfl8pOGeKcmkVTimsvg

We got the Sicilian half pan for three of us, expecting to have a lot left over. We did not have a lot left over...The sauce was perfectly tangy, a little bit sweet. Sauce to cheese ratio was just right. Didn't need to add salt or parm on top to get a good flavor. The dough was chewy and dense on the inside, with just barely a crunch around the edges and a nice char on the corners.Totally worth the hike and the hype.",5/12/2015,199,54,46,kX9cWvJTdQLdiwI7V6u17w

Cheese and sauce are good, but something about the dough took me back to lunch room pizza back in elementary school -- but obviously much much better. It was the dense doughy consistency, I think. I like the ones where the bottom is super crispy to the point where you hear every crunch and more bubbles in the dough to make it springy instead of dense. It was steaming hot and fresh from the oven though which is the ultimate pizza ideal.They're open super late, and service was quick and efficient.

Well, the Sicilian pie although very good did not send me over the moon. It did have many positives, such as great sauce, good cheesiness and a lighter than air crust. Again, why only 4 stars; because 4.5 is not an option. For the record, L & B has the BEST meatball parm. hero that I've have ever tasted. The bread, sauce and cheese were perfect accompaniments to the meatballs, which are absolutely heavenly. I kid you not, they're that good. Looking my forward to my next visit, which will be very soon.",10/9/2016,19,16,2,9Xe3P0wlDsiPPitkUXfkIw

739,Tracy K.,1,4,"Finally tried L & B Spumoni Gardens, one of NY's historical and unique Pizza places of yesteryear here today and even more popular.For years as a kid, we would stop off for Albert's Pizza (in Long Island), whose unique recipe appears to have come straight from here!  L & B began in the 1930s, and Alberts on LI in 1950s!  Lol..  maybe they are related or maybe Albert was a chef who came out here with L & B's recipe and became popular from it! Not sure.This  is fun pizza that is square, has a crispy light crunchy crust, cheese underneath a really saucy sauce, with some distinct flavor of oregano, and parmesian cheese sprinkled on top.So its not your classic Neopolitan, expect something different, and good.  They do have round, but people come here for the Sicilian sauce on top.I headed in here on a quiet day  Chrismas week for lunch with  good friend, just to check out some great Brooklyn Pizza, and because of the day/time likely there were no long lines at all.Tip: This place is a few minutes from a classic Italian Bakery Villabate Alba, so when in Rome, check out them both.Both made me want to drive in to Brookyn two days later again.. When looking around at our local bakeries and Pizza.   Brought a half box home &  it was gone quick.",12/30/2017,5000,842,1768,UMHC0kzV6TS8O6HLb5mpYw
740,Matt P.,0,5,"Nobody beats L&Bs pizza. Best square pizza. Period. Their original square pie coupled with their homemade spumoni provides the best of both worlds.

I was sad to see the slices were round, only because I came to try the square. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is your classic NY slice. No bullshit, just a wholesome slice of cheese. The baked clams came after and were pretty good. We split a Spumoni and chocolate cake to finish. The service is quick and gets things done. We decided to get some square slices to bring home, and Wow- That is why I would come back.",2/3/2016Previous review,358,284,214,0A70Y22bF6_wKV-tmaedSA

747,Edward H.,1,5,"My favorite pizza of all time. My Brooklyn friends in college used to deliver this pizza to me and it just brings back good memories. I remember when They first brought it they said it was the best. 5 slices later, I agreed. Not to be biased, but as a foodie, I have to say that this is my favorite. I've tried Chicago deep dish, Lombardi's, Luzzo's, and places in DC. This takes the cake. The bottom of the pizza is crunchy, the middle very moist with the bread and cheese combined perfectly, and it's all topped with a tasty tomato sauce with sprinkles of cheese on top. Careful, after you try the first bite, you get addicted and you start eating faster. Then you might burn the top of your mouth which is what happened to me. Ah well, worth it ;).  Definitely a place to try if you're in the area or within driving distance. The Spumoni ice cream is meh so I'm just rating this on the pizza. I've had the best homemade ice cream from farms in Virginia so these don't even come close. Tip: request for the edge piece so you can have something to grab the pizza with and try the crust. If you like the crust, get the corner piece, and if you just like the juicy pizza, then get a middle piece!",5/24/2018,31,142,321,QswyyvjF3F_fbosPDp3EdQ

751,S S.,0,5,Yeah. You need to come here and try the sun dried tomato chicken cutlet panini. NEED. I tried the chicken parm panini as well. It was a 3/5 for me. Too much sauce. And then you NEED to try the Spumoni ice cream. Not with a cone or any toppings. It is that phenomenal on its own. I'm happy I do not live across the street. I would eat this every day.

755,Evonna A.,0,5,"A friend of mine who is a brooklynite as I like to call her told me that I never had great pizza unless I had L&B's. Soooo one night we decided to go.  I must say, she was right!Firstly, this place is located in Brooklyn there's a lot of street parking you just have to look.  There are 3 parts, the regular pizza ahop, the ice shop and the actual resteraunt. I wanted to eat a lot so we went to the resteraunt. We had meatballs, a half tray of pizza, eggplant parm, white wine and for dessert of course their traditional spumoni. Let me just say, I've had a lot of pizza and I never had a slice quite like this. All of their pizza are square slices and they make it opposite to a regular slice.  Yoy have to eat the crust it's the best part. I believe they layer the  cheese then sauce then dough it's like an upside down pizza but soooooo delicious. Once you get pizza you'll def be full.  Their meatballs were delicious and they give large portions. I also enjoyed the eggplant parm but they put it over penney pasta which was just a little different for me.  The white wine they sell is amazing and actually really cheap. To top it off the spumoni was delightful. I'd go back here in the summer when I can sit outside and enjoy the day and my food at the same time.  The ambience of the place is very laid back you don't have to dress up or anything. It's very family oriented and the service is spot on. Our waiter was GREAT!A lot of famous people frequent this place so keep an eye out you may run in to a celeb.",5/7/2017,36,253,44,fedF39t6arqo9vUV2_MMxQ

The sandwiches are great also. It's always pack so be mindful of that. The restaurant gets really crowded, it's a popular spot for families to gather & fest.

They have seating both inside and outside. So if it's cold you can sit inside, but there isn't as many tables inside as they are out. I've heard they deliver, but it apparently takes long.

760,Kwame S.,1,4,"The hike deep into Brooklyn is worth it. If you want a NYC style pizza that is off the tourist path, then this place is for you. Also, it is a great place for pizza is you are an NYCer or soon to be NYCer. I came here here with a party of 8, with 6 of which were people from out of town, and the staff was very prompt and helpful by explaining things on the menu for my guests. The dining experience is very old school 70s/80s NYC without the male perms. Just note, we ate at Spumoni Gardens in late March, so it was not very crowed at all for dinner. I understand that this place is VERY popular in the summer and you may have to wait a while for table if you have a large group.   The pizza squares were pretty delicious. However, it was not the absolute BEST but it was pretty close. Sometimes I think that high ratings on Yelp can set unattainable experiences for certain places. I really liked the antipasti and calamari appetizers, the latter of which you can get grilled. Pizza aside, the spumoni is where it is at. I mean, the restaurant is called spumoni Gardens. So, save a little room in your belly for the rainbow spumoni.",4/7/2016,186,703,678,YYB_BOY3oHV2yOwOWMcD4A
761,Jessica C.,1,5,"What's to be said that hasn't been said already. Spumoni gardens provides both indoor (for Italian food) and outdoor seating (mostly for pizza goers). The line moves quick and pizza is made fresh to order. I've never had anything stale from here whether I came on a Tuesday or Saturday. I always get the typical Spumoni slice that has sauce on top then cheese then gooey bread (with or without crust depending on your preference). The sauce is thick and gives hints of oregano, Parmesan, and garlic. The cheese is the second layer which I feel adds to the taste. Often times the cheese covers the full flavor of a robust sauce. Being the layer below the sauce, let's you get the full flavor and texture not to mention color of the sauce. Lastly the bread which needs to be thick to hold so much hearty goodness above it! The bread is thicker than most ny pizza slices, but this isn't your ordinary ny slice. All in all the pizza is as good as Brooklyn pizza gets! Also the spumoni ice is surprisingly good! I'm not a fan of anything not chocolate but I couldn't help myself from devouring this authentically pistachio icee. My husband knows what a pizza fanatic I am and he told me this was a must try, and I'm so glad I did!",7/6/2017,214,141,238,2zlt0VIv60yPKkCZ9TuHEg
762,Brett G.,0,4,"This is a New York City institution for a reason. Simple ordering, simple menu, simple food but famous results. I went with regular slice and one Sicilian slice. Nothing special with the regular triangle slice but the square Sicilian was a different species. COB (cheese on bottom) pizza at its finest.  The cheese melding with the pizza dough for a magical chemistry that can only be replicated under a bed of marinara. Chewy goodness with a tangy sauce make this truly unique. For tourists this a slice of NYC, albeit it a Sicilian slice, with New York police officers grabbing a slice sitting a table over from transit subway employees. There is a reason New Yorkers and tourists line up for a slice.",5/5/2017,14,157,157,uRYKoBSy4IPU7ck0iYNaUg

We thought, "" sure we will give it a try.""  After a 45 minute subway ride we got seated. We had to flag the waiter down to get waters. Then again to get the same while the waiter blamed the buser.  We got our slices quickly. The thin crust was tasty, while the deep dish tasted like tomato soaked breadsticks. Nothing to get excited about. Then after 30+ minutes got our fried calamari which tasted fishy and funky, not what you want your fish to taste like. The four of us didn't even have a few bites. The pasta finally came. Again, good, but not anything that you can get at any mediocre Italian place in any city.

It's really convenient for me to just walk, take the train or bus here. I come here regularly now whether I buy a slice or a whole pie. I always go for the corner slices because I love the crust, then I top it with everything from garlic powder, chili flakes, and oregano. After pizza, I wash it down with some ice-cream. (which isn't my favorite either, it's hard for me to like certain ice-cream) I love their creamsicle ice-cream, it's so rich, creamy and sweet. I've dine in the restaurant a few years back and had ordered pasta for take-out but I don't remember how it was exactly.

770,Jessica R.,1,4,"A must when in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is a large borough and this at at the far end. Close to Coney Island and the belt parkway. I've ordered the squares and regular slices in the past and for some reason the slices are just okay. Not a fan of them. The squares are the best!  They have a separate line for slices,  pies, sandwiches and a restaurant which is good. They have a small parking lot next door but it could get a tad tight in there.  Parking in the area is horrid because there's a lot of driveways, hydrants etc..I never ate at the restaurant but I've ordered sandwiches from here as well. Their chicken parmigian hero is sooooooo good! The reason for the 4 stars is due to the fact that my square pie is always burnt on the edges and the bottom. I don't like that.

776,Daniel Z.,0,5,"Best leftover pizza ever.In the sea of NY style pizzas all across the city, L&B Spumoni Gardens is like an isolated secret swimming pool of pizza. Unlike many of their competitors throughout the city, L&B uses thick crust pizza, and places the sauce on top of the cheese. It's kind of like deconstructing and re-imagining how the pizza is made. Perhaps it's this way of crafting the pie that causes it to be so delicious the next day.So like I said at the beginning, it's the best leftover pizza I've ever had. During my dining experience, some friends took us here as we continued our pizza scouring adventures, and as we get there, my friends instantly ordered for us without giving us a chance to even see a menu. Two trays, one to eat there and one to go. As we ate there, I definitely knew this was a solid pie. Nothing mind blowing, but solid all the same. That night we go home and my friends were a little sad that we did not share their hardcore fandom of this pizza, and so we went to sleep. The next morning, we awoke and decided to heat up the to-go tray in the microwave, and by some voodoo magic, the pizza was actually better the day after than the night before. The sauce was tangier, the dough was fluffier but still had that crispy outside, and the cheese was melded into the dough more consistently. My mind was in shock of how overnight the pizza evolved like a pansy ass Magikarp turning into a strong Gyarados. I was in such shock that my mind came to one of two conclusions, either 1) over the night, someone broke into the apartment, and switched out our above average pizza with a phenominal one, or 2) like I stated above, somehow the pizza evolved like a pokemon under the full moon, revealing it's true greatness to us in the morning.To this day, we are still baffled as to how the pizza got better, but from that moment forward, the legend of the L&B leftovers took hold in our hearts, and is unanimously the best leftover pizza in our eyes.",2/25/2016,223,144,58,lq85CSZCN-gbvFqDHY8PDw

We got there 30 minutes before close and the staff was helpful in explaining the types of pies. Our first time here.There is also some ice cream next to it. Is this all one business? Anyways, the pizza was delicious. We got some spumoni after or I think thats what it is. Filled up our tummies for the drive back home.

789,Simon R.,1,3,"This place use to be much better. The squares don't taste as good as they use to back when I was a teenager. I use to spend every Friday having pizza night with my family and our go-to place was L&B. Nowadays, it's more of a, let's just grab a slice and go type-of-place. The ingredients are not the same so that's what makes the pizza taste differently and they raised their prices which I feel is absurd because the pizzeria use to be much busier a decade ago, (when the pizza actually tasted better). The ice cream on the other hand, I'll always come here for. Especially the Spumoni and Italian ices.",3/17/2016,222,116,175,PO2mGWIAE3KkGE50iVxXNQ
790,Sara L.,1,5,"10 stars please. The Sicilian slice is just near perfect and downright amazing at L&B. Delicious is the word. If you are a fan of the beloved square pizza, there is no reason to look further than here. L&B is truly the NY landmark of the beauteous and delicious Sicilian style slice.I will forewarn for those who aren't a fan of doughy, thicker crust, Sicilian style pizzas, then you may not entirely enjoy this. Those who complain of thicker crust, Sicilian are simply made to be that way, though with that, the crust on L&B has a really nice bite and texture when compared to other slices.  But it's best to be experienced fresh, and by the slice, though one can opt for a pie and/or delivered to your door if within proximity. But what pizza isn't best experienced right out of the oven. I've had their pizza in all the ways however; hot out of the oven, hot out of the box, warm from settling in the box, cold from leftovers, etc. Regardless of temperature, the flavor stays there. The crust still holds everything together. It again retains a nice crisp on the bottom and sweet airy fluffiness on the top that holds a perfect proportion of flavorful tomato sauce and melted gooey mozzarella. The difference here though with L&B is they reverse the cheese and sauce role -- the sauce is on the top and the cheese is on the bottom. The science behind this really works as the crust holds up very well next to ingredients. The sauce has a nice body and sweetness of flavor. The cheese just oozes but isn't the drippy oily gross cheese you'd come to expect. This is some quality cheese. This is some quality pizza.And we can honestly look past the decor and ambience of this place, but I find it to be very charming with its old school characteristics and history. You simply can't find a place like this anywhere in NY, that serves a respectable Sicilian as original and unique like this. All in all, make sure to take a trip to L&B with the expectation of having incredible pizza. And you don't even need the extra toppings.",1/31/2016,728,560,3619,xkM26UGl94s8OksWy2Dydg

Everything else was great, I noticed several other people on here saying that the pizza was undercooked, and I had never had that problem until my most recent visit. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again. But, the other food that we ordered was delicious. Prepare to wait for a very long time if you want to sit inside for a table. On Friday night, we waited about an hour and a half, & didn't sit down until 10pm. It also is very loud inside, at some points we couldn't even hear each other at the table.The staff is great, super welcoming and although the place is very busy, they always manage to come to the table to check in.",12/18/2016,1,38,70,tp9Vj9xMlrWmH0tsuxjSyg
794,Nobel V.,0,4,"Note that I have never dined in here, but from what I have had and my experience, this place hits the spot especially during a nice day where you can be outside, have some pizza and ice cream.  As it seems, many people have the same idea as you can expect lines and a crowded patio area during peak hours.Brooklyn is known to have some great pizza and L & B Spumoni Gardens does not disappoint!  They are known for their Sicilian Square Pies and I suggest you try these slices.  Note that these slices from the Sicilian are not crunchy, but more soft and on the chewy side.  I would suggest having these slices right away than having them to go, as I can imagine they get pretty soggy overnight.However, the taste of these slices are great.  The pizza is heavier on the sauce rather than the cheese, which I do not mind at all.  This allows the cheese to not be overwhelming and you will notice that most of the sauce is on top of the pizza.  You can also taste a bit of oregano in it.  Also, what wins me over with L & B Spumoni Gardens is that there is an option to get ice cream here!  I opted to get their L & B Spumoni (hence the name!) that contains Vanilla, Chocolate, and Pistachio.  I love Pistachios in general and they know how to make it well here! They also have Italian ices here that seem great to try during the summer.There is a dine-in area here so hopefully when I have a chance to stick around the area I will eat-in here and try their other offerings and entrees.  But even if I eat-in here, I will make sure I get a slice of their delicious Sicilian pizza!",1/31/2016,1011,315,1318,dAr6e-x6izK_Pi5OFAqiIg

Families, dates, and kids running around the red picnic tables, distorted radio playing overhead, and the pizza, the Italian ices. What a beautiful place. It's the most polarizing slice in the city. Most love it, some hate it. The square is almost dessert-like. Smooth, thick, like a bread milkshake covered in tomato sauce. And the round pie is just a round pie. Bypass it. You are here, you want the sheet pizza.

Do you know how hard it is to run a joint for that long in an area where businesses close at the drop of a hat because competition is too strong? This is a testament to how iconic L&Bs has become. Their squares are really the stars of the show here. Thick chewy dough but still perfectly crispy, topped with cheese then sauce. Heaven. When people ask what to eat their first time visiting Brooklyn, this is it. I tried the round pizza once ages ago but the Sicilian is so superior. I never made that mistake again. If you're planning on driving here, especially on a summer night, forget about parking. The lot is almost always full unless you don't mind waiting for something to open up or circle around for street parking. We usually have someone wait in the car while we pick up a tray, then bring it home to feast on. Can't say enough.

In short, I've hated every square slice I've gotten from everywhere EXCEPT at Spumoni gardens. The square slices here are on a soft, fluffy bread that has the lightest bit of crispiness at the bottom. The cheese is nothing to write home about but the tomato on top is super fresh and delicious.

A greasy ice cube with canes peas. The flavor was lacking anything but the oil they cooked it in, which apparently is calamari. Pizza came out next and too quickly. No flavor and it too had cold spots. My $15 chicken Marsala came out separately. Slimy chicken and did not taste fresh. Very thin. Straight out of a freezer bag. The pasta that came with it had no flavor either and was cold. Pasta was under cooked. Gravy too acidic and too watery. No bread or salad or anything. Waiter never came to ask how food was.

I haven't lived in Brooklyn in over ten years, however L&B remains a place in my ""food tour"" that just can't be missed. There's something about their pizza and spumoni that just can't be replicated. I will happily continue to make my yearly trip of gluttony here for as long as I can.

The line to get a slice was short so I hopped on and noticed an eager gentleman go in front of me. He looked at me and said I know I'm behind you I replied no problem. The guy behind the counter calls next and Mr. Eager decided to jump in front stretch his filthy hands over the counter to point out his slices. Eager then turns around, looks at me and says I'm so sorry. Your right, you are now excuse me as I get a slice. Now on to the food. When I 1st looked at the square pan I noticed tge squares were really small. I guess they're watching our waistlines to decrease the obesity rate. I picked my slices, an edge and a middle. I take it to go since the place was crowded and I wanted to sit and eat. Now my mouth is watering and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the big hype of L & B. Unfortunately, at 1st bite I was disappointed. The dough was a bit undercooked and it was very saucy. I took another bite just to make sure my taste buds weren't sleeping. They were wide awake and not impressed. The 2nd slice was a bit better because I topped it off with some oregano.  I should have ordered some spumoni to get a good feel for the raves on the menu.

My MD was a huge fan of this place and he wanted to make sure we tried them all. I enjoyed all the pasta dishes, the pizza came out and this was a NYC slice. The pizza was thick and cheesy and cooked to perfection ( I can still imagine the slices I had). We had a few (10 bottles) that were passed around for all three tables to enjoy. It was a great evening. The atmosphere was perfect, great company, and tasty food. I was a happy person. If someone asks for a new spot to take their friends, grab some good Italian food, or want a delicious sundae this is the place I usually refer them to if they are in the Brooklyn area and drive. Although trains are just one block away. As for the sundae......when we sat down they gave us something I haven't see on anyone's pictures.

That was impressive.I had to try some spumoni so I opted for the rainbow-so I could try all 3 flavors (chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio). I didn't love the consistency but it did taste amazingly like a rainbow cookie.There's a few seats inside, but a lot outside. Great for warmer nights.I know I might be scolded for this, but I have to say that I think a lot of the hype now is based on the name and reputation, not the actual pizza. The pizza is good, but nothing you can't find at lots of pizza places in the NYC area.",5/31/2017,815,1328,3076,y22jM83qCgsNGryv9328gQ

839,Alexa H.,0,4,"Went there yesterday 6/21 after our daughter's graduation. We shared the caesar salad and fried calamari. Both were very good--tasty and satisfying. We then each had our own square slice -- yummy and worth the trip to experience this style of pizza (we're native New Yorkers). My husband and I shared a 1/2 carafe of their house Chianti which went well with the meal. We finished off our meal with the Spumoni -- yummy and perfect way to end the meal on a hot afternoon.Since we wanted this meal to be a special celebration for our daughter, we opted to sit in the dining area and were seated within the enclosed terrace. The best part of the entire experience was Matt, our server. We got very lucky as the place was extremely busy with family celebrations -- birthday's, graduations, etc.-- and another server in the same room where we were seated we observed to be not as attentive, friendly or approachable. In fact he seemed to be quite put out by being there and serving people. Matt on the other hand was aware of our needs without us having to ask, prompt, and most importantly happy to serve us. The servers in the main dining area we observed were also working as hard as Matt and seemed to be interested in providing good service to their customers.My daughter was delighted to spend her celebration lunch at L&B Spumoni Gardens and we will more than likely go again.",6/23/2016Updated review,0,71,0,RBBLR9rn2dyrWyzl1kPBHw

844,Kenneth L.,0,4,"L&B's Sicilian square pizza is the best pizza you can get in the neighborhood by the slice. I agree that it's over-hyped after the countless times I've ate here. Regardless of the hype, it's still a solid choice to satisfy your hunger and taste-buds. There is usually a constant flow of customers so expect a fresh tray to be waiting for you at the pizza window. I personally like the corners because I like the charred crunchy crust. The cheese melts underneath the sauce giving it a unique texture. The sauce is semi-sweet and tangy. It's a no brainier why they've been in business for so long. Over the past weekend, I placed a phone order for 2 Sicilian trays ($40 a tray), 1 catering sized baked ziti, and 1 catering sized Caesar's salad to feed the guests that came over for a party. Not 1 single slice left over and not 1 single complaint. Baked ziti ($35) was finger licking good (feeds 8-10) Salad ($30) was meh. I'd substitute for pasta in the future. Do yourself a favor and head over to the desserts window and order a Spumoni. There are real pistachios! The Spumoni ice/ice cream is rich and flavorful.",11/16/2015,228,73,609,YG5QKV0E2zm8d_mhrB0pcQ

851,Amy N.,1,4,"We always pick the wrong days to come! Plan A, we come and realize there isn't any parking, no seats, on top of that, long lines! But we came hungry! So our plan B, I get out the car with the kids and look for a table, Cindy would start getting on line to order, by the time Derek finds parking he's here ready to help Cindy bring the food over to our table. Now that's what I call teamwork! We always get their square, half a pie and our most favorite, spumonis and ices! First, the pie, a master pizza cutter cuts it into big even squares. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Crust is crispy! You can also add toppings to the pizza, but only if you buy the whole pie. Now...the ices! You would feel overwhelmed when you see the list of flavors they have. I've tried all their flavors, all outstanding, and I still don't know what I want. Wondering why the line isn't moving, huh? Lol. I recommend the lemon, cherry, vanilla chip and the pistachio. Ooo! They also have seasonal flavors like watermelon and passion fruit! Never tried anything else beside their pizza, we're gonna go adventurous next time.

860,Cathy C.,1,4,"My sausage brothers who are originally from New York told me I had to come here and that it's the only reason to ever go to Brooklyn. My friend and I hopped on the N train from Manhattan to Brooklyn so we can have dinner. We got to the 86th station. Oh my, the area isn't well-lit and there were Mexican guys saying ""Chino! Chino!"" Oh, great...I'm going to have to headbutt somebody...again.I was told Brooklyn people are ""different"" but I wasn't sure what that meant since my aunt, uncle and cousin are from there and they don't seem different to me. I loved the people from Spumoni Gardens when we went there. Chatty, loud, with a Brooklyn accent and friendly - the type I find hilarious.  The hostess was very helpful. Our servers were fantastic veeeeerrrry friendly. We were chatting it up and next thing you know, pretty much everyone that worked there including the lovely yet spunky manager were at our table...chatting and laughing! It was like I've known them for years!I planned to get meatballs, arancini, a round slice and a Sicilian slice. But our server told us the pizzas by the slice only come in cheese - no other toppings. Although New York cheese pizza is delicious, I was in the mood for some sausage and pepperoni. So, we got the small (12 slices) of Sicilian pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. I immediately sent my sausage brothers a picture of my pizza. They were disappointed in my failure in ordering pizza the ""right way"" which is plain cheese. *shakes fist*. We also got calamari, arancini and spumoni (of course). It's worth mentioning that they have shakers for oregano, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and chili flakes at each table. Mmmmm...garlic powder.Calamari:This was pretty typical fried squid rings. The marinara had a very mild flavor so my friend had to add salt, pepper, Parmesan on hers. 3/5Arancini:I'm not a fan of rice but if it's Italian rice balls? Now, we're talking! Take my Asian card away if you wish. You get 3 rice balls lightly breaded with bread crumbs. The rice has meat and peas mixed in. The sauce is light with some melted cheese. 4/5Sicilian Pizza:Despite my pizza being topped with failure called pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms - I thought this was really good. They use real tomatoes - the sauce was sweet. The crust was thick. The small pizza we got was huuuuge! I was only able to eat a slice. 5/5Spumoni:You shouldn't call yourself ""Spumoni Gardens"" if your spumoni sucks. I love spumoni and I liked this. We only ordered one but they gave us another one for free. 4/5My friend was afraid to leave and walk back to the train station. It didn't help when our servers told her ""if you go past dataway, you might get shot at."" Hahaha! My advice is to relax, it hurts less that way. But seriously, just have presence of mind and don't act like a stupid and helpless tourist and you'd be fine (this applies anywhere). This is my ghost competing this review.

883,Deborah D.,0,5,"I had been dying to go to Spumoni gardens after hearing the rave reviews of some of my Italian and Brooklynite friends and I finally got my chance a few weeks ago! It absolutely exceeded my expectations. After visiting the Dyker Heights lights on the eve of Christmas Eve, myself, sister, and friend headed over here to grab a late dinner. We arrived at 8:30 and were told it would be about a half hour wait. We thought this was totally reasonable, especially given the huge crowd of people waiting. Well, we ended up waiting an hour, eventually being seated at 9:30 PM. We were so tired and it was hard to stand for so long after walking around to see the lights, but they gave out some free slices while we waited to the groups. It was so good we weren't willing to leave. When we sat down, we ordered a half sheet and a caesar salad to split. It was so so good! The pizza had a nice, chewy and crunchy crust and a smoky flavor that I really enjoyed. Even the diet coke we had was really good! We saw everyone else in the restaurant getting dessert platters and so we had to order one for ourselves too! The mountain of cones, spumoni, and tartufo all stacked together with toppings was impressive and indulgent. A definite must-do at least once! Overall, this was probably one of the top meals I have ever eaten!! And, the price was right. The portions are so enormous they can easily be shared among a group, so you really get an amazing deal.

We were on our way back to Long Island from PA and figured we would stop in and see what all the fuss was about. People say ""pizza is pizza"" but when you live on Long Island and a pizza place is every 200 feet, you learn what a good slice/pie is and you become loyal to that one slice. Thick, thin crust, is it greasy, are you adding garlic powder and parmesan cheese...all the questions you as a pizza addict must think about when choosing your favorite place. So Spumoni Gardens....we tried both the round pie and square pie. The round pie was cold a minute after, I mean cold. Overall, it was good. Not great or excellent. It was thin, not too greasy, and we didn't add any toppings or seasoning. The square slice was different, no cheese. Initially I was like ""a slice of pizza without cheese, what?""...slice was good, it was super hot, and different from what we were used to. I would go back when I'm in the area for a square slice.

A bit salty, but still good.Dessert was a disappointment for us. The ices were weak in flavor. spumoni was okay. Tiramisu was heavy on the liquor taste.

894,Carrie H.,0,4,"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. It's far, but worth the subway ride there. I took the N and got off 86th street. When you get off just take a right turn and go straight until 11th st. I've had a few deep dish pizzas but this is by far the best. I live in California and visited New York and was told by a friend to stop by spumoni's and I was not disappointed. There are 3 parts to the restaurant. When facing Spumoni's starting from the left is the pizza shop, then the ice cream window, and lastly the restaurant on the right. Seating outside is abundant, but inside the pizza shop is small.At first bite of the Spumoni deep dish square it had a hint of sweetness to it. The bottom was crispy and perfect! The cheese is on the bottom and then the sauce on top so it kept the bread from getting soggy. They even give you an option of middle or side piece (I chose side)!For $2.75 a slice, it is worth it. Though the pizza is so simple it is full of flavor and the workers are very nice! For dessert I had the Spumoni rainbow ice cream with pistachio, vanilla and chocolate. For a small it was $3.75. Though interesting it was a little underwhelming compared to the pizza and also I feel that there are better places to get ice cream around ny! Overall worth the long ride and if you're going in the summer might as well visit Coney Island since it's one subway stop away!",12/14/2015,5,11,6,Ev2bMx33M67Bzv4DAXTp1A

897,Priscilla M.,0,4,"Being a pizza lover, I always loved L&B and it being a true Brooklyn classic especially in the summer when sitting outside is eventful. My favorite part about this slice is the crispy crust and the perfected gooey dough. It's very saucy and sweet & the grated cheese sprinkled on top makes it unique. However, the acid reflux that follows isn't cool with me. If you go inside to eat, a must try are the artichokes. Love it.

902,Dr. Jason T.,0,5,Don't even ask me what I think of this place! Are you friggin kidding me?! I have been coming here since I was friggin born. Best pizza in Brooklyn. Don't friggin argue with me it's my opinion and I can say what I want since this is my review. If you live in Brooklyn and you have never been to L&B it's about time you get your @&%# over there!  If you don't like it then either there is something wrong with you are you have a gripe against someone that loves L&B. Too bad for you. They are famous for their Sicilian pizza and that's the only thing I have ever gotten so don't ask me about regular slices. I also recommend sitting in the restaurant side and ordering the chef's table. It's 50 bucks a person and you pretty much get a little bit of everything. Well worth it.,9/7/2017,27,109,110,6NBcwTtC4FbMEBjqLKFiUw
903,Omer M.,1,3,Not particularly blown away by this place.  They specialize in the Sicilian slice- I guess made famous by publicity on Travel Channel food show.  I am not getting anything special from this slice- it's decent.  If you like more sauce (again nothing special but I do note that it's not overly sweet- something I don't like my sauce being) than cheese.  Reasonably priced for a slice with soda.  Large seating outside.  Parking a bit of challenge in the area.  Not worth a long trek since there are many great pizza places in the NY area.,10/18/2015,43,169,877,H70aPTaH9zVm3nCS6yvGuA

Note I went there in December 23rd so that may have been the reason as they were slightly understaffed. Do I recommend? Definitely yes!Go for the pizza stay for the wine!

Lasagna was seasoned right and the portion was big too I think almost a 7 or 7.5x5 inch slice. The only thing I have to say is that it can get extremely loud in here and the floors in the main dining room are extremely slippery.

915,Christine G.,0,3,"I love the idea of this pizza. Good quality dough, cheese, and sauce. Form the dough Sicilian style, but put the cheese down first. Cover with the sauce, sprinkle with the Parmesan, bake, and enjoy. Simple yet different. I consider this pizza a real treat. I've tried making it at home. It usually comes out mostly ok. I expect it to be better when I get it from the iconic original source, because they are L&B, and in the special Sicilian pizza world, I'm pretty much nobody.It used to be better. But this time, it wasn't. The quality seemed a little off. The flavors underwhelmed. And it kind of made me sad.Maybe it was just a bad day. The pizza wasn't bad by any means. But when you've had this pizza in its prime, a bad day can be really disappointing. On a positive note, a nice man slicing cheese overheard my daughter marveling at all the men making pizza as we waited in line for the bathroom, and he turned around and offered her a slice. She thought it was delicious, and I appreciated the gesture. It's not bad at L&B. It just isn't what it used to be.",9/3/2016,42,51,21,psbqfAyFo2tqx__zy7xoOg
916,Conrad E.,0,5,My favorite sicilian squares in all of Brooklyn and thereby all of NYC and all of the US as a whole. They have been around for 70+years for a reason. The other food here is well above average but the sicilian squares are the reason to visit.,6/16/2018,0,15,3,Mg_rn-_MsEf_Ox2LIcSiqQ
917,Ben L.,1,5,"THIS PLACE IS FAR! Yes, it's in the middle of no where Brooklyn, but is it worth the drive? One million percent yes! You come here for one thing only, OK maybe two things, yeah you only come here for two things only: the squares and ice cream. The reg slice is a reg slice, it's almost not even worth mentioning. I have to admit though, in typical Ben fashion, I will have to go back just to try their other stuff, to test out the menu. The al fresco dining is also really nice, especially on a summer day.The food:Square- This is one of my favorite Sicilians slices. The dish is different from your average Sicilian in that they actually do a layer of cheese and then the sauce on top. The sauce is excellent, there is a subtle sweetness and a great tang to the sauce. The cheese is ooey/gooey and the bottom is nicely crunchy. A fantastic square. If you get a whole pie, try to get one that is already made, the fresh pies have a soft/spongy bottom and takes away from the slice. yelp.com/user_local_phot…yelp.com/user_local_phot…Slice- it's just a plain ole slice.Spumoni- I am a big fan of their rainbow spumoni. It's kinda like a Italian tri-flavored ice cream. The flavors are chocolate, pistachio, and cremolata, which is a vanilla almond-cinnamon. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Nocciola Hazelnut Ice Cream- This absolutely gets no love what so ever but their hazelnut ice cream is fantastic. It's super creamy and has an excellent hazelnut taste. I just had a motherf'in epiphany, the Hazelnut is better than the rainbow spumoni. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",9/5/2013,982,1017,2816,Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

As I've gotten older my taste buds have changed, and my craving for a particular pizza has changed. This place gives you just the regular slice, nothing fancy, no brick oven, no thin crust, but it will satisfy your pizza craving. They also have a restaurant inside, I have never tried their regular food, so I can't comment on it. They have a separate place outside for Italian ices, which are very good. As for service, it's a help yourself? Order the pizza wait for it, take a seat, grab some napkins, don't forget to ask for paper plates, and clean up after yourself, pretty straight forward, pretty much the Brooklyn attitude",8/4/2015,3175,594,1799,c78V-rj8NQcQjOI8KP3UEA

The decorations on the wall, colorful and festive. We had a delicious meal visiting family. I would highly recommend this place if you are ever in Brooklyn. We made reservations which was good because the place was packed! The room we waited in was crowded but warm. They kindly provided bread for the kids. It was interesting because they would not seat us until all people in our party were present. There were 10 of us and even after we were all present, we still had to wait for them to set the table. We ordered mozzarella salad which was fantastic, lightly salted and the cheese melted in my mouth. We also had a green salad which was filled with large slices of tomatoes and green olives. The dressing was light and citrusy, delicious. The chicken Parmesan had a delicious flavor. The sauce was light and the chicken was a nice thin cutlet of chicken. The pizza was tasty, the cheese and tomato sauce was delicious. Great crust! Great sauce! The lasagna was light and flavorful. Excellent combination of meat, cheese and sauce. For dessert we had chocolate ice, ice cream and mouse pie. The ice was light and crisp with a nice chocolate flavor. The vanilla ice cream was thick, creamy and delicious and the mouse cake, creamy and light. A real NY gem of a restaurant.

936,Andrew D.,0,5,"Sure its good and I like the slices there.  And you can double park with no hassle and all that kind of good stuff too.I'm guessing its popularity comes part from the tastiness and part from my assumption that Brooklyn has changed around it but it has kept its foothold and remained true to itself.  And that's always worth something to me.The crowd is great with a huge range; teens on summer dates to hard core meat heads with huge muscles and lots of color in between.So here's why I go back:Very good slices and spumoniUnapologetically curt 'service' that is somehow a little endearingThe 'unchanged' for a long time feel that is only possible when you have a good productGreat people watching, its a little bit of a freak show in the best way.Everybody there loves it which is infectiousGo double park, grab a slice and watch the show while you decide the shape of #2 slice.",9/19/2016,0,51,0,MlQZ0tiMHzLelMlp97VALg

Best pizza in NYC, best in Brooklyn, one of the best they've ever had, and so on. Some people randomly bring this place up when I talk about NYC pizza. And then just read some of the reviews on here.With that sort of hype, it better be utterly incredible to score a 5.Well this was some of the most bland, nondescript pizza I've had, not just in NYC but anywhere. I only had a few bites and then I was done. And my partner in crime at the time was obsessed with pizza, and she had exactly the same opinion. Which was annoying since we'd just bought several slices.I tried to salvage their rating by getting an Italian Ice (Lemon). It was some of the worst, chemical tasting, weird, unsatisfactory Italian Ice I've had.I'd give them a 3 to support family businesses, but the service wasn't very nice either. They were none too friendly, and it's grossly overrated. So that's down to a 2.So if someone tells you this is the best pizza you'll ever have, remember that in my opinion, L & B may stand for ""Lies & Baloney.""",6/23/2015,4216,10071,35822,Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA

960,R S.,0,4,"This place is a New York legend and anyone looking for a taste of real New York Italian food must visit here. Its a destination spot that you go out of your way for. There really isn't much else nearby. But the fact that its located out of the way in a residential neighborhood location doesn't make parking any easier! If you are lucky you will get into the small adjacent lot. If you arrive at lunchtime plan to walk a bit.I came here looking for pizza because this is on everyone's list of the top 10 pizza places in the city but I can't really compare it to other places which typically serve a variation on thin slice pizza cooked quickly in high temperature coal burning ovens. This pizza is nothing like that.It's basically what most call 'Sicilian style' thick crust square pizza altho they also serve a variation that is a round pie. Most come for the traditional thick square which has a thick slice of mozzarella cheese placed on the dough first underneath the sauce. The top layer of sauce is so thick you can barely see the cheese underneath and they sprinkler a parmesan dusting over it to top it off. I've also seen this kind of slice called 'Grandma style'The dough is chewy and cooked in enough grease that you will notice the underside is also most fried to a crisp with nice dark char marks. It's great fresh out of the oven, very heavy if you eat it later cold and if you reheat it in your oven at home the next day, the crunch that returns to the crust is sublime!It's simple, tasty and very filling. I dare anyone to eat more than 4 slices in one sitting. You can get toppings added but why bother trying to replicate traditional pizza? This is its own thing and it works well. One thing to note with this pizza is you will find the pieces with crust tend to be tastier. The crust retains more of that pleasing crunch so if you get a middle piece with no crust it doesn't seem as good. It's almost like have a really good breadstick along with your pizza.Aside from the pizza I also had to try their namesake 'spumoni' ice cream. I was shocked to find out $5 only got me a serving the size of a small Dixie cup! I would recommend just buying a pint to take home. It's one of the best spumoni ice creams I've ever had so you won't regret having more to enjoy later.They counter service for the ice cream and pizza ordering is very old school. Based on what I read of the history of this place these are the original counters that have been there for 75 years serving the same food. Amazing.They also do a brisk business with a sit-down restaurant that is also on site and its packed every time I have been there. I haven't tried the sandwiches or Italian pasta dishes yet. They are serving all the usual dishes you would expect and based on what I saw they all looked tasty and worth a try.I would not place L&B in my top ten pizza list simply because it doesn't seem fair to compare their pizza to the traditional style everyone else serves.However I would rank it #1 in the city for Sicilian style square cut pizza as well as spumoni! For all I know this place was one of the first in NYC (and possibly the United States) to serve this kind of pizza.Please patronize this place and keep it around for another 75 years! It's too good to lose.",4/21/2018,1,56,0,RIIbgqf6W7-9s29ymCyreQ

962,Christopher C.,0,4,"I dunno if it's just that I had grown accustomed to regular pizza where the tomato sauce is under the cheese, but it tasted odd to me at first. However, as I bit into it some more, the slice of Sicilian grew on me.  The dough was delicious and chewy, with a slight touch of crispiness on the borders.  Sauce tasted like real tomatoes, but the cheese was average.This is a big establishment, they had three different areas that housed pizza orders, ice cream and a full sit down Italian restaurant with pasta.  The lines might look intimidating at first but they are actually pretty fast. There are two lines for pizza, one for pies and one for single orders.  Single slices were quick, service just wasn't the greatest, as they are just trying to sell and move on to the next customer. The popular rainbow Spumoni is a mix of chocolate, vanilla and pistachio icey/ice cream mix. It's not ice but also less creamy than ice cream.  I really enjoyed the pistachio (includes actual pistachio chunks!) and chocolate parts of it. Vanilla not so much.",9/12/2015,69,106,446,0enj68thjf6PR4aBJ0EoyA

970,Sylvia L.,0,3,"I have mix feelings about l&b.My first impression when I dined here was ""how rude!"" The host walked us to our table and threw the menu on the table. It really wasn't necessary to do that since the table wasn't that far for her to reach. (*)Food came out pretty fast, but it probably came out fast because kitchen closes at 10 and we got there at 930. (****)We orders the famous half tray scilian pizza which comes with about 12 slices and cost $21. I must say the quantity was huge but the quality has changed. It was super hot to bite into and alot of tomato sauce, but there wasn't much cheese and the crust was not crispy like how it was back then. It felt more like bread and no toast to it. (***)I ordered the chicken parmesan as entree and this portion was smaller. I prefer the chicken parmesan I had in puglia because it was crispy and the sauce was more different and unique. I'm all about the tomato sauce and I feel like the sauce here is just average. I didn't like the fettuccine that came with this dish, the texture felt really thick and it didn't really look appetizing. (**)My waiter was quick and on his feet. He over head me finishing my soda and asking if I wanted refills. (****)Not to sure how clean they are with food, but I saw a waiter restock the cheese they gave us for the spaghetti. Looks like they will reuse the cheese if you don't finish. (*)",6/1/2016,56,245,54,fMrV62gzDWGEtCgD-xcS6g

I've been here more times than I can remember since I was a kid. The Sicilian slice... omg, the bread is thick and charred with more sauce than cheese ratio, it's just perfect. There's not much else I can add that hasn't already been said about this pizza. If you are in NY, you just NEED to stop by here at least once in your life. The outdoor seating makes this a nice place to hang out, especially in the summer.The spumoni is the perfect thing to finish off your pizza with. Don't be turned off by the bright green color, there are chunks of delicious pistachios in there, they don't mess around with their spumoni! Don't like the icy texture? Try the equally delicious selections of ice cream flavors, or get a sundae (lots of toppings to choose from). The tiramisu ice cream is so creamy and smooth, give it a shot! Can't get enough?

We usually order Cesar salad to share with two. Then I always order chicken Francese. It's ALWAYS fresh and made right lemony and just the way it should be. The waiters are always full of energy, attentive, and down to earth. Even the guys that clear your table are sweet and respectful and hold conversations with you if you allow.

979,Monica P.,1,5,"This place has fallen off over the recent years. It's just not as great as it was a few years back. That being said, I'm only giving it all 5 stars still because I grew up loving L&Bs and it's been a Brooklyn Staples in pizza for over decades now plus the L&Bs slice might not be the same as it use to be, but regardless it's still pretty freaking good.So the only two things you get here for what they're extremely famous for;The SICILIAN SLICE - always out piping hot and FRESH. The crust is always fantastic here, not too thick or thin, hard or doughy. It's crispy on the outside and soft with a well seasoned tomato sauce, salty sweet and tangy, all the right combo flavor sitting well. **NOBODY GETS THE SLICE. You're not here for the slice seriously, it's sub-par.SPUMONI - I get why people love it. It's a lot of strong creamy flavors going on... Get it if you're a pistachio lover. I never loved pistachio... Though I did have delightful pistachio flavored desserts before. This still hasn't steered me to change my mind though even after giving it two chances. But hey, everyone seems to love it. So get it, I'm sure it'll end your pizza grub off perfectly.I've had the restaurant side a few times before, it was never great but mediocre.

985,Michelle B.,0,5,"Classic Brooklyn pizza! When you come here, be sure to get the Sicilian (square) slice and the spumoni. Their slices have the cheese melted into the bread, then it is topped with sauce and a bit of olive oil. From there, you can always add garlic, red pepper flakes, and oregano. The pizza is here is nice and fluffy and the crust has a crunch to it. So good! I'm not usually a pistachio fan, but when I'm here I will get the spumoni. It had a great creamy texture and great chocolate and vanilla flavors as well. But that's not all - it's cheap too! I came in on a Sunday night with four other friends. It was a little chilly outside, so we decided to eat in the restaurant. It's a very typical Italian restaurant inside, which doesn't match the laid back, summery feel of the outdoor seating area. We ordered the calamari (nothing too special there) and half a pie (12 slices). All in all, it came out to around $10 each with tax and tip. We were all full, and we still had some pizza left. Definitely got our money's worth :) Service was good! We were seated right away and our sever started us off with waters and bread.

987,Jing B.,0,5,"Can I say- best pizza ever!? They're notorious for their square slice, and although I've tried many other 'famous' pizza places, L&B's still ranks as my top favorite! And to top that, their square slices remain below $3 (bring cash), whereas other pizzerias have increased their prices. The square slices are different than most, where the cheese is on the bottom and sauce is on top, and it's perfected on its crisp!! Try to ask for a corner slice, or things will get messy! In the wintertime, their outdoor seatings are closed off. They also have an indoor area that serves as a restaurant with waitstaff. Though, I believe you can still grab a quick slice at the window. In the warmer days, they open up their outdoor seatings and this place is always packed! Another great thing about this place is that there is a small parking area for your car. I also recommend their spumoni as a dessert or summer snack - this isn't ice cream but it falls In between an icier version of an ice cream, or a creamier version of an ice. They come in 3 flavors- vanilla chocolate and pistachio - or the mix, which is all three. If you're not up for this, they also have regular ices that are great too.

995,Kristen M.,0,5,"Oh my goodness unicorns do exist! Known for having one of the best slices in New York, it was only a matter of time before I got a chance to find out for myself. I love it when the hype is real. I grew up in Jersey, with a sentimentally perfect small pizza shop a few blocks from home. It remains the slice I compare all slices too, right or not, and few places serve a slice that make me feel like a kid again.  Then along came Spumoni. At first bite I was twelve years old again tumbling into my local pizza shop, sticky and muddy from a soccer game, starving and ready to devour a plain slice. There was nothing better. One of life's true pleasures. Spumoni took me back to my happy pizza place. While I had a plain slice, my friend had the square slice they are known for. I was doubter. Until I took a bite of his slice and realized the error of my ways. I don't usually like square slices. But at Spumoni, I wouldn't hesitate ordering one next time.  Adding to the moment, we ate outside at one of the tables, enjoying one of the first hot sunny days of the year. Which could only mean one thing. Once done with pizza, it was time for ice cream! We wanted that ice cream so much, we dug deep into our coin purses to pay after realizing there was a ten dollar credit card minimum. Although I did offer to take one for the team and eat more ice cream if we needed to hit the ten dollar minimum. Luckily, we found just enough coins to pay in cash. There will be a next time for me and Spumoni Gardens. Especially with it's proximity to Coney Island, another fave of mine, my return to Spumoni is bound to be sooner rather than later.",6/12/2017,76,188,103,tRaBEG8_H4zatxCHkjdiFw

997,Muhammad H.,0,5,"Whenever I have friends come up to New York that are looking to try good pizza, I always take them here. The Sicilian slice is unlike any other. The price is very reasonable.

998,Mike C.,1,5,"It's worth coming to the ends of the earth in Brooklyn for the pizza here.It's like the mini J&R of Italian restaurants: they have 3 or 4 different places in a row, each specializing in a different food: on the far left in the corner is the pizzeria, followed by the ice cream shop that has the famous Spumoni, followed by a counter for takeout of pizzas and pastas, and lastly the sit-down restaurant that has a full menu of Italian food.We came here to get the much talked about and hyped Square Slice at the pizzeria.The exchange when my wife asked for a cup of water was pretty hilarious to watch:- Her: May I please have a cup of water?- Pizza Guy: $1.50- Her: For tap water?!?- Pizza Guy: [pauses for a bit] FINE, GIVE ME A CUP (gesturing angrily to the stack of plastic cups behind her).In spite of this abusive treatment, I'll stick with the high rating because they serve up a really authentic, delicious slice of pizza, and they brought out a piping hot, fresh pie right when we got there after a long journey. It's a pretty bare bones menu in the pizzeria (yelp.com/biz_photos/l-an…), but that's all you really need. Just spend $2.25 to get one of those delicious square slices, and you'll leave happy.After wolfing down the delicious slices under the spiteful/watchful eyes of the pizza guys, we strolled next door to try some of that Spumoni ($2.50 for a small cup). I really liked it. It's kind of like if gelato and Italian Ices had a baby.By the way, the square slice here is way better than at Di Fara, mostly because you can walk right in, grab a seat easily at the plenty available tables, and you don't have to wait arbitrarily long times to just get a single slice, depending on how slow the single guy making the pies there is. The treatment you get is pretty shabby at either one, but it doesn't sting as badly here since you don't have to wait forever to get your slice. Also, the slices here aren't as ludicrously priced ($2.25 instead of $4).If I ever get the urge for some real Italian food in an authentic setting and want to travel insanely far away from home for it for some reason, I would definitely come back here to try out the restaurant as well after getting another square slice.",2/10/2013,5000,1736,73331,37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q

1001,Freddy V.,1,4,"L&B's is a unique pizza eating experience.  The Pizzeria has been around for over 75 years serving the South Brooklyn neighborhood and anyone that has come across the name.  They have a huge outdoor eating area where you can purchase your pizza, soda, water, and Spumoni Ice Cream and enjoy it in the outdoors with the kids. L&B's square pizza is different than your ordinary pizza as they prepare it by putting the cheese on top of the bread with oil and finish off with the sauce on top of the cheese.  The square slices are thick but extremely tasty.  If you're a health freak this is definitely not the place for eating pizza as I heard the calories count for each slice is around 450.  Since I'm a big guy, I usually have 2 or 3 slices with a coke and then go to the next counter and finish off my experience with a sugar rush of Spumoni Ice Cream. YUMMY!Next door L&B's has a restaurant that serves all home made Italian dishes.  I've never eaten at the restaurant before but heard the food and prices were amazing.  I normally would rate this 5 stars but took one star off because of the parking issues the restaurant presents.  There is only room for around 10 cars in the lot but the place usually holds inside and outside seating for around 50-75 families at any given point.",7/29/2013,61,302,157,Zi1TJPPIkkjmLpw1PdBHIg

Our pizza was ready in minutes and it smelled so...so...good. The first bite of the crusty, red velvety tomato sauce sprinkled with Parmesan cheese was a true foodgasm.

You really have to be consistent though when you've been in business for as many years as L&B has.The Sicilian slice is what you come here for and of course you have to finish it up with some of their spumoni.   It's always an enjoyable experience here and is perfect for groups, families and pretty much anyone.I'm tempted to say it's better to come either extremely hungry or with a large group just so you can delight in getting an entire pie.The staff are all super efficient and fast and there's quite a bit of seating available.

We opted for this when the sit down area was packed with a wait. So we just took it to go and ate in the car. The bomb! It's a pretty good deal and two square slices should put you down, maybe 3 if you're really starving. Unfortunately it's pretty deep in South Brooklyn, so I can't always make it out.

1022,Marqus A.,0,2,"I need to be clear within my review --- The FOOD, is A+ --- if I can just rate the food, the food would be 10 STARS!As for the service... Pretty GOT DAMM ridiculous, it was truly appalling. This place is really really far, it is in the pits of Brooklyn - driving in is a mission, and taking the train feels like you're taking the Amtrak to Connecticut. So once you do arrive, it feels like you've reached mecca. In the summers, this place is worth it, you get there with friends, order a nice sicilian pie and you can sit out in the picnic style tables. In the winter, I WILL NEVER SHOW UP AGAIN! This was actually my first time in the restaurant side... Overall it's decent; it's your cliche Italian style restaurant with the marble like slabs on the wall, too many mirrors, and tiled floors (which for wet winter shoes and boots, plus food grease, turned the floors into a slip and slide, I almost slipped along with some waiters 3 times). The waiters dressed in the traditional black and white outfits with black vests and white button shirts.SO here is where the problem starts... I arrived with my gal and partner in crime from Austin, TX --- we came in from Jersey, which took us 1 hour and 45 minutes... This whole time I am convincing her, ""THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!"" --- we get there and we are seated FAST, which was awesome, and besides the food, that was about the only awesome thing.We were sat down around 6:00pm, and we did not get a waiter until 6:15pm... We almost got up and left, but that time on the road, I needed to tap into my zen meditation and relax haha. So we order our food, and a couple is seated to our right and a WHOLE family is seated to the left, as in a WHOLE family tree of people, im talking grandparents, parents, kids, nieces, nephews, grand kids you name it... Ok so we ordered some mussels in white wine sauce, antipasto salad, and a half tray sicilian pie - noting crazy, right???Well the couple next to us, on the right, got their pie (same sicilian pie) within 5 minutes. In that same time span of 20minutes, the whole family on our left got ALL of their apps. Meanwhile we're twiddling our thumbs... Im a patient man, but this was truly testing my patience. I stopped our waiter twice, and he said your apps should be coming out. It took 32min total for us just to get a antipasto salad!!! The thing is just cold cuts, veggies and cheeses - WTF!??? By the time we got our measly antipasto (which by the way was amazing - food is not the problem in this place, its the damn waiter - and this particular waiter) the couple on the right finished eating, paid their bill and left...The whole family to our left, was well into their main course.... But still no mussels in white wine sauce - I had to literally get up and confront my waiter. After that quick face to face, we got our mussels --- they were ok, they were pretty grimey, not the cleanest mussels. So here we are, an hour since we've arrived, and still no Pizza --- I get up and confront my waiter again, at this point I have to admit my stance and demeanor was not the most pleasant, but I had to ask him ""what gives??? Ive been here an hour, and I have no pizza!???? - people have come and gone, and we are still here waiting"" I even spoke to the manager --- at this point the waiter was ignoring us, not even asking if we needed a refill on our drinks, and giving me a sort of wiseguy attitude...When our pizza finally arrived, it was bitter-sweet. It tasted so amazing, but at this point we were paranoid, upset, and just frustrated... Paranoid that the soda offered to us from the back when there was a fountain in front of us, may have spit --- paranoid that we were being singled out for some weird reason (are these guys not friendly to bearded men? lol), it got so bad, we insisted we package our left overs on our own - we really thought the A-hole waiter we had was capable of spitting or doing something worse to our food.I complained one more time to the manager, and insisted we pay the cashier directly, we did not want to give him any money - and we did not tip him at all. I have maybe done that once, when I was a teenager at a diner - but as an adult I always tip. This time I did not tip at all, this guy was truly the worst waiter in the world. After hearing our complaints, the manager and another waiter offered to give us some canolis on the house and a free coffee - I told him thanks but no thanks - at this point we were so paranoid and upset, we just wanted to leave. I appreciated the gesture, but overall it was kind of the worst experience Ive had with service in YEARS...We bumped into a couple with a baby outside, and I could not help to ask them how their experience was - they too were beyond pissed off. They had the same complaints as us, and were very disappointed. Overall, the food is amazing, but the service in the restaurant side seems to be hit or miss...

One bite of this pizza and I was gone. Done. I think I had 4 slices at the restaurant, another in the car on the way home, and one or two more once home. Yes I wanted to die, but the taste...oh man. It can't be beat. It's almost BETTER leftover. How is that possible??Now, for a fun project, everywhere I go in the world I eat pizza just to compare to L&B and see if I can find better. I've had pizza all over Italy, most of Europe, Kenya, China, Indonesia, Thailand, east and west coasts of the US, etc....nothing better. I'm going to start a pizza blog at some point and my ratings will be 1 to Spumoni Garden.The sauce is amazing, not too sweet, and the consistency is the same every time. The crust has cheese baked in. The slices are doughy but it all just works. I've traveled from the very top of Inwood on the subway down to Bensonhurst just because I was craving this pizza. Now I drive from Astoria. This pizza is the standard to which I will hold all other pizzas for life.ARE YOU LISTENING SPUMONI GARDEN??? I advertise your pizza all over the world--I should be eating for free :P",3/17/2016,86,74,7,aZhCOJrclQSsWeaZReyUbw
1040,Mitch B.,0,5,"Went on an unexpected, spontaneous pizza crawl in Brooklyn with my son a couple of weeks ago.  Finally found time to try the renowned DiFara's on Avenue J, home of the $6 slice.  Waited close to an hour for a few slices of a round pie (He wasn't doing squares that day) surrounded by a mix of hipsters and locals all agog over the pizza and watching (some filming) the old master ply his trade.   Okay.  I get it.   It's a cool experience and the pizza is really, really good.  Then why did both my son and I look at each other as we left and almost simultaneously say, ""let's go get some L&B squares.""    Twenty minutes later, after one bite of a square L&B slice from a fresh pie, my son and I looked at each other and again almost simultaneously said, ""Now that's great pizza!""   Wow.   I have admittedly been disappointed in L&B the last couple of times I was there. To the extent I thought its time had passed, I was wrong.  This was how I remembered it.  There is simply no comparison between an L&B square and any other pizza I have ever tasted anywhere, including DiFara.",4/2/2016Updated review,8,78,12,sS-bFI-qVwCkucjdPxYMbQ

1043,George L.,0,3,"Not my favorite slice... at all. It's a nostalgic place where we hung out back in high school, but the slice is overrated. If you grew up eating it and didn't know any better, you probably love it, but I grew up in a different neighborhood (down the street from DiFara actually) and this slice is too doughy and the sauce is too sweet. I like my sauce to be complex and tangy. The cheese they use is the shredded stuff out of the bag (probably Costco brand or something). However, the food in the restaurant (which unlike the pizzeria, is still owned by the original Italian family) is still fantastic. I definitely still go there.",5/17/2015,0,26,0,OY1jh5Yd4W9WAsn5fFDLOA

This restaurant is always so crowded thats how perfect they are! Seriously. What I love about it is that no matter how crowded it is as business is booming the pies are coming out the oven FRESH every 5 minutes! Customer pulls up boom ya got ya fresh pie straight out the oven! YOU WONT REGRET IT!! Service is great! Parking is okay, they have a parking lot, can get crowded!

1046,Erin W.,0,5,"One of my favorite places, ever! I can't speak for the restaurant part inside because I've never been but as far as the outside goes, it's a perfect place to come for pizza in the summer. It's nothing fancy outside, just a bunch of picnic-like tables and windows to order your food from.Everytime I've been it seems like a lot of families like to go there with their children which is nice. It's always busy! Now onto the pizza. The square slice is what is mainly ordered here and it does NOT disappoint. It's sort of like a pizza in reverse..the cheese first and then the sauce. It's different in an amazing way! Literally can never eat just one slice. The only bad thing about their pizza is that it'll make you never want to eat regular pizza again. Of course after the pizza there's no better way to end your meal than with their spumoni! Their spumoni is delicious, enough said! Overall this is a really great place to come for great pizza and spumoni, the environment is perfect for a nice summer day.",9/29/2017,3,34,0,cE_Te2yKZ495FRngdZMW-A

If you answered yes to either/both of those questions, there is NO place better for you than this place.This restaurant is considered a landmark in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Why?

1048,Marie G.,0,4,"Came to L & B Spumoni Gardens for the first time on the day before the 4th of July.  It was a decently warm day so we opted to sit inside.  There is ample seating outside  and inside as well.  Nothing fancy about the inside.  Plenty of servers that are always helping you and seeing how things are.  Had the fried calamari and fried zucchini sticks for the appetizer.  I must say, their marinara sauce for dipping is pretty tasty.  So were the zucchini sticks, which were matchstick thin.  The calamari was okay.  Nothing special.  The flour they used to dredge the calamari was petty bland.  They didn't throw any salt or pepper in it.  For the main course I got the Eggplant Sicilian.  Which is basically a few pieces of eggplant parmesan thrown on top of ziti.  It came as a huge portion and was very tasty.  Again, nothing to blow my socks off, but it was good.  Portions here are huge so you'll definitely be brown bagging left overs home.  Two people at my table were served their entrees at the same time and the other took about another 15-20 minutes to be served.  I found that odd since that other person ordered something much simpler than us.  Just a slice and a chicken hero.  Another thing that irked me is that I ordered an unsweetened iced tea and they brought me out a bottle of Pure Leaf tea.  Hmm...okay.  For dessert I got the vanilla spumoni in a small cup.  What they gave me was vanilla spumoni in a cone.  Ugh.  It was creamy and refreshing.  Good, but it didn't blow me away.  The prices are reasonable and I would come back again and try the pizza.  I'm not in a rush to come back but I would make the trek out.  The majority of the food was tasty.

It was delicious, but you only need 1-2 slices for the average person.We had the traditional spumoni ice cream to go after, which was great, although mine had a pistachio shell in it.Overall, its a nice spot to visit after a day at Coney Island.

1062,Meg H.,0,4,"Go for the square instead of the round slice.  The round slice tasted worse than the $1.00 slices that you get from random pizza joints.  Maybe because it had been out for some time and they didn't even care to heat it up prior to serving it? On the contrary, the square - OH MY!  It was served piping hot and the texture of the dough and crust, oh dear lord, have mercy on this pizza lover! The slice was doused with the perfect amount of sauce and topped with what I believed to be baked grated Parmesan cheese, which gave it a bit of a salty crunch. And the crust was crisp and crunchy.  All this goodness for $2.50!! If there is a heaven and I make it there, it would definitely consist of a square slice from here.They also have homemade ice cream, spumoni and creamsicle.  I had the pistachio spumoni, which was pretty good, but a little bit too sweet for me. And it didn't have cherries, which was kind of a bummer.  $3.50 for a large.",9/6/2014,773,255,1516,L5uRYpL9arVGueEetKjmpw

1082,Joyce C.,1,2,"2 Stars for the excellent pistachio spumoni. Where those ROASTED pistachios in there? The sicilian slice isn't bad either- if hot. Besides that, barely a star for the service, efficiency, cold food, and confusing and chaotic experience that it was. Maybe if we sat in the restaurant part, we would have gotten our simple order within 40 minutes and hot? or maybe not- definitely a lot less running around for a starved person at 8:00pm on a high-70's end of Summer Sunday night. Is this what you get for self-counter-service? It doesn't seem like their kitchen is fit to handle the full cramped dining room (with an additional baby's Christening party in the front part room), 8+ to go orders that inundate in 15 minutes waves, and phone orders! If we were smarter and less sugar-deprived, I would have gone to the pizza window towards the far left and ordered some carby things as ""appetizers."" Seeing there was some long line in front of the middle ice cream window, I headed to the awkward lobby/to-go counter/waiting area to order our entire dinner. The workers seemed pretty efficient, with all their sandwich fixings, broiler, and sauces in the front. Can I have 1 sicilian slice, 1 rice balls parmagian, the pear salad? (mixed greens, arugula, pear, pine nuts. a choice of: Goat/Feta/Provolone/Ricotta Salata) We don't have goat cheese. Okay. Our menu changed, they forgot to take that off, we don't have goat cheese or feta. We only have mozzarella, provolone, and ricotta salata. [Run back to my friends at the outside table]Okay, mozzarella. Can I have the grilled eggplant and zucchini hero? We don't have that one. Okay? We only have these up above it. [Run back]Can I have the eggplant parm hero? Okay, but it'll be 20 minutes. Okay, fine. Can I have a side of broccoli rabe? It's going to take 20 minutes. How about a small side? We only have 1 large size, it's not on the menu, but that's the only size we have. Okay, fine. [Run back] 5 or 10 minutes past..maybe we can just get some drinks to hold us over. [Go back to the To-Go counter]  A crowd shows up at the counter. I hang around, the workers look overwhelmed and/or expressionless, since this seems like a normal night for the confusing lobby/order/waiting area. I cannot seem to get a drink order in. Give up, [Go back] What seems like 5 more minutes past.  [Go back to the To-Go counter] Wait around, ask about my order, (not ready yet) see a salad in a container. He seems to not hear me ask about it, while trying to fill 2 other orders at once. Stand around for a futile few minutes. [Go back]Oh, did I tell you, Kardashian friend Jonathan Cheban was there? Sitting right at the table outside the front door. He watched me a few times as I walked back and forth desperately for food. No I wasn't trying to get your attention or autograph. A lady and a man, who seemed like the owners, were in and out greeting the locals, the celebrity, and the baby Christening guests, offering a cappuccino (in a REAL glass cup) to a guy (regular local) waiting for his hero. (me eyeing him and crying for food on the inside)A large steaming plate of Broccoli Rabe! with lemony oil and shiny garlic is  set behind the glass counter. Is that mine? Nope, yours isn't ready yet. It sits there all green and shiny (couldn't they make double the size- one for me?). Guy comes up to the counter: ""Can I have a sausage and broccoli rabe hero?"" Slices open a hero, throws a giant link of sausage in it, grabs half the rabe with tongs, stuffs it into the sandwich, foil wrap, hands it over. I stand there, staring at the half of rabe behind the glass. Is my order ready yet? Nope.[Go back]They're calling people's names on the loudspeaker, I realized that I didn't give them my name with the order [Go back to the To-Go counter] ""Can I just get the drinks to my order first?"" Sure..wait another minute while he fills 2 other orders. What did you want to drink? Ring up another order. Okay, what did you want? Can I just bring the salad to my ""niece"" first? Sorry, we have to wait for your whole order. Pay $42.FINALLY, I see a stack of tins. Worker goes behind to the left to grab a square slice for me. ""The Broccoli Rabe is still cooking."" Rice balls are COLD. The cheese congealed on top, in a FOIL TIN, seems like it cooled off 40 minute ago. There's minced beef & peas in the inside- not bad. Slice is cold- although dough fluffy crispy and sauce & cheese underneath taste nice. But It's Cold! Salad is dressed with a giant 1/2 lb of shredded cheese, sans a few pears. Eggplant hero alright. A few bites left, [Go back] We're still waiting on the Broccoli Rabe. Worker looks lost, goes to the side, Finally, hot rabe in a tin comes. At least it's hot I guess. It was actually pretty tasty. Eat some with the last 4 bites of my meal. Just go for the spumoni and leave quickly. I didn't eat enough to fulfill the calories that I burned walking back and forth.

As we sat down and munched away and saw more and more people come in, we saw that it's a very popular lunch spot for cops. Then we got a rainbow spumoni and some regular ice cream. Both were good.

1085,Xi L.,0,4,"Okay you come here because the tomato sauce they use is fantastic, which it is. It is certainly quality pizza when you buy by the slice even which means you cannot add toppings which is why I'm docking a star. If you get a half plan which means 12 slices of what is essentially a ""medium-large"" slice and its in sicilian form, its quite big...12 slices can feed 4 ppl  and with that order you can get toppings. But dam this pizza would be so legit with toppings for single slices as well. The crust is great, the cheese and sauce are spectacular as well.Also try the ice's. The oreo one is fantastic, just get the small size. You don't want to eat too much of it after pizza.",7/6/2016,333,485,184,WIFb-G9x9Z7uTF7hi-qQJw

1093,Rachel A.,1,4,"L & B Spumoni Gardens is like a beer garden but for pizza. The space is huge and open air with lots of picnic tables. It's nice that for some of these tables, they have umbrellas to shade you from the Summer heat. There is also a section in the back that is under a shade. Praise L & B because it is hot out there. Going to L & B Spumoni Gardens definitely feels like a Summer thing to do. People come out in droves after the beach. There is always a steady stream of customers but the lines come in waves. This is a family friendly atmosphere and a Brooklyn classic!We bought one square slice and cut it up into four pieces. They were perfect bites of dough. I would say that this pizza is an acquired taste or one that you just grow up with and know. But for me it just tasted raw. The real deal was the spumoni and Italian ice. There is a reason why L & B is called Spumoni Gardens!!! I loved the spumoni and I didn't think I would. It was a mixture of chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio Italian ice but it was mostly pistachio. The pistachio was a hideously fake Hulk colored green but it was so fierce! There were bits of roasted pistachios in it and it was just so good. Never tasted anything like it. L & B puts Rita and Ralph to shame. The other flavor we chose was pomegranate and it was also amazing. Together they even made a good pairing. The pomegranate ice was a great consistency. All it was missing was a little booze. Kidding, only kidding. But it was one step away from tasting like a frozen margarita.L & B Spumoni Gardens is just fun all around.

1094,Alli C.,0,3,"Been eating L&B's square slice for YEARS. It's always been very good, at least when eating it right at the pizzeria. The last two experiences (within the past 3 months) were so-so. Ordered some square slices to go from the outside counter - they were mostly overcooked,  and lacking in sauce/cheese. Their delivery has also been consistently slow (more than 45 mins, usually closer to an hour). Just last week, it took an hour for the pizza to arrive, and shockingly, the interior slices of the half-tray Sicilian pie were still RAW! I couldn't believe it. The cheese pulled right off of it and the dough was a mushy mess. This was the first time I've ever received raw pizza from them.The square pizza tastes excellent is usually cooked perfectly.

1095,Sooz A.,0,5,"L & B Spumoni's makes great Sicilian pizza. I came here with a group of friends and went to the pizzeria side (not the restaurant side). We shared a half pizza for $21. It was delicious. The cheese-to-sauce ratio is perfectly balanced for my tastes. The cheese is flavorful and not overwhelming. The sauce is amazingly tangy. Some people might not like the doughy bread, so the slices in the middle without crust can be overly doughy and soft. The slices touching crust are better. Getting to L & B Spumoni's is a journey, so make it a trip and check out that part of town while you're out there.",1/20/2016,376,527,568,ATpiatPltDVqVZmufeM-BA

The peach Italian ice was very refreshing. The pizza was very filling and could get in 2 squares before feeling extremely stuffed!The atmosphere is very casual. There is a separate section for ice cream and pizza. Even for pizza, there is a separate line for single squares and pies. If you get single squares, they are immediately ready to eat!

The problem with this place is that unless you know someone, dont go on a busy night apparently.Called for a reservation and I was told that they only take reservations for chef's table on weekends. Ok fair enough. Showed up at 630, place was buzzing, I was told 30 minutes, 90 minutes later after I had watched group after group of people who came after me, with no reservations, I got a table. If you dare ask the woman with the list how much longer, you are told nastily, that asking won't help. But apparently it does help the people who know her, because they will sit before you. I was also told that people who were seated ahead of me but came after me had "" reservations"" funny thing is they didn't order the chef's table, so that's a lie.

I mean, if we known sooner, or if we weren't all feeling hungry when ordering, could have thought about that. Each one of us barely finished our pasta, despite it tasting pretty good, actually. Their ices are also pretty good. A decent amount for the price, I'd say.My complaint, however, was the wait time. I felt like we waited forever for the food to come out.. I understand that this is a pretty popular and well-known place, especially busy, but nearly an hour waiting on food sucks.

1107,Jenn F.,0,3,"After overcoming the laziness to drive the 3 minutes it takes to get here, I finally took the plunge and ordered a Sicilian pie with pepperoni.  This is probably the most popular place in Brooklyn for pizza besides Di Fara.  I've been recommended L&B by several different people on several different occasions.  I think I just got tired of saying I never had it before.Quoted a 10 minute wait time on the phone, I arrived on a weekday night, went to the pie pick-up window, and waited behind a couple of folks.  Business was booming- there was a full outdoor area, a line to my left, a line to my right- everyone was waiting to eat this pizza!  Observation: people tipped at the window I was at.  I was a little surprised at this, considering the man was handing over the pre-packed boxes of pizza(towering boxes were literally sitting on the counter & ready to go; it seemed quite efficient).  Tipping was so expected that the guy actually paused to wait for change.  He did for me.  I suggest a tip jar instead of a seemingly 'obligatory' tip.The Sicilian pizza is naturally thick and has much dough- if you're more of a thin slice person, it's best not to order this type.  To me, the pizza was not as great as my hopes for it to be were.  Parts of my pizza were burnt, parts of the corner edges were charred and there were black striations on the bottom of the pizza.  The center slices were less cooked through as some reviewers already mentioned.The sauce was pretty decent- not too sour, just enough sweetness.  The shortcoming really pertained to the lack of cheese on top.  There was very little of it.  At the end of the day, though a Sicilian is really a deep dish pizza, it's also still a pizza.  And I like pizza with cheese; I felt I was eating a thick slice of toast with a less than generous sprinkle of cheese.To summarize, I'd come back to try a regular pie and the highly regarded spumoni; their Sicilian was just not for me.",7/25/2014,767,373,2548,CM8yTmvoIVlAnqvHsHlaIQ

1121,J.P. D.,0,4,"L & B's is a classic Brooklyn and classic NYC pizzeria. I come here a few times a year, primarily on the warmer seasons. On a nice day, L&B's is a great spot to enjoy the weather, sit on their distinctive outdoor red picnic tables, hangout and share a square pie with friends. To complete the experience after a few slices, homemade rainbow spumoni is mandatory. The thing to get here is their square (aka Sicilian) pizza. The difference is that the mozzarella cheese is under the sauce. The cheese acts as barrier between the sauce and crust. The crust is fluffy and light with a crunchy exterior. The sauce is bright and herby with a forward oregano flavor. The pizza is finished is Pecorino Romano and olive oil. The pizza is best when it comes straight out the oven. A delicious slice but not the absolute best. I still prefer DiFara's and Totonno's more but L&B's square slice is so unique, textually and flavor-wise. Their homemade ice cream is also delicious. I usually end my meal with their namesake Spumoni, pistachio, chocolate and vanilla Italian ice cream. I also enjoy their homemade tiramisu ice cream.",5/5/2015,493,38,33,z5s8n_CYZlWK8-GQDuazxQ
1122,Jia Yi S.,0,5,"For a pizza, I'd say it's pretty amazing. It doesn't matter if you order the pizza (round) or their Sicilian (square), both just have slightly different texture. Their Spumoni wasn't my thing. The ice cream had good texture, quite like a Gelato, but otherwise nothing special. Spumoni is basically an ice cream with nuts in it. What's great about their pizza: the bread, crust, cheese and sauce. Basically everything. Their sauce has a slightly authentic sour tomato taste to it that makes it so great and sets it apart from the rest. The bread was just right - not too tough or soft. I wouldn't make the trip down again, it's quite far from the city area (since I don't live in NYC); but I'd still say it's one of the best pizzas around.

1123,Cedes T.,0,3,"Cheese pizzas are the only pizzas for me. It's my way of comparing pizza parlors. And after having read rave reviews about L&B Spumoni Gardens, and knowing it's an landmark in the pizza landscape, I ventured out into Brooklyn to pay homage and to see and taste for myself.I just ordered a round pie slice of cheese pizza ($2.50) that wasn't even reheated upon placement of my order. I didn't see anyone making any pies, just someone slicing them. One thing that stuck with me was how, when I deposited money into the tip jar, the cashier shouted something like, ""Tip, guys!"", and I was met with a resounding cheer. I don't recall what it was they said but it sounded grateful, so I'm assuming it was a thanks of some kind. I found/find it a good practice.My pizza slice was well worth its price, for an establishment like L&B Spumoni. Very straightforward, nothing groundbreaking. The crust was chewy and wasn't oily , you could fold it properly, the mozzarella was fresh... But in effect, it was lackluster. I know of a hole-in-the-wall pizza parlor in the Bronx which has a similar- if not better- tasting version of cheese pizza.Would I go back? Not really.

When she called, she told them she needed it delivered for 12pm. They said our building had a few deliveries coming at 12:30 but she explained that this would be too late and we absolutely needed our pies by noon. They obliged and said they would do it (keep in mind that our job is literally down the street from spumoni, so it would be more than feasible for them to do deliveries at two different times).12pm came and went, and she called them to see where our pizza was. They lied and said it was on its way... 20 minutes later, still no pizza. We called yet again and at this point, I told them to not bother and that I would come pick it up.

The square slice is covered with a flavorful red sauce and a crispy, perfectly cooked crust. It was slightly burnt, just to my tasting and soft in all the right places. Don't stop there, the Spumoni Rainbow Icee is a great choice for dessert. It highlights the three spumoni flavors the joint makes; chocolate, white, and pistachio. It has this interesting cinnamon/nutmeg taste that enhances any Icee flavor.  The Rainbow provides a quite authentic, refreshing, yet creamy sweet party in your mouth after a delicious square slice.",7/29/2017,28,13,9,BUEJP6VD9GblXyQ9UemqBQ

1133,Aleksey F.,0,5,"Seems like there are pizzerias and Italian restaurants on every other block. However, this place beats anyone of them hands down. L&B is definitely more than a restaurant, it is a piece of Italian/American history and is an iconic establishment in the Brooklyn Community. It is certainly worth mentioning that this restaurant is consistently delicious. We order from there at least twice a month and have been doing so for the last several years and they never disappoint. Whatever you guys/gals do to make such delicious food, keep it up. You are GREAT!!!",7/6/2017,68,17,6,iDBPU7banG5cZRyKEO129w
1134,Jeremy P.,0,3,"Friends swear by this place, so I'm wondering if the quality may have fallen off recently.The square pie is doughy, imbalanced, and underwhelming.I've had ""tomato"" pies from other places and, while not my preference, I can appreciate the sauce on top approach. And the sauce is tasty... very sweet but also bright and flavorful.Unfortunately, the sauce is all this pie has going for it. The thin layer of mozzarella lacked punch (it felt cheap) and the dough was pillowy, somewhat bland, and just dominated every bite. I never expected a perfectly balanced pie here but if you're going to double down on sauce and dough, those components need to shine.Thankfully the spumoni was delicious and it was nice to be able to dine outside. I can see the charms and understand why (when the pizza was better?) this was a beloved destination. But the way it stands today it's tough to comprehend how L&B is mentioned alongside other top tier NYC pizzerias.",3/8/2018,74,6,0,vLktG7dLOOWnZCHlkB8VKA

To me thats the litmus test of a pizza place.With the exception of the icies, any Brooklyn pizzeria is as good, if not better,What really pissed me off is the other day i was in a mood for a Hawaiian pizza, thats where they add pineapple and ham to the slice. (I know, i had a craving.) Anyway, i ask the guy at the window for a Hawaiian slice, he says nah, we can only do that for a whole pie. A whole pie?!? Literaly any other pizzareia will customize a slice to order. Thats their bread and butter. Not this f'n place.I looked around, there were maybe two other people ordering pizza.

I appreciated the seperate lines for singles slices and full pies making the wait very quick. However,  not a fan.  The pie seemed slightly undercooked,  missing seasoning,  missing cheese,  too much sauce.  I probably should've stuck with my typical plain slice :/. The saving grace here was their ice cream.  We spilt a spumoni  on a cone and peanut butter split. Both very good options to say the least.  However coming from queens I won't be doing it again.  Sorry spumoni :/ cool back story though!",4/17/2016,16,177,84,16kli3vCVOaK6GPwhlWVPg

1149,Ana D.,1,5,"I will start off by saying that I do not generally eat pizza because I feel it's a ""waste of calories"" but I absolutely LOVE the sicilian pizza here. Once in a while I gladly surpass my calorie-limit basking in it's glory :) While the dough is heartier than regular pizza it is not dry. I love that it tastes and feels like the cheese has fused and become one with the dough making for a cheesy-bread with sauce versus the slippery individual layers of a typical pizza that can become deconstructed while eating. In addition, the pecorino romano cheese imparts a bite/kick that I really enjoy. To top it off, the sauce is thicker and more robust than other pizza sauces. This is by far my favorite pizza ever! Since the location is out of my way I like to freeze squares in portions so I can prolong my enjoyment- that is if I don't eat them all. Of note: The spumoni is also good but nothing to write home about like the sicilian slice which I can write poems, sonnets and love songs about :P",4/7/2016,7,128,245,r_WSWHqVyMve8dztgRHuBg

The outdoor seating is great when you can nab a seat, otherwise, you'll have to figure something else out.  The one thing i don't like, is the crazy double parking outside of the place.  L&B's has it's own parking lot, but most people decide they don't want to use it (beats me).  So every time i sit outside to have a slice, i witness at least one near, car accident due to illegal U turns and  double parking.  If you're driving, be careful.",5/28/2014,152,268,1367,OUt5Oe03BfSsOt-pPpb9Yg

We ordered and sat outdoors in the picnic tables section, and we came for the Sicilian pizzas but also had arancinis and a meatball sub - so much red sauce! - plus the rainbow spumoni. The pizzas were kind of doughy and heavy, not as crispy of a crust, but the cheese and sauce were good. The sub, not so much, but the surprise were the rice balls - filled with peas and chopped meat, topped with more red sauce and melted cheese. They were a bit underdone in the middle, but the effect of the mushy rice, sauce, and cheese was a savory comfort. The spumoni, there's no pistachio in the world with this color, but at least I had some green in my food.I wouldn't make a special trek out, but it's casual and can be a fun summer atmosphere with friends or family.",7/10/2014,53,91,27,E4pc8hmKLPLmxX-iQYTi4A

It is a hybrid. Is it a Sicilian, marinara or grandma slice? It seems to possess the attributes of all three. The sauce was quite good. The mozzarella, which is applied in a thinly layered slice across the surface of the slice, and which hides under the sauce, is okay. The dough is... doughy ... too much so in my opinion. I like the sprinkle of parmesan across the top. Gives the slice a little extra tang. The place has a cult following, but I am not drinking the Cool Aid.P.S., you guys should send a spy to Rosa's of Maspeth. They copied your pizza.

It is broken up into 4 areas: the main restaurant, takeout window with seating outside, spumoni and Italian ices, and pizza. The penne alla vodka, chicken entrees, and sandwiches are excellent. However, the best part of L&B is the spumonis and Italian ices. They are the best I have tried anywhere. The square pizza is also awesome and may be the best I have ever eaten. However, eat it hot because it does not hold up well over night.

Everyone that is working is at 120% working overtime. You can tell it hurts their performance, running around with 30lbs of food, answering questions, and singing the 4th happy birthday song.. they're easily ticked by the end of the night. They're understaffed and it's apparent in their attitude. Why risk giving them animosity towards you when you can just order their namesake pizza and ice cream at the takeout? Do that instead. Cause the dine in food taste like any pizzeria take out out. Trust me, it's not La Nonna di Napoli working in the back plucking basil plants, letting the pot simmer. Its more ""si, fly"".  Also, You'll be crammed in elbow to elbow in a room out of a 70s Al Pacino movie.",11/12/2015,45,180,53,_gNdfL4qrkmseY2RS5DiIg

The pizza area has only a few seats inside but there are a bunch of tables outside. Anyway, the square slice is great and I'm very picky about pizza. It's really nice and light. The sauce is excellent. I also got a sausage and pepper hero and that was top notch as well",4/16/2017,14,234,1,ALECJkq8ZTF38zZBZt1ESA
1191,Richard P.,0,5,"Took a trip out to Brooklyn to show my gf's and sister-in-law (both from Texas) what real New York pizza is about!  Actually, it was also my first time at Spumoni's so I was techniquely taking a huge gamble.  With some advice and reviews from my italian friends, I knew the risk was worth the reward.  Sunday afternoon and it was not packed with decent parking spots across the street.Food:  We ordered both the round and their famous sicilian pie.  Their round pie was delicious typical NY pizza.  Very thin with a nice bottom crust.  Their sauce was outstanding with a generous amount of cheese still melting on top.  My favorite was their Sicilian of course.  Crusty on the bottom, yet soft and buttery in the middle.  The sauce that I loved so much was just layered beautifully on top.  After the first bite, I knew it was already worth it.  Good call Rich... good call.Now whats better than their Sicilian slice?  Leftover, and rebaked.  Wow.  JUST WOW!  Make sure you get some to go to try it out!  Just out of this world.  Next time I'm back there, I'll have a good at their ice.  Heard they're out of this world.  Enjoy!",4/23/2014,634,84,116,eOnxWeYYHVpgTMHe-GOyaw

1194,Leo K.,0,3,"I know I am one of the only people in Brooklyn who is not the biggest fan of this place, but I'm okay with being that guy. The true test is that I live a few blocks from here and I have no inclination to visit often, even though I have been coming here since I was a kid.Yes the pizza is unique and yes this is a great place to hang out in the summer, but to say this is the best Sicilian pizza is not fair to all the amazing Sicilian slices I have had at other places.I am also one of the few who prefers their round slices versus their square slices.The reason I don't love the square slice here, is it reminds of Chicago deep dish, not a lot of cheese, thick dough, okay sauce, and more reminiscent of cheesy bread.On a side note the spumoni Ice cream here is 5 stars for sure, it's creamy and perfect and has tons of flavor.Is this place worth a visit, absolutely, is it worth traveling far for this place, I would say no.",5/24/2014,240,443,483,dbOh1k-qlVl3zDz4yjuriw
1195,Alexandra R.,0,5,"Best Sicilian slice ever!! Spumoni Gardens is a must-try for any pizza fan. The bread is perfectly chewy and the crust is bar none. The cheese melts into the bread to form an unbelievable and unique texture. The sauce is on top of the cheese it is deeply layered with flavor and a little sweet. There is nothing I dislike about this pizza. I have only ever gone to the pizza parlor, and not the attached restaurant, but the restaurant has a line out the door at night so I assumed it also fantastic. The Spumoni dessert is also a favorite of mine. It is best enjoyed outside on a warm summer day. Spumoni Gardens has an old school Brooklyn feel that is hard to find.

I just don't recall them being like that a few years ago,6/15/2017,257,13,0,J_7zQMl6gGR5w-UMhnqRSA
1202,Kevin E.,1,4,"On the last day of my rotation at the CVS on 18th Ave/New Utrecht, my preceptor got us L&B's Sicilian squares and they were amazing!! I normally don't rate pizza places because all pizza tastes the same to me (if they have the same toppings that is haha) but L&B's Sicilian squares just left such a big impression on me that I had to rate this place! They cook the squares so that the center is a little undercooked so that it's chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! YUM! I gobbled down 2 squares with no problem and also swiped one to bring home for later but, being the clumsy oaf that I am, it dropped on the floor while I was walking home :( Don't worry, I'll be back L&B!!!",8/27/2014,35,614,979,6n4zKJJFjWWo5nUDs0b-KA

1206,Vivienne G.,0,5,"I have put off writing this review because there are some places that are just so hallowed that even the thought of writing about all the reasons to love them becomes a daunting process. First, get the square slice. The square slice is a thing of beauty. For the people who had a bad square slice experience here, I don't know what to say. The square slice here is usually baked to perfection. The crust achieves that perfect crunchy-on-the-outside-and-perfectly-chewy-when-bitten consistency. The sauce recipe is probably a well-guarded secret since this is easily the best sauce I have had on any pizza slice in NYC (and I have had a LOT of pizza here in the three decades I have lived in NYC). The cheese is melted under the sauce and marries itself to the crust.What you get is a symphony of pizza flavors that (when done right) will leave you wondering how you will ever consume a slice from anywhere else again. Now, about the spumoni. The spumoni is best enjoyed during NYC's dog days of summer. Get the pistachio-mixed. Trust me on this. It's a brilliant layering of flavors with just the right amount of crunch and creamy goodness. L&B is an NYC institution.",11/26/2013,45,39,34,myY0sPrFP_CljcVBbotycQ

1215,Christie S.,0,5,"Ahhhh the memories alone make this a 5* review. The Za and ice back it up. Hardcore! Four generations of my family have devoured the delectable Sicilian pies, and had buckets of Italian Ice at this Bensonhurst landmark. It was one of the first places my cousins and I were allowed to walk ""up the Avenue"" to while visiting Nonna; back in the days when kids could walk places safely. It is everything I miss about New York: real, simple, never changing, proud and authentic. Most rookies make the mistake of ordering the large Sicilian Pie and realize their eyes are bigger than their stomachs. For more then 70 years they have been serving up a righteous Pie and Spumoni (and a wide variety of other flavors) Italian Ice you just can't get outside the confines of NYC.Some go for the hype (which it blows away) others for the memories...sensory are indeed the strongest. It is the kind of place you go out of your way for, just for food you can't get anywhere else. In my book, if you are going to blow a carb wad, it should be on extraordinary food: L & B is that and more. Just go. Worth a subway trip, taxi ride, walk or drive: it is a true gem!Note: the cheese on the Sicilian is served under the sauce; the way most Nona's learned to make in Sicily. This is the only pie I don't order well done and is truly different from most others stateside. For some, this is good, for others: not so much.

Over the weekend I went to L&B with a friend to grab a slice of pizza.Although there was a parking lot right next to the premise it was full, but we were able to get a parking spot nearby. Initially, the line was long AND for good reason. I had a fresh square slice and it was just the perfect amount of cheese to sauce to crust ratio. We both sat outside at a small table and enjoyed eating our slices in the amazing weather. We contemplated getting icees, which are also sold there and ultimately decided not to.I would love to go back for another slice and to try some of their authentic Italian dishes.",8/10/2014Previous review,981,598,362,zONGOlUlk65vMtuS_eE4jg

I've never had the ices, but I have had their ""grandma"" slice -- which, if I'm not mistaken -- is a square slice (or Sicilian) that has the cheese underneath the pizza sauce. Some might yell blasphemy at the prose that follows, but I honestly don't think their pizza is anything special. In my opinion, it's overrated. Seriously. It was just okay. Maybe I came on an off day; maybe not. Maybe people wouldn't know what a good slice of pizza is, if a pie hit them in their face. Don't believe me?

As someone who grew up with NJ Italian food, this hit the spot for me when I was craving the terrible food of my childhood.I understand why kids like it so much - the food is bland, soaked in cheese, and served with a mountain of spongy white bread. It's been so long since I've been served those little pre-packaged diner style butters and creamers.The pizza is some sort of unholy combination of Chicago deep dish and someone's idea of what Sicilian pizza is like. If it's square it's authentic, right?Go for the experience and the time warp. Don't go for the food unless this is what your mom cooked for you.",3/17/2014,116,422,19,iquCZU8tjmRQrnDgci5YpQ
1222,J S.,0,4,"Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the only things I've ever had are the Sicilian pizza and the Spumoni. There is a full service restaurant attached to the pizzeria but, for me, the pizza is worth the pilgrimage from my home, about 40 miles away. Crisp golden crust and a reasonably thick and chewy center with sauce, cheese, and more sauce on top. Don't know specific ingredients but I totally get why this place is on every NY Best Slice list ever written. Brought   A pie home and froze the individual slices, they heat up perfectly any time. Also nice to drive 4 miles to visit Coney Island but if you crave a ride on the  Cyclone, you might want to go for the pizza AFTER the ride!",4/24/2016,0,40,2,wigj8FWurVcu7dx-my1_XQ

There was a lot more Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and some slices barely had any sauce. All the extra cheese made the pizza so unbearably salty. The crusts were also entirely burnt so I had to eat around it.We have so many slices left over.. Wish I would've known that the squares aren't what they used to be.. Wouldn't have gotten 12 slices!

1246,Christina L.,0,4,"This place has overall great food but there's a reason that it's known for the square pie and the Spumoni. I highly recommend that if you come here that is what you get. It's definitely the best pizza in Brooklyn and quite possibly the best pizza I've had. The spumoni is delicious as well and you need to eat it if you come here. The place has a friendly feel and you always feel like family. The one complaint that I have is that the pizza is on the expensive side (half a pie, 12 slices, is 21 dollars). Other than that if you ever find yourself in the area you need to make the stop it is definitely worth it",9/27/2016,37,142,79,yXhsuwDpKVD2vPdT3H5qow

1255,Jennifer N.,0,2,I heard about Spumoni from my boyfriend and since we lived literally a block away I figured I'd give it a try and order a pie to see what everybody was raving about. I called for an order of a large cheese pie and asked for delivery. I literally waited over an hour to get the pizza delivered and I live a block away!! Pizza tasted standard and I was not blown away and the pizza sauce is a bit on the sweet side. Won't order from here again.,10/24/2016,34,109,36,xrDBP8eP953JKyEef78LPA
1256,Ingrid S.,1,5,"The first time I came to Spumoni was after a back laboring day of moving me out of Bayridge and into Kensington last year. Somehow it turned into a day of drinking in the back of a u-haul truck and then later a pizza party. The second time I ended up here was after and during a complete emotional mid-life crisis breakdown where we sat and discussed in one of those monumental life conversations what 'is the meaning of happiness'. From pizza to spumoni there are little things every day that make life slightly better and often we forget to enjoy them. Anyway, I like this place because it carries a story and it makes for a great story probably with everyone. Also, this is the only style of pizza that Michigan oddly makes well. ""Buddy's Pizza"", for if you ever end up in the Detroit area. Thick cut square slice with the sauce on top of the cheese. It's startlingly similar. I was here this weekend because one of my friends likes to have an annual pizza crawl across Bklyn and he decided to start here. Though, if he weren't 45 minutes late it would have been even more awesome. Though the people watching is pretty much as fantastic as the pizza. I saw kids rapping about pizza and making a home-made film project. The only thing I find questionable is the neon green food coloring in the pistachio spumoni icee which I can't still quite figure out whether its ice cream or italian icee or gelato or some weird combination of all three. It's still new to me.",9/2/2013,859,1421,11813,vXAUaZSn7reLfjLk73MeeA

After a long wait we got water and after another long wait our waiter took our order. We never talked to him again until the check. They are so under staffed and they walk with blinders on so we can't be helped. I have been here many times over the years and it's almost always the same. The food is good although not the portions you got in the past. The lady at the door has no personality and seems to have a scowl. A smile and a greeting would be nice.

1266,Victoria X.,1,4,"I personally prefer Sicilian slices over regular slices and this place is known for their Sicilian slices so that was exciting. This place was two blocks away from the N train - 86th street stop so it was easy to find. Slices are $2.50 each or $20 for a box of 12. What I like most about the slices was that it was the perfect sauce to cheese taste ratio. I ended up eating three slices, probably could of ate more but I knew if I drank a bit of liquid, that's it; I would be so bloated for the rest of the night. They offer limited indoor seating, unless you're looking for an actual dining experience which they offer. There is plenty outdoor seating, which I recommend on a nice sunny day or a cool evening night. This place is the best of both worlds because they offer you dinner & dessert all at the same spot. They also sell homemade icee, spumoni & ice cream. I got the pistachio spumoni and I got bits and pieces of pistachio throughout my treat. What's even better is that they have their own parking lot and they're open until midnight, win.",4/16/2017,603,632,623,Rmj6vECY7lB-LDXLRqYpBg
1267,Nadia D.,0,3,I was so excited to try L&B Spumoni but sadly I think it is overrated. My 3 stars is just for the service (which was great). Now I am more of a traditional pizza type of girl as I enjoy a nice plain pizzeria slice. I enjoy a Sicilian once in a while but I'm super picky about it. And this place is known for their Sicilian. Personally I felt that the pizza was too saucy and it didn't sit well with my stomach 2 hours later. I will not be going back as it is overhyped,4/28/2014,0,24,25,W6V31Q6BOFKYmUYZXp8yZQ
1268,Jacky R.,0,3,"This is honestly an overhyped pizza joint. Maybe 40 years ago this was the best family owned pizza joint but now this spot is crazy packed with tourists, huge families, and students trying to get a cheap bite at night. This spot stays crowded even after 12am but the pizza really isn't that great... The marinara sauce is probably the best part since it's pretty flavorful and sweet. But the thing is the cheese and the crust is lacking and for the hype, it's not worth the price and wait. It's definitely not bad pizza tho. Just not as good as everyone claims.",3/14/2017,288,46,102,6i8IamhpWETkyeMUboCboQ
1269,Zach W.,0,5,"You know when you're trying to put yourself in the mindset of the pilgrims, and you try to end up in a far away, isolated place but accidentally find an already populated country, full of pizza? That's what finding L&B is like.It's way out of the way unless you already live there, in which case you already know how good it is, so why are you reading the review? For everyone else, you end up in a very un-Manhattan-feeling neighborhood and discover the pizza Plymouth rock. I've thought long and hard about this and I THINK that it's my 3rd-favorite pizza place in New York, but it would probably depend on the day, because it's unbelievable. Just absolutely delicious. The square slices are the perfect combination of dough, sauce, and cheese, and butter probably, because nothing can taste this good without cheating. I don't want to overwhelm such a simple concept with too many words, so I'll just say that you should definitely get the pizza, and you should definitely not overthink it and get something else. Just sit back, eat some pizza, and celebrate Thanksgiving the old fashioned way - with some slices from L&B. You won't regret it!",8/11/2015,41,163,253,mPeVEdrwphqL0jfm0oU4bQ
1270,Rehana A.,0,3,"I am a huge fan of pizza. I can't get enough of pizza. It's funny because I am writing this review waiting on my pizza from a different place. Ok let's start with arriving at the location. You probably will need a car because I live in Queens and I will be  damned if I had to take public transportation to come here. Parking is awful because it's only  street parking,so good luck.      My boyfriend was super excited and raving  about the pizza.  I trusted his pizza palate and was look forward to an amazing experience. We stood in line, which seemed long and out the door. However, it was moving quite fast.  The line was only for regular slice and or Sicilian slice. For some reason you weren't allowed to order any toppings on the pizza waiting on this line. I think you have to get on another line for that.        Now for the decor of the place. The place is separated into to three different sections. One for pizza, spumoni and the last section of sandwiches.  You have great outdoor seating which adds on to the experience.        Me and my boyfriend  each got a regular and a Sicilian slice. I must say the regular slice was great. It didn't have the "" ton of dough"" and no cheese taste. The sauce was slightly sweet and tangy which complimented the cheese beautifully.  Even after the slice was done I was memorized by the taste. The crust was not too crunchy but soft and lightly crispy.    Now for the Sicilian slice.... hummm I am not too happy report I did not like or care for it. I actually regretted this choice. I think that slice was nothing but dough . So much carbs you could probably skip two days without eating any. There was no taste, just dough ... pure dough. I was super excited about the Sicilian slice because from what I heard that's what this place was renowned for. I don't want to criticize the taste of great pizza establishment but it was pretty bad. I am hoping may be it was  only that day. I didn't taste the cheese or the sauce. The whole experience  my palate was yearning for was disappointing.   I might just go back to redeem this place but will be only getting one Sicilian slice for both us. I just don't want to have repeat of extreme dough like last time.",8/10/2015,1148,148,40,1kbJit2p6CtD5OEL5ELHCw

No wait... it could also be the dough as it holds the sauce and cheese together through thick and thin without spilling a drop leaving no sauce behind to be gobbled up. But this place does not only OWN the pizza market but also their famous Spumoni Pistachio Mix. It's frozen when you get it but melts quickly in your mouth and you can taste all the flavors.

I have had so many versions of this around the city that compared pretty well to the amazingness that I am used to from Rosa's. I assumed this must have been where it originated and that it would taste similar.  I was sadly mistaken. This pie did not have the robust flavor that I've found it to have at other places. It wasn't particularly flavorful at all and tasted sort of doughy. The crust itself was also too doughy. I feel like it tastes better when it's more crisp throughout.

Maybe it was just an off batch/day, but nothing to stand in their really inefficient pickup vs slice vs ice cream lines, even when you called in your order. For the amount of good reviews and general fanfare this place gets, we tried to give it another chance with their cheese pizza and it was dripping with oil and was in general just a meh slice. Nothing horrible but nothing amazing. Still can't find a comparable square to Prince Street Pizza.",10/8/2017,3,13,3,DDI4n60BI28Ei4sRJZrerg

Pizza - pretty good, the crust was a little too thick for my liking.  The sauce and cheese were delicious. Penne - pretty good too!Best part of the night?  Our waiter brought us a complimentary 3 scoop spumoni dessert.   How sweet of him!  And it was yummy!",8/10/2011,119,950,1474,4ENBFSuIT-8vfRHZysQHag

1305,Virginia Y.,0,2,"6 years later and I'm still not blown away by their pizza. Sicilian is definitely the better slice compared to their regular round slices. The round slice was kind of bland, the cheese was eh and there wasn't really any sauce or flavor.Since I haven't had other flavors, I vowed for the rainbow one which includes, vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. It was terrible. The pistachio tasted incredibly artificial and sugary. Real pistachio isn't like this. Even the almonds tasted fake. The chocolate was bad as well, again very fake it tasted like they used hot chocolate powder to make it. The only flavor that was passable was the vanilla. My 5 year old cousin tried some of it and hated it as well, he took two bites and gave it to me and said he didn't want it anymore. Here's the convo: Me: Why don't you want the spumoni? Cousin: It's not yummy. Me: Why isn't it yummy?Cousin: It's not good.Me: What's not good?Cousin: The green stuff, tastes yucky.There you have it folks, if a 5 year old can hate spumoni, that's gotta say something right? After all their taste buds are more sensitive to taste and they're the world's pickiest eaters.The only thing that can possibly redeem this place is the sicilian slice, otherwise skip it. This place does not live up to its hype.",4/22/2015Updated review,1598,1443,4568,ntJ0mR5D4JqJOzsYZV-cxw

I can definitely see this place getting absolutely swamped during the day, but my friend and I decided to finally try this place out late on a Saturday night. Virtually no lines and we were easily able to grab some seats.I got a round and a square slice. I'm not really a big fan of Sicilian pizza (too much dough for me), but I thought this was very tasty. I was, however, blown away with how good the round slice was. Honestly, it was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had, and I've lived in NYC for most of my life.After my pizza was consumed, I had a small spumoni, which was delicious. My review will merely echo the thoughts and sentiments of like-minded individuals, so all I can tell you, reader, is that you simply must try this place out for yourself.",8/17/2009Previous review,246,747,414,B8REbpM6KwNizD-TW1zQFw

If people aren't stacked up waiting to get in, I don't want to eat there. Grabbed a couple slices while we were waiting, amazing Sicilian and regular pizza. Finally sat. Waiters were out of this world friendly, treated us like we were regulars. Food was incredible and we tried a little of everything. And topped it all off with a huge Frankenstein concoction of a dessert that made me want to throw a rock at my mama. Go here. Seriously.

Their Sicilian slices are so delicious and fluffy. It's thick, yet soft with a good amount of sauce on top. I normally do not eat the crust of a pizza, BUT their crust is sooo crunchy that I would eat it without second thoughts. This place is my go-to for pizza whenever I want pizza since it is open till late night. Their spumoni is a must try as well! They're just as delicious! There are very limited seating inside; however, there are a lot of seats outside so you can sit outside and eat enjoy your pizza in the spring/summer. They also have their own parking lot next to restaurant so you don't have to circle around to find parking.

We got mushrooms, Italian sausage and pepperoni and MAYBE the last two were high class items that could have cost that much but the mushrooms, a can is probably $1.00. The taste of the pizza was decent to good but I was super hungry so I might have thought anything was good.

Besides the really good *square* slices, L&B has a few other things going for it.1) it has a parking lot.  for those who have a car- you know this is golden!2) there were so many people ordering but we didn't seem to wait longer than a couple minutes for our slices.3) there are a ton of tables outside.  Perfect for spring/summer/fall eatin'.4) the guy who took my order was awesome.  The reason I say this?  he was totally old school Italian  and when I walked up to the counter he smiled and said ""what'll I get ya sweetheart?""  Gotta love that.So, whats the reason for my 4-star instead of 5?  I got a end slice... and it was really burnt.  Who likes burnt crust?  I missed out on a 1/4 of my pizza slice. :-(  Maybe next time I'll ask for a middle slice?  Or sit and wait for a non-burnt pie.  and the dude behind the counter will say: ""Hey no problem sweetheart, whatever you want"".  :-)",2/15/2017,662,1128,2878,Y3cmLx7y7x0fhSuIcWnvPw

I literally realized this on our last visit! It does make a difference in the taste and it really is good. I can understand why I wasn't totally 5 stars for this place, since a plain slice and a sicilian slice are totally different.  This slice though. You need to let it marinate for a bit to really appreciate the flavors. The sauce is sweet with the flavor of the cheese underneath.

I didn't see anything special about it other than the fact that it was a square pizza and it was really thick. Taste-wise, it was kind of bland.. my response wasn't ""omg this is amazing."" (To be honest, pizza from Papa John's and Pizza Hut tasted better). It is an experience so visit if you're in the area; but, I don't see a reason to come all the way here to have pizza (the area didn't seem very safe either).",6/20/2015,173,143,361,e8pTNjl-RZp7u2lTFlN-dA

I've found my dream slice: THE SICILLIAN SLICE AT L&B. The slice I had was fresh out of the oven and the crust was crisp where it needed to be and fluffy on the inside. The best part, however, was the SAUCE. The slice had the perfect amount and it had a super tasty, old school Italian flavor. There was not too much cheese which made it even more delectable. The rainbow spumoni was the perfect finale to this most delicious slice of pizza. Best slice I've had in the 7 years I've lived in NYC.Also, the outdoor seating and right off of Ocean Pkwy (which has a great bike lane) make it a great place to ride your bike and have a lovely outdoor lunch.",7/16/2015,13,25,2,NeXMpORmISbWlnJ7FKr-6Q

The thing about L & B's that stands out is that you don't come here for your average slice. You come for a Sicilian slice, a square. A crunchy on the bottom, but gooey-saucey-cheesy on top, bite from heaven. And 20 balloons (bucks, dollars, however you want to call money) for half a tray is a steal if you ask me. You never leave L & B's hungry.

1361,Lesley O.,1,3,"I've always heard how amazing L & B Spumoni Gardens is & how it's the staple for Brooklyn pizza so when I was in the area with my friend on Friday night, she had to take me. We were sat right away & greeted by a really friendly & handsome server ;) I knew I wanted to try the square pizza that everyone raves about, but I really wanted Italian food so I opted to take a slice of square pizza to go after we ate. We ordered a Ceaser Salad & Fettucini Alfredo to share for dinner & Fried Calamari to start with as an appetizer. I hadn't had a cream sauce in a long time & the fact that the Alfredo is served with prosciutto & my pregnant friend's eyes lit up when I suggested it, I knew we had to order it. In hind sight, I should have suggested we order something else because it wasn't great. I mean, it was edible but it definitely was not anything to be excited about. The fettucini seemed more like linguini in size & the cream sauce was very liquidy without much flavor. I guess I'm used to Alfredo sauces which are thicker in consistency & have more cheese. The Ceaser salad was also nothing to write home about. To be honest, the salad at Wendy's has more flavor. Another dish that was pretty dry & it tasted only like lettuce with a ton of Parmesan flavoring. There was dressing but it seemed more like a paste of cheese. It was ok just nothing special & definitely not worth the money. The calamari appetizer was the best of three items we ordered but I am not a fan of their sauce whatsoever. It has no consistency at all & is pretty tangy & sauce like that just gives me agida. There was absolutely no salt whatsoever either & I actually added salt to the calamari which is something I have literally never done in my entire life! The desert we ordered because we simply just had to was pretty outrageous though & I will give credit where credit is due because the tartufo, Spumoni, & ice cream were all creamy & delicious. Ok, the pizza. Oy vey. I do not understand what the hype is about. It's a square slice with tangy sauce & a tad bit of Parmesan on top. I heated it until the crust was burnt & there was still literally no way of getting the pizza crisp even in the slightest. It tastes pretty similar to a thicker Ellio's frozen pizza to be quite honest & I just don't get why people say this is THE place to go to. I don't agree. Yes, the service was awesome. Yes, the dessert is great. I'll even admit that after seeing a pic of the Rigatoni Bolognese on Yelp after we ate & wish I would have ordered that instead, this restaurant is way overrated. I'll stop in again when in the neighborhood for an ice or something but other than that, I will still stand by favorite Italian restaurant in NY & that is Mama Theresas. Nothing beats it anywhere.

I can take down a half-tray by myself and still not be satisfied, not because it's not filling but because it's just too damn good.

It was pretty crowded when we got there at around 10pm but finding a spot in the outdoor area was pretty easy. Next time, would try the restaurant/waited area inside.

My family and I have visited this place since I can remember, and now that I live close, I can visit more often. Previous to my most recent visit, I had only ever ordered from the window, and would almost always only get the spumoni. The spumoni is terrific, but it is a bit lighter than normal spumoni. It's sort of like a cream-ice, if that makes any sense. It lacks the creamy thickness indicative of typical ice cream or gelato. But it is marvelous. It's a great feeling when some things are just as wonderful as they were as you remembered them as a child. The vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio flavors are swirled together and produce magic.It's all downhill from there. This trip, we ate inside the restaurant. The service was shoddy. The sicilian pizza was ok, not great, a bit under cooked. The calamari was a bit bland, but ok with lemon and marinara sauce(points for bringing it without having to ask). The pear salad was actually quite tasty. Not cheap, so be prepared for that.I had the regular round pizza in the past that I remember being very good.

This place is an assembly line of workers collecting money, others making pizza and the rest handing them back to customers. I also was not expecting so much out door seating and that many people.  I underestimated the greatness. I was immediately told to sit down and enjoy as we ordered a half tray (12 slices) of their infamous Sicilian pizza. Being there were 4 of us we each had 3 slices (for those that suck at Math). The pizza is a perfect combination of dough, cheese and sauce. The dough is not too thin and not too thick. Perfect amount of crunchiness. The sauce was amazing...and who doesn't love cheese?

One thing stands out to me though, and it's the use of too much dough, and not springing for high quality herbs, and instead relying on very bad quality dry oregano. It makes the pizza almost difficult to digest, but even more importantly, there's something to be said for their lack of customer service and rude attitude.Try it once and develop your opinion, but definitely have your money ready when you're about to order.

There's no garden in evidence though, just an expanse of concrete with industrial picnic tables crowded with happy families. The complex includes two takeout stations: one for pizza and the other for spumoni, ices and other ice creams. There's also a sit down restaurant, with a selection of pastas and appetizers and main dishes. We split up, and I headed for the pizza window (made famous by a series of videos from the Jimmy Kimmel show that can be found on YouTube). The only choice is square Sicilian or slice of round. My friend rounded up two cups of Spumoni. The pizza was hot and fresh and tasty, but actually improved as leftovers reheated later. The spumoni is American style ice cream - not gelato - with chunks of pistachios laced through the vivid green, white and brown swirl. Better than the food is the people watching. Multi-generational family groups, lavishly tattooed couples, elderly men, and lots of children. Everyone united in their love for pizza and ice cream. No wonder L&B has been in business since 1938.

Yes, for goodness sakes, try the spumoni!!!!!!As far as the staff, they do their job and do it well.  You're in brooklyn, know what you want before you get to the window!!!!  When ordering pizza, remember the ""square"" or ""round"" terminology.  And for goodness sakes, don't ask ""what's that""...........",10/26/2014,60,75,30,h5jwChJOalClfR2Ai0NaWg

I had to go out of my way just to go here but I decided to go for it because everyone said it was great and I wanted to judge for myself.Ices: I think I enjoyed the ices more than the pizza itself.

Soft and savory and oh so yummy, a fluffy bready pizza. Don't wait to eat it, once it gets cold it's isn't as good.The Spumoni was underwhelming, it tasted artificial and wasn't all that good considering all the hype over it. The texture is in between ice cream and a icy. I would much rather have an ice cream or gelato.This place gets crowded in the warmer months, to the point that it's difficult to get a seat in the summertime. Their window service for pizza and Spumoni is pretty fast. The outside seating area isn't all that clean but considering the high traffic of people coming in and out, litter, and the occasional pigeon, it's decent. Reminds me of a school lunch room but placed in the school yard.Really disappointed that they do not allow dogs in their outside picnic setting area or even just to let people order from their outdoor window while having their dog by their side.

1457,Andrew F.,1,4,"Square slice, square slice, square slice.This place has the best sicilian (square slice) pizza i've ever tasted. Just absolutely delectable. they only sell it as take out but they have tables to eat at and most importantly they only serve it plain (unless you want to buy a half tray or full tray). Even with just mozzarella, bread and sauce it still posesses a depth of flavor you wouldn't expect, something better than what you'd get with most sicilian places and most slice shops. The service is curt, kind of like ordering at Pat's in Philly for cheesesteaks. You better know what you are going to order. Also this place only accepts cash, but don't worry they're ready to make change if all you have are big bills.I came here as part of a large group, but it was so good I'll likely be back on my own sometime soon.",6/1/2013,181,354,219,4XxQSlRLhECpr9rcOcc6rA
1458,Jin Y.,0,4,"The question is, is the Sicilian slice that good that I would come all the way to a neighborhood I rarely or if ever go to? No they are not worth the trip or going out the way, I mean its just pizza. However, if you happen to be in the neighbor it's definitely worth checking out. I prefer the regular slice, but their Sicilian slice is the best I've had. The crust is thick, soft, and chewy with the right amount of cheese and tomato sauce. This is a great spot for the summer because there is tons of outdooring seating.  And the spumoni* here is a must try. Perfect treat after your meal and there are so many flavors!___________* Italian ice cream made with layers of different colors and flavors",10/30/2012,6,732,2395,AWCY8laHjH0-3HMT0LGpUA

1460,Tom M.,0,5,"One of my Favorite Brooklyn spots. L&B can be broken down into four parts.1. Its a pizza parlor. The Sicilian slice is delicious. This is the slice they are famous for. The cheese is underneath and the sauce is on top. The regular slice is good to.2. L&B serves spumoni, ice cream and ices. Love the spumoni...vanilla, chocolate and pistachio...in case you did not know what spumoni is.3. They have a counter where you can get take out sandwiches and dinners.4. L&B is also a full service restaurant. I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed it. It is usually loud and crowded.They also have picnic benches set up outside, so you can eat out when the weather is nice.I enjoy this place. And yea, Adam Richman, AKA Man v Food, was here, but I liked it before I even knew who he was.",9/14/2012,391,617,387,i3iYZMTxDoobkRS7pdxS4Q

1462,Elaine G.,0,2,"Last night hubby and I decided to stop by and grab food to go. We ordered 2 Sicilian slices, fried calamari and broccoli rabe and sausage pasta. The Sicilian slices are usually really good but for some reason the sauce this time was overly sweeter then usual. I didn't like it . The fried calamari had oil on the bottom which made it soggy and the breading lack salt and pepper. The marinara sauce it came with was actually delicious and better then the sauce they put in the Sicilian slice. Now the dish that really made me mad and write this review was the broccoli rabe and sausage with ziti pasta. It was a oil night mare. It was so nasty and oily. There was no flavor it was very bland. The whole dish is covered in oil. The mushroom were large and unedible and lacked of flavor. Not to mention this dish is over 18 dollars. Such a rip off . We paid for oil and garlic mess .Save your money and go else where. It is not the same as before. The Spumoni  I didn't order last night but this might be the only thing saving this bussiness.

I'm not a big pizza fan but I had a piece and it wasn't bad, especially if you want to carb up to help leverage your alcohol intake. with the thickness of the dough, one slice was enough for me.when we went there (in the middle of the night), there was quite a line there. so you know this is a popular local spot.",7/8/2013,1867,987,1386,5bgsQymr8HDT3tyC1N3Uhg

1470,John D.,0,4,"It's no DiFara but it's pretty damn good!The sauce is what sets L&B above the rest.  They know that's their key ingredient which is why they put it on top of the cheese instead of under it. Why hide that deliciousness?!  It's sweet, which I love, and pulpy, which I also love.  The sliced (not shredded) fresh mozzarella cheese is nice but their crust is a sub par home for the rest of the ingredients.  It's not dense enough and it's too thick.  Crispy crust is a good thing if the dough is dense enough where it won't crumble into pieces when you bite it.  My advice for this problem: go for the middle slices instead of the ends.  It may be a little sloppier to eat but I enjoyed that much more than the crusty corners.Go to the window and eat outside for short wait times.  Get the Spumoni for your walk back to the subway.  Surly service here but that's to be expected from a place like this and part of the experience IMO.  I almost wonder if old school joints have that attitude as a front sometimes.  L&B is a great neighborhood spot and it's no wonder it's considered one of the best in the city.",5/22/2015,127,218,34,uaJn4TQcGDBqV6zHVQ43UQ
1471,Nick A.,0,4,"Definitely one of the better Sicilians slices I've had and it's definitely served by some world class jerks.A nitpick would be that it could use a little bit more cheese, but other than that it's the perfect storm of delicious sauce, soft donut-esque dough, and a crispy bottom crust.  It's not greasy at all and is very easy to eat, one of the lightest slices of pizza especially for a Sicilian style.  The regular slice looks god awful, if you come here and order that you might as well make the Brooklyn Bridge your next stop and do a head first off of there.There's about 20 Fat Joe/Bartolo Colon ex con looking slobs working here, only about 1 actually working, and none of them are pleasant and act like they are doing you the favor to end all favors by serving you a slice, it's sad that this great pizza comes from such scum.  It seems like a formula they stick to so my guess is that anyone with a weeks training can learn the recipe.I wouldn't be mad at anyone who said this is the best Sicilian they've had, it's a must try for a square slice fan and at least for that one try it's worth the garbage service",7/3/2013,106,337,189,2oUamc-HqV64jIiTdvpOhQ

In all seriousness, the flavor was not anything to write home about, so I'll focus on the rest. Small slices for a big dude, you'll want 2 or 3 (@ $2.50).Location: Deep in BK.

1486,Nike C.,0,5,"This is the place in Brooklyn to go have pizza. I went this week with my girlfriend, as I'm moving to Florida and had to have a couple of L & B's slices before I went. It was a Tuesday at lunch time and there was a line, but not the humongous line they have on the weekends. I got two regular slices (cheese pizza) and so did my friend. They have tables with umbrellas for outside eating. We carried our slices to the outdoor area with picnic tables and a roof-type awning overhead. It was much cooler there, as the day was sweltering. The pizza is great. I particularly like the way the crust has a teeny bit of charring from the oven. That's real Italian pizza. There was no shortage of cheese on the slice, and I love that. Still it wasn't overwhelmed by cheese. After you get your slice you can go to a service area to get napkins, oregano, Parmesan cheese, plastic utensils, straws for drinks, and the like.I had slices here years ago (early 1980s) and they were great then. They're also great now. I've eaten in the restaurant (years ago) and it was really good, but this review is about the pizza as that's what I go to L & B's for now.

Perfect crust, perfect cheese, and just the right amount of sauce. Complete perfection. The prices for the slices (which is what I usually get) is also very reasonable, with two slices setting you back $5.50. Also, others have mentioned this as well, but if you are looking to just order a few slices, make sure you go to the window all the way on the left past the ice cream window!

Spumoni is an acquired taste - not too sweet and with a chalky consistency - but my sister seemed to like it. I went with the lemon ice, and, well, it was exactly what I wanted.

1517,Catherine S.,0,1,"I am writing this knowing it won't do any good - this place is too established to worry about a party of nine people. However, the attitude of the waitstaff in the dining area was horrendous. I had called two times to see about making a reservation to celebrate my daughter's graduation. Each time I was told to call an hour before we wanted to arrive, so that's what I did. When we called I was told they were busy, so there could be a short delay, but it would be fine. We get there and the man we spoke to said they were busy, so there would be a 15 minute wait - perfectly fine. We waited 25 minutes and could see no one who we were waiting with (there were several parties in the same predicament, who also called ahead, and were told it would be no problem) had been seated. I went into the dining room and asked how much longer, since I was considering taking my party somewhere else. The man's response? ""What do you want me to do? Not seat people! WE'RE BUSY!"" So we left, and frankly I have no desire to eat in the restaurant again. Will we still get pizza here? Sure!

This made me a believer though, although this may have ruined me for any future slices of Sicilian I may consider eating. The cheese against the dough, under the sauce, is perfection. The dough is soft and pillowy, and the combination of that against the cheese was heavenly. We also tried the spumoni, which was tasty.We left and made it a few blocks away and realized we forgot out souvenir photo from Coney Island, so we went back and it was still there, set aside for us.

My parents like to eat in the dining room. We order way too much food since they like to take the rest home for leftovers. If you haven't been you're really missing out.

1521,ilan f.,0,5,"This place is a Brooklyn landmark. The square slice, known elsewhere as ""the Sicilian"" is their best known dish, but this place is no one trick pony. The Spumoni is also out of this world. Just because the Spumoni and squares are their specialty, don't overlook the sit down restaurant. It could easily survive as a standalone restaurant and give some of the better Italian American restaurants in Brooklyn a run for their money. Don't be fooled, anything with the Spumoni Gardens name means quality. The long waits and big smiles of patrons on their way out can testify to this.",8/14/2014,88,61,36,B1Y9_rZyPa_i3vCW8jiEkw

I always go for the center pieces as the side and corners tend to have a little too much crust for me. Pro tip: when they bring out a new pie, watch the guy cutting it. They usually just use regular knives to cut the pizzas and sometimes the pieces come out uneven...ask for the bigger ones of course. I've only had the pizza here, but plan to try the ice cream and italian ice sometime soon. I hear they're bomb as well.",6/28/2014,44,210,40,DqiOSchoZ3vaiRGmq_vXyQ

Thick and bready, with a nice sauce with tons of herbal/spiced flavor! If only you could get toppings on individual slices!I get their pasta dishes and heroes too, and the portions are great, but sadly the sauce is just meh for me. It's not bad, but it's not outstanding either. Still, like I said, the portions are what keeps me ordering those dishes/meals, when I need some fulfulling food for a long day/night of work.

1527,Tom Y.,0,5,"This place is famous for their Sicilian slices and spumoni, and it's easy to see why they've been loved for 75 years after taking one bite of their perfectly prepared slices!Each square is perfectly portioned, with a texture that's perfectly crispy near the bottom but super chewy, almost undercooked in the middle. It's almost like a savory nougat or caramel bar, and while that sounds strange at first, one bite and you'll see what I mean! The cheese and the sauce that rests on top is super delicious and while it can get sort of messy, it's okay because you'll want to be covered in this pizza if it was physically possible!There's not much more to say about the pizza, since it's pretty simple but executed flawlessly.I'll have to confess, I've never had spumoni before coming here. I never even knew what spumoni was! It is a layered ice cream (in this case with Chocolate, Vanilla, and Pistachio), and the texture of this one was sort of like a creamy Italian ice with the flavors of gelato. I really liked it, and definitely will be back for more!The service is super friendly, and the crowds here are fun to watch. I cracked up a few times watching some clowns honking while trying to get around the double parked people picking up pizza.Overall, I'm glad I made this stop on my summer pizza crawl, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a great little bite of Sicily right in Brooklyn!

Their ice cream selection is their only saving grace.Edit: Just tried their baked ziti recently thinking the restaurant section of this place would be better. What a bad decision that was. Sure, the portion size is generous, but that won't negate the fact that it's the worst baked ziti I've ever had.

1533,Ron L.,0,5,"L&B has some of the best pizza around, both round and square but their restaurant and take-out is equally awesome.  Be aware as with most Italian restaurants, portions are earth shatteringly too much for one person.  Get a bunch of dishes and have at it family-style.  Portions have been tamed down in recent years after their restaurant expansion, but good quality food doesn't change.  Wait times for tables are better than what they used to be, but definitely be sure to bring your appetite.If you're here for the pizza, order a square pie on the left-hand side of the building and share outdoors.  It's really good and while you're here, cool yourself off with a nice helping of Spumoni.  That's what you're here for right?  What's a spumoni?  I'm glad you asked.  It's an Italian ice cream concoction of cherry, pistachio, chocolate, and vanilla, which gives it the red, green, and chocolate colors that works.  Dont ask how, IT JUST DOES.Due to it's location, in the 'Hurst... accessibility can be a problem for those without a car.  For those that can make it, you're rewarded with good food and good company.",6/20/2012,1108,411,2193,ShSe4B4BaLr-jBbxHc76Xw

The things you do in a family of 6 to avoid arguments amongst the kids. Oh well, I turned out OK I guess, but I'm not eating Sicilian pizza by choice! I'm back to present times - checkAble to compromise with friends to get a regular pepperoni pie instead- checkTransports pizza home while being taunted by the great aroma- checkSits down to eat pizza - checkVerdict- this is probably well worth the trip for the Sicilian pizza which no longer seems to be a standard in the average Brooklyn pizza shop (used to be). My friends did taste it and were impressed. The regular pie was pretty good, but possibly too far from home to justify the trip for me.

1539,Bill S.,1,4,"When I was a kid I loved funnel cake. Loved it. I grew up and now when I order côte de boeuf , I'm never thinking about funnel cake. I feel the same way about L&B Spumoni Gardens. As an adult, I like thin pizza that was made in a coal oven. The LAST thing I want to eat is a slice of Sicilian pizza. All thick and bread-y. One slice puts me into a carb coma.Back then, my grandfather drove a dairy truck. His route was all over Brooklyn. I'd jump on that truck during the summer and we always had a great lunch. At least to me, pizza, deli or burgers. One of our lunch stops was L&B Spumoni Gardens. I'd get a slice and of course a Spumoni. We'd sit outside and eat. I thought I was the richest kid in Brooklyn. My pesky little brother was home and I was on the truck having both pizza and spumoni. Ha!When I got married and started my family, I always had a soft spot for L&B. I wanted my kids to share my childhood experience. Looking at it now with adult eyes, its an old, ratty place. So, I walk in and order.$19 will get you a small, Sicilian pizza.  This pizza doesn't have cheese covering the pizza but sweet sauce. Not too much oregano, just sweet sauce topping. (Now? I'd add toasted bread crumbs)So I have my pizza to bring back to the burbs. Am I finished? Nah, I need to have a cup of Spumoni.Like my grandfather would have bought for me as a kid.I have Ralph's Italian Ice in Long Island, I like Ralphs. Guess what? They can not compare their Spumoni to L&B.Does Ralphs have more pistachios in their Spumoni? Probably.There is a taste, its almost intoxicating, of good Spumoni that not too many can duplicate.That's why I give this place 5 stars. The sensory rush of the Spumoni and the fresh Sicilian pizza corner slice.

1561,Carrie W.,0,4,"I knew that we were going to sample real New York City pizza during our visit here, and have always believed that the best slices could be found not in overpriced Manhattan, but Brooklyn.  It was a choice between DiFara's Pizza (which has been featured on America's Test Kitchen), or L&B, featured on Man vs. Food.  Both looked great, but we decided on L&B because they also offered Italian ice after the meal, which admittedly swayed us.  I won't lie - we were kind of shocked by the surroundings.  Can we say sketch, boys and girls?  Seriously, a backdrop of high-rise projects wasn't what I'd had in mind - I felt like we were getting ready to dine at the (now-demolished) Murphy Homes in Baltimore, a prospect I wasn't looking forward to.  Parking was nearly impossible - there were cars lined up outside in the middle of the road and we were about to give up when we saw an empty spot across the street.  We grabbed it, and counted ourselves lucky.  There is zero organization to the ordering line(s) here.  People were just milling about all over the line and we didn't know where to go so that we didn't jump in front of anyone.  I hate ordering systems like this because you run the risk of being rude and cutting in front of people - a star off for that.  I was having so much anxiety that my boyfriend gently suggested for me to find a table, he'd order.  (Yes, it was gently - no ""shaddap, lemme do dis"".  Heh.)  We ordered half a tray of the Sicilian with pepperoni and mushrooms - yes, I KNOW, it's sacrilege to order the Sicilian with toppings, but TFB (too fuggin bad), it's how we roll.  At 19 dollars for half a tray (12 slices), the price difference is significant.  Besides, we didn't know if this was going to be good or not, so we went with the larger size - after all, if it sucked, we could just dump it somewhere, maybe in Central Park.Anyhow, it didn't take too long for the half tray to be done, maybe 15 minutes or so.  LoML brought it back with a couple of Cokes, and away we went.  Real New York City pizza.  This better be good.We opened the box to huge, greasy, saucy goodness.  My word, it was just beautiful.  I picked up an end piece and dug in - whoa.  This is some EXCELLENT pizza.  The bread was tender on the inside, crispy on the bottom, with just the right amount of melty cheese in the middle.  The sauce was just the right level of sweet and salty, perfectly balanced.  The mushrooms were perfect, the pepperoni just biting enough on the palate.  If this represents Brooklyn, I think I want to move here.  My boyfriend was enjoying it, too.I could only eat 2 slices - my boyfriend, 4.  I know, we're wimps.  But we wanted to save some room for that lovely ice cream.  I finished it off with a peach Italian ice that made me want to sing ""Ave Maria"".  Seriously.  This Italian ice was like no other I've ever had.  It was sweet, airy, light, and drippy.  It was wonderful.  My boyfriend got a shake - I don't even know what kind it was, it tasted like chocolate and hazelnut, but it was definitely delicious.So what did happen to the other 6 slices?  They didn't end up in Central Park after all, but in our bellies after a quick buzz in the microwave - in Baltimore.  Yes, they were even that good after we got home.  We sat in our bedroom, slowly munching the last of it, saying to each other that we'd best enjoy it while it lasts.  L&B Spumoni Gardens will definitely be on our list when we return to Brooklyn.  And we will.  After all, I have to start searching for that house.  :D",9/5/2012,148,517,290,aB867JHc0gxKujKuLeIxNQ

1563,Meghan A.,1,5,"I first saw Spumoni Gardens on Man vs. Food and I instantly wanted to make a pilgrimage to Gravesend. My opportunity came on an early Sunday evening last Spring. We made the trek out there on the D-train, and it took about an hour from Manhattan. Boy was it worth the special trip.There was a little bit of a wait, maybe 15 minutes or so, but we were soon seated. Spumoni Gardens has a small takeout area in the front, outdoor benches, and then an actual restaurant. It is the type of Italian restaurant I used to frequent when I was growing up in New Jersey. Old school, red sauce, big portions. They serve assorted pastas, typical dishes like chicken parm, and of course the famous pizza. We went there specifically for the Sicilian style pizza that was featured on Man vs. Food, so the two of us ordered a salad and 12-slice square pie to split.The pizza came out and it was truly fantastic. The bottom of the pie was crisp, and the inner crust was thick and doughy. The mozzarella was placed directly onto the dough, and was sliced, not shredded. It was topped with huge ladles of delicious sweet marinara sauce, and then some grated parmesan. We ended up having a few slices leftover to bring home with us. Overall, it was amazing and very special pizza. I just wish I had a magical transporter that could spare me the long subway ride.",3/18/2012,236,596,540,xmSfcGW8W4N-m3YvxinHag

I had told the waiter about 3 times that I did not receive my food, which was quite annoying for lack of a better word.

I took some slices to go and a woman on my train got up to sit next to me to see the name of the pizza joint on the box, it smelled so good.The pizza: Maybe I'm just not a fan of thick crust pizza. This one was definitely unique, as the crust was chewy and, perhaps, undercooked. I like my pizza thin crust and crunchy. Regardless, the sauce was incredible. Barely any cheese, and the cheese that was on there pooled into small dots. Tasty regardless, on account of that sauce.The spumoni was incredible despite its bright unnatural colors. If you get it to go, it comes in a freezer paper bag that keeps the ice cream very cool despite the 90º+ temps.Not sure it's worth the trek, but if you're in the neighborhood, definitely go.

1581,Marisa L.,1,5,"This has been my favorite Sicilian style pizza since my childhood and I love it the same every time I return. Their pizza has been featured on Man v. Food and is really just excellent. Their square is thick, crunchy on the bottom, mushy on top and they put the sauce over the mozzarella and then sprinkle with parmesan. The sauce is hearty and sweet, just the way I like it. It is great (and packed) in the summer because they have a huge outdoor seating area. It is pretty hard to park around here (you will notice the double parked cars, motorcycles and usually at least one cop car-because the cops around here know where it's at-and it's not the Dunkin Donuts down the block). It is still decently priced and retains its neighborhood feel, even though people from all over Brooklyn come here. And the slice? Please don't come here if you are ordering a round/Neapolitan slice. There are plenty of places to go for that. If you want a hefty, filling saucy square then you need look no further. The hardest part is always saving room for spumoni and ices. L&B is also known for it's spumoni so make sure to try. The traditional spumoni is 'rainbow' but not the red, white and blue kind. This is creamy gelato, pistachio and chocolate. I can't wait to go back and although I don't live as close as I did as a kid, I make sure I take my annual summer excursion here.",6/3/2012,100,615,693,mJbSn-Av4gnux0QkvE5uVg

We sat outside on the patio and there was just droves of people coming in and not enough people to accommodate everyone. I also tried some of my friends meatball hero and there was just really no flavor.

She disagreed, but she also hates cheese aka she hates pizza so idk how much pizza lovers should value her opinion on pizza...We did eat at the restaurant and got the seafood salad to start.

1602,Anthony D.,0,4,"Came here during a little pizza tour of Brooklyn I did with my girlfriend on a random Sunday nightWe each got a square slice and some arancini parmigiana. The pizza was definitely on point. Nice big Sicilian slices that were hot and fresh for a very reasonable $2.50 a slice. Dough was crispy on the bottom and airy in the middle, but it had a lot of body and was able to hold the zesty sauce and nicely layered cheese, just the way a real Sicilian slice is supposed to be.I'd give this place a perfect rating, but our arancini parmigiana took over 30 minutes to be ready even though the guy told us 10. By the time we got it it was cold and just not very appetizing at that point. Other than the slight arancini mix up (which we were ultimately comped, which salvaged the review from 3 to 4 stars), L&B Spumoni is a classic staple of Brooklyn pizzeria history that everyone needs to try if they haven't.

1604,Liana L.,1,3,"2 stars for the quality of the bread and the pasta. 4 stars for the pizza and and shrimp caprese. I'm being generous about the pizza because my brother reeeally hyped it up for me :/ All in all, I do not believe that L&B's was entirely worth waiting an hour for. I'll have to come back in the summer for spumoni as well, but I'm frankly disappointed. I don't understand why they bother serving bread when it's practically stale. The cinnamony bread was okay, but I felt very dissatisfied with the bread overall. :/ My dad got the veal milanese with spaghetti & marinara on the side (automatic option). The veal was sadly bland and dry, and the sauce did not compensate well. The spaghetti in marinara was a joke; it looked and tasted like there was no effort put into it at all. The shrimp caprese, on the other hand, was bursting with flavor; I think the egg was also marinated in the sauce, and it was a hit. The pasta did not pick up the sauce well, and the al dente state of the pasta was heavy, rather than bouncy. It wasn't very enjoyable. The famous, oft-raved Sicilian pizza was well-presented and doughy. My brother insisted on getting the plain one (because it was purportedly ""so good already""), but I was unable to appreciate it in its original splendor. I can love plain pizza if the sauce and cheese is amazing, but this pizza ... I don't know. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the heavy doughiness. Service is difficult because it's so busy. :/ Unless you know you love Sicilian pizza, spare yourself the wait. I would definitely go elsewhere for other Italian food.",11/4/2012,500,719,2424,Nmo7FytsQZBRBhKe3CpP3A

But they seem to have lost their way slightly.I used to dream of that saucey hidden cheese pizza when I would pull up and fight to find a parking spot. I am not sure what changed; perhaps different ingredients or the kitchen was a little off that day but it just wasn't the same.It was STILL delicious and amazing but when you've had L&B as many times as I have, and the fact I am giving 4 stars imagine what it would be like if they cooked the pizza the way I remember?Regardless though, the crust is great, their cheese is very authentic and seems of good quality, and don't forget the sauce. I just wish their trays of pizza were more evened out in terms of sauce. One slice had almost no sauce while another slice was absolutely drenched.But regardless, this is a Brooklyn gem and perhaps it was an off day. I will come back soon and hopefully update this to 5 stars :)",9/7/2014,68,79,55,C21ThqA-cuEVeDBKyDlNZw

Visiting L & B is a Brooklyn pizza dining rite of passage. You go, you enjoy a square slice, some spumoni and the atmosphere and you cross it off your culinary bucket list.I have never had a bad experience dining inside. The dining room can get crowded and loud - be forewarned. The food is prepared well. I love the cold seafood salad. I've also had two seasonal salads with shaved ricotta salata - one with fresh sliced pears, the other with fresh sliced strawberries. Both were excellent. Every time I've visited I've left stuffed and satisfied. Never had a reason to complain about anything at L & B.",2/21/2014,233,185,40,ICsYzTwCnnZ54Wn4xhhlpQ

I guess I like my cheese on top of my sauce....  Ya know?  And when you travel this far out of Manhattan for pizza - the only other time I ever even HEARD OF Gravesend was when I had an intern from there! (but that's a story for another time) - it had better be good! I won't go in to all the bizarre screw ups by the restaurant with regard to service, seating, and availability of oregano... but I couldn't wait to get out of that crowded cramped space. It had that old-time doing-things-the-same-way-forever/where-have-YOU-been? vibe.  Like a club that you don't belong to cause you're not from around here...  At any rate the pizza was priced decently and it wasn't bad but I would never make that trip again. Then again, I know that pizza is one of those things everybody has their individual taste for. I am sure there are people that adore this pizza, for whatever reason, if nothing else because they've been eating it their whole lives. They've managed to stay in business for so long.

1625,Chris G.,0,1,"I understand the neighborhood fondness for the unusual square slice, I used to enjoy them as a kid, however, there's no good excuse for the glowing reviews on their pointless, unimaginative, tired, anything-but-authentic 'Italian' restaurant fare. It's not even a good imitation of decent Italian American food. When you're a 'red sauce' joint that continues to do business and your red sauce really sucks ( tasteless & bodiless), one might think you were living on a memory.After eating pretty easily the worst 'Italian food' I've probably had in years, I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and as I considered getting one of those squares to chase the bad meal away, a guy delivering Chinese food came across the courtyard & asked me who ordered the food. I told him to bring it inside and I thought, at least the staff knows not to eat here. Hopefully you do too.PS, it's been years since I've had spumoni and even that hasn't aged well.

Inside: ONLY ORDER THE CHEF'S TABLE, I am not kidding, the rest of the food is awful, possibly on purpose to get you to order the Chef's Table; but the Chef's Table is really quite fantastic. Outside: The point is not the pizza -- the pizza is fine; but point is that you are sitting outside mixed into the most motley combination of human life it is possible to see all at once, and Maria The Ice Cream Girl's truck is going by, and everybody's freak flag is flying high, and you're all eating spumoni and slices together in the sunshine and the world, as personified by the borough of Brooklyn, feels heartbreakingly crazy and unexpected and sad and funny and real, and THAT, my friends, is the point of having pizza at LB Spumoni Gardens.",1/20/2014,4,63,0,vCfgVDMR3T1yIs0MqIPu6w

Inside ordering, outside ordering, waiter service, pizzas being made by the dozens, ice cream lines, pizza lines... L&B has got this thing running like a fine watch. And the place is fine indeed. I will be brief on the pizza as 1000 or more people have already reviewed it... I would just call it simple Sicilian pizza perfection, executed flawlessly. I only had one slice as we were on leg #2 of the 'great Brooklyn pizza contest'... but I wanted to eat some of the other food I watched being served to other tables as well- veal parm sandwiches, spaghetti and MB, salads.. etc. Shit, I wanted some of it all.Man, if I lived in BK, I'd be eating at L&B a few times a week.... so much food... so little time.",7/25/2014,199,251,2,Ju3OcHAx8PY1FainHIF7XA

Still family owned today, the pizza is out of this world...Oh and to be clear, when I say pizza I mean the Sicilian slices... Don't waste your time on round slices... Their method of cheese then sauce on top is perfection... I myself crushed 6 slices yesterday with ease and then washed it down with a cup of classic spumoni (it's not ice cream, it's just spumoni) to finish the perfect lunch.  If you are anywhere remotely close to Brooklyn, do yourself a favor and pick up a slice or a sheet (they're not pies, they're sheets).  Having to say I'll be back is borderline insulting...

1644,Anne Marie M.,0,5,"The great knowledge source Wikipedia informs me that, ""the term 'pizza' first appeared 'in a Latin text from the southern Italian town of Gaeta in 997 AD, which claims that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze ['twelve pizzas'] every Christmas Day.""  With this knowledge, it seems appropriate that  L and B Spumoni Gardens had a wait for outdoor seating on a 30 degree evening two nights before Christmas. Before dinner I needed to wash my hands. As I waited in line for the bathroom, I watched magic happen. The assembly line looked like it was a Kodak moment straight out of Naples. Large hunks of Mozzarella turned into perfect white sheets as they fell from the deli slicer. Dough was being tossed and kneaded and pinched perfectly on to trays. The pizzeria itself is nothing to write home about and the dining space, as huge as it is, can not keep up with the demand. The pizza, however, is nothing short of perfection. The hearty, sweet thick dough, a thin layer of sweet and tangy sauce perfectly proportioned amounts of motz that cover the entire piece, more sauce and dusting of delicious Parmesan. Mmmm I'm still dreaming about it. Make sure to order an extra slice.

Tried broccoli rabbe which was delicious. Also had the Sicilian eggplant which was different from how they make it in Sicily but still tasty. Imagine baked ziti with eggplant and mozzarella on top. Also tried pepperoni pizza which was interesting. We got the half pie which was thick crust with 2 pepperonis on each slice. Very little cheese, .mostly sauce and bread. It is lighter bread but still thick crust so u gotta be up for that. Also tried salad, and plain slices too. Dessert tried the spumoni which was a nice portion and ice cream sundae. All tasty. Definitely attracts the array of clientele. Thnk mixture of jersey shore with all the classic stereotypes.Worth a visit if you are into Sicilian slices.",9/8/2012,41,754,530,EblK20dUUogxra1VI23BGQ

Yet in all my 31 years, I had never been to the Spumoni Gardens before. The girl and i ordered a half pie, which is 12 square-shaped slices for $19.00. Since she is the veteran of this place, she placed the order while I took a table outside. My rear end end had barely hit the seat when she came back holding a white square shaped cardboard box. It was out in maybe three minutes at the most. I guess they prepare them in advance because the demand is so high! This was just amazing pizza. The crust was thick and crunchy, the ruby red sauce tasted homemade. The mozzarella is layered under the sauce and there was just enough cheese to bring the whole slice together; it wasn't overpowering at all. For my own taste, I added a little extra oregano and parmesan cheese. Nothing else is needed, no sausage, no pepperoni, no veggies. It tastes perfect just the way it is. Thumbs down for Pepsi instead of Coke, but hey, what can you do...I topped it off with a small watermelon ice, which I split with the girl.

We actually decided to eat in the restaurant area and waited longggg. Too long. We sat an ordered pasta dishes,  I believe I had the rigatoni in a bolognese sauce. Not impressed. Lesson learned.

1660,Mike B.,0,5,"As good as everybody says it is.  Very seldom do these types of places live up to the hype.  This one does.  In the summertime, this place is almost magical, with families enjoying pizzas and memories at the tables outside.  In winter, you won't wait as long.Look at the reviews: the people who complain about it are the kind of people who'd complain about a slightly crowded subway car.  Yeah, the place is crowded.  Yeah, there is a lotta young staff who need some guidance.  Yeah, you'll wait and maybe bumped around a little especially during the summer.  Still, everyone's generally friendly and there are enough efficient people running the place that it still manages to run smoothly in the end, even if it doesn't really look that way.I will agree that the spumoni (while I really like it,) is unusual and kind of an acquired taste.  Also, the pizza crust is salty: again, to me, in a good way (sometimes salt IS the appropriate seasoning.)And here's a tip: it's much better value to buy a 12-slice Sicilian pie and take the extra home than buy it by the slice ($20 for the whole pie, while $30 for the same amount if you buy it by the slice.)  It travels well.",12/25/2013,15,404,21,F_N4NyoMJWzBYFspeYfH3A

Highlights are the roasted artichoke hearts, cold seafood salad, dueling jumbo shrimp, the grilled steak, and the dessert platter.  Table wine, beers, & after dinner liqueurs are also included in the price, so drink up.  DISCLAIMER: If you sit down for the Chef's Table, realize that it is no exaggeration a 3 hour affair.  You better make sure you enjoy the company of those you are dining with, otherwise it will be a lonnnnnng night.  Service can be hit or miss, but for the most part it's good.  Bottom line: Whether you're in the mood for a 5 course Italian meal that will leave you breathless, or simply for a great square slice, this is the spot.  Fuh'getabout'it.",1/25/2014,395,180,3,LAFjeKP-oGTnHek9AxQjng

I walk up on this brisk day, get a square and a round, for the sake of variety.The service was all over the place. A woman came and asked for half a tray, but specifically asked that it be from a fresh pie. My square and round go in the oven, and my friend orders the same: square, round. Hers does not go into the oven. I'm not sure why, because I'm pretty sure she didn't order cold pizza. She had to ask for the pizza to be heated. I don't really get that at all. Four slices from the same two pies, yet one order goes to the oven and the other doesn't?Anyway, my two slices arrive, and a moment later, hers arrive from the oven as well. We sit down and...yep, tastes like disappointment.The round is just bad. No better than any nameless pizza shop on the corner. Seriously, choose a direction, walk until you find a pizza shop, and that place probably has a better slice than L&B's round. Moving on to the square, L&B goes for the upside down, sauce on top construction. I love pizza like this. The crust was just okay. The sauce was tasty, and the cheese was not very well melted. Should I have been like this woman and requested only a slice from a fresh pie? If the pizza becomes so inedible after cooling that reheating can't save it, then I question its quality.The only saving grace was getting an italian ice to wash the sadness from my mouth. Nope. Nope nope nope nope.",11/3/2013,370,245,30,vEzS1635Jc8aDq8Ugk1FlQ
1664,Mckenzie G.,1,4,"My cousin brought me here as one of her favorite places and I left a fan as well.  This is the perfect place for a summer afternoon. The outdoor seating area is huge, with tones of picnic tables both under and outside the overhang.  If you want a quick service go with the half pie.  Ready to go all you need to is grab a few drinks, paper plates, and napkins and go to town.  Definitely go for the center pieces.  I started with an outside piece, and was a little unsatisfied at first, but as soon as I moved onto my 2nd (and last) piece (an inside one), I could totally see what my cousin was talking about.  Great doughy crust with a nice layer of sauce and cheese - all you really need for a good slice of pizza.  The leftovers were just as good as the first go around - a key component in a good pizza place.  This is not the place to go for gourmet pizza, service, or decor, but for a summer chill afternoon, it's pretty perfect. They also carry Spumoni, which makes this the full italian experience",8/16/2012,158,522,5,VqSFTE5f-mDzoLeXS-16xw
1665,Doreen L.,1,4,"In 1939, Ludovico, Sr. and friends from the old country built the pizzeria. In 2011, Italian, Chinese and Russian neighbors come to feast on Barbati's Sicilian pies and spumoni. On a hot summer day, yes- you are sweating balls, yes- the lines are long, but it is worth a short jaunt for their Sicilian slices. Artichoke pizza- you were my first Sicliian and I shall always love you but L & B- you make me love Sicilian all over again. Biting through the layers of sweet red sauce into a one inch thick fluffy dough is extremely gratifying- even on a hot summer's day. Notes:-they deliver but its better to order and pick up. I've ordered from them to only get the food an hour later and receive boxes of cold pasta.-out of their many pasta dishes, my favorite is the fresh clam sauce (white or red).The clams are plump and the sauce is not too oily.- The Barbati clan reduced the pasta portions from 15 inch diameter box to 10 inch- so feed yourself accordingly.",11/28/2011,1229,1043,7313,Dq_Jkpx4xpbh4iofayOr6g
1666,Jessica C.,0,5,"L&B's is my go-to place every time I'm in Brooklyn. The square slice is the way to go! The pizza is usually piping hot since they're constantly making more trays of pizza one after another. The dough is thick but soft and there's just the right amount of sauce on top. Once you're done, walk a few feet over next door and get some spumoni or frozen treats. They have a wide variety of ice cream and soft serve you can choose from. While seating is very limited in the actual pizza shop, they have ample outdoor seating which is perfect for days with nice weather.You're stomach will leave happy and full!",4/19/2014,189,107,65,472BxYmmVXuUvTVpDpaDRw

They may have competition with Totonnos for the best regular slice, but you are not coming here for a regular slice; you are coming here for squares. No place can ever compare, and if you ever want the true Brooklyn feel, you have to come here in the summertime. This is how we did it when we were kids, and this is how they are still doing it.

Spumoni's square is in a class of its own, offering a fluffy and satisfying alternative to the cheesy triangle in a laid back location. In addition to a fantastic and unique square you'll get top notch Italian ices and their namesake frozen treat, which isn't quite like any other ice cream you may have had. Their attached restaurant serves classic red sauce Italian fare that can stand up to any other old-style place in Brooklyn, and at reasonable prices to boot.

The sausage is sweet (a perfect amount of salt) and juicy! The peppers are so flavorful. I would typically remove it when there is too much because it does nothing for the taste but the peppers and onions here are so good! The bread is good too. I tried their other food as well. There isn't anything special about the pasta, meatballs, or calamari. The service can be a bit sloppy (I stayed in for two occasions and on each occasion, they missed something). Would not recommend the meatballs at all. The pasta is just ok. It tastes like something I can make at home.I tried my first spumoni here and it was really interesting. I liked it. I definitely want to try it again without the chocolate flavor.4 stars for the delicious sausage hero. Definitely get it.",12/31/2013,570,141,105,-WwEg9vj27vywpxfSI-jZw

The hype is well-deserved, for sicilian - you're not going to get much better this this!We also ordered the Arancini (Italian rice balls with a meat/peas filling) which took more than 30 minutes to make. I think they forgot about our order because when we got it, it was lukewarm. Thankfully, the server felt bad and we ended up getting the food on the house.

This pizza is bottom up good. The tomato sauce is devilish and tasty, the bottom of the pizza is nice and toasty but the good stuff is somewhere between the thickness of this pizza and the temperature. Each time I've been here they have served it right out of the oven. Consistency is a restaurants' biggest battle, but they have battled it out day in and day out.

It's family owned for over 70 years. It feels like family when you're there.2. You know summer is approaching when you start seeing the outdoor red benches filled with people.3. It's busy but you never have to wait long because they are super efficient and organized. There's a window for pizza slices, a window for pies, a window for ice cream, an indoor area for other pizzeria goodness, and an indoor full italian restaurant.3. The indoor restaurant has a full excellent menu with goodness like their chicken parms and pasta (you can order pizza too). Some nights you can catch the owner walking around and if you're lucky, he picks you to be the special guest of the night...and you will soon find yourself rolling out of the restaurant with a happy satisfied round belly.4. Spumoni Ices and soft serve ice cream. Enough said.5. Last but not least, their PIZZA....namely their famous SICILIAN (square) SLICE. It's just perfection--the tomato sauce, cheese, and thick bread that has a nice crust on the bottom but soft on the inside. Simple and satisfying on every level. If you're craving just the NY thin slice pizza (my favorite kind of pizza), then just get a regular slice - you will not be disappointed. I promise.I don't get as many chances to go to L&B as I used to as a kid, but every time I do pay a visit, it takes me back to my good old Brooklyn days.",8/27/2015,139,142,726,hGx2ZIExlyTpDYlsmJ51Sg

Then your teeth just sink into the perfectly sweet and ruby red [2] tomato sauce, one of the most amazing pizza sauces I think I've ever had. Next is the sliced (not shredded), [3] mozzarella cheese. That's right, melted mozzarella underneath the sauce vs. the traditional on-top structuring, serving as a pretty genius transition from tomatoes to super-soft, huge pillow of delicious [4] dough. It's science, people. I mean, just look at that thing. Wow!And if I had the creative capacity (or the perfect Webdings font), I would totally draw their famous, and equally addictive, spumoni for you. But really, you don't just slice this triumvirate of vanilla, chocolate and pistachio ice cream in half with your plastic spoon and examine its inner workings. You're just too damn busy shoveling one of the most perfect summer treats out of that little paper cup and into your spumoni-hole.I've totally gone out of my way to get my L&B fix. And if you're looking at a map of the city, chances are this joint is out of your way as well. Let me just tell you, this place is over 70 years old, and serves standard-setting spumoni and some of the best pizza in New York, which is no small task. I say screw the map - it's worth the trip.Listen, I wasn't born in Brooklyn, but going to places like L&B Spumoni Gardens makes me feel like I just might've been, in some, strange, alternate-universe sort of way. I see the Little League team sitting on those outdoor benches with their dads and coaches, the underage girl and guy on a date sharing spumoni, the old woman who probably grew up with my grandmother taking down a square that's as big as her head, all of this during a balmy, summer sundown, and I get this nostalgic rush from some youth that never happened, yet totally could've.

1712,Brendan T.,1,4,"This place is the embodiment of old, non-hipster brooklyn.  Im also pretty sure its the only pizzeria in Bk with a parking lot.  Located smack on the border of gravesend and Bensonhurst, two neighborhoods with, let's just say very colorful legacies, which I say with the upmost respect of course.  The place not surprisingly has a storied past itself, not all of it pretty.      It's all about the square here;  a one of a kind,relatively thick pie somewhat reminiscent of what I knew as Sicilian pizza growing up east of here, with it's bready, cavernous, slightly crumbly crust.  The top of the pizza is in a class of its own,  with minuscule, if any mozzarella used,  instead it's loaded with a sweet tangy tomato sauce and a liberal amount of Romano or Parmesan, I'm not sure which.  Consistency varies from very good to exceptional.     It should be immediately evident that there is no need to ever try the round pie here, ever.  I have never moved past pizza into the menu but I've heard that they serve solid renditions of all the pizzeria ""kitchen"" standards.  Some people really like the spumoni, which is a variation on italian ices.  I'm not opposed to finishing up a meal with one, especially on a summer night, when this place is at its peak, and you feel as if you are in an awesome mash-up of Grease, Saturday Night Fever, with just a dash of Goodfellas.",4/11/2012,424,351,2221,wMIEYgLlkxB_iyshP6OB_g

Good pizza, very saucy, loved that the bottom crust was perfectly crisp.Can't go to Spumoni Gardens and not have spumoni, but I didn't love it, gave it to my friend after trying a bite. (She loves it and was about to order one anyway.) Instead, I really wanted a soft-serve vanilla cone. I'm only used to Edy's version of spumoni. Might just be a matter of taste, maybe even poor taste on my part? Maybe I just don't know what good spumoni is supposed to be.Definitely will be back, and next time, I'll follow up my pizza with their new creamsicle soft-serve ice cream!Both pizza and ice cream were enjoyable, even though we were sitting there shivering outside in the cold.

It took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order and about 15 for someone to take our food order. I honestly couldn't believe how bad the service was. Good thing I was able to eat the pretty stale Italian bread with butter while waiting. The food actually came out faster than I anticipated based on everything else. The calamari was decent and then came the sicilian slice that I was waiting for. I took a bite and immediately wondered why anyone would think it was good, nevermind great. The sauce was bitter, cheese had a very strong taste. The actual dough of the pizza was nice and soft but sauce and cheese ruined it. We wanted ice cream and had to wait about 15 minutes to flag the waiter down and another 15 to get the ice cream. I got a spumoni ice which wasn't bad. Overall, would never recommend this place to anyone and in my opinion the pizza was terrible.",4/16/2014,16,86,41,DMQ-2s5vBRbp9wUHpmVAhg

Apparently, this place is known for their sicilian pies. I came here yesterday after a fun run in Coney Island and ordered two regular (no topping) sicilian pies. The crust was pretty crispy but was disappointed that it didn't have much cheese in general. It looked like they just poured tomato sauce on top and let it be. The slices are pretty thick too so after eating 2 slices, I was already full. Pies are ordered as whole pies only, which means you can't do half toppings.  They have a decent amount of outdoor seating so perfect for a nice day out. Overall, it was an ok place for me.

1748,Kathleen D.,0,4,"Literally everywhere else in the city we would called them, ""Sicilians,"" but at L&B they've always been known as, ""squares."" I gave up wondering why or asking questions about it a long time ago; that's just the way it's always been since I've been going there, since I was a kid. And my father before me! So they're squares. And that's just what I want when I come back to L&B Spumoni gardens: a crunchy corner and a middle slice too.Believe me, I have and always been all for a thin crust regular slice over a Sicilian any day of the week pal, but the thing here is the square. It's my favorite square anywhere.It's a good saucy slice with a dense crust, all crispy bottomed. There's cheese under the bright tomato sauce and on top of that, a liberal dusting on top with powdery pecorino. I think about these slices often, and always in the context of the end of a dog day's dusky twilight under the umbrella-ed picnic benches out on the front patio. What's better than that? Not nothin.OK. So if in tellin the truth, the last time that we were over at L&B  a few weeks ago it was absolutely the most triflingly steamy, humid, thick-as-pea-soup foggy kinda night It gave me clown hair and resulting general crankiness, but, a bite of that slice can really transport a chick back.Actually, if I were truly time-macined back to a twelve year old me, clown hair could have well been in effect too. Lion-fro Lord of the Thunder Cats was my unfortunate nickname at the time, after all.Anyway, the point is: Ah yeah, another taste of childhood pizza nostalgia, this is. Squared. Going to L&B's is a true Summer ritual and the fact that said tradition guarantees a cup of creamy, pistachio-packed spumoni at the end of the meal makes the deal even sweeter.",8/1/2013,366,384,39,I0ezkVvCcBnavJf2soWHjA

After placing a delivery order for almost $80, the food was sent an hour and a half later and it was complete garbage. The fried calamari was a tin full of completely soggy, chewy pieces that were completely inedible. The sausage and pepper hero was disgusting too. It tasted like it was slapped together on pieces of white bread that were soggy as well. When I called to complain, the manager said,""we warn everyone before placing the order that the calamari will arrive soggy"". Sure they do. Who the hell would order a large order after being told it was going to taste like garbage? Certainly not me. So I guess L&B's will be a huge thing for Brooklyn transplants and yuppies. But for anyone with good taste, stay away from L&B's unless you feel like throwing your money in the garbage.

1756,Mitch E.,1,5,"Oh snap! Which establishment is going to get my 300th review? L&B Spumoni Gardens of course. ""Why?"", You ask? WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT QUESTIONING MY DECISIONS?Well if you must know it's because these special centennial reviews I've been doing have common themes. Great Brooklyn establishments with a rich history, that I've experienced with my family growing up. It's the summer time now and what better place to go than L&B? I can think of at least 50 places I'd rather be, but that's not the point. This is a place you'd be very happy to be at on a nice summer's day. There is plenty of parking a block or two away but what fun is that? Don't you want to double park in front like everyone else and their mother is does. No joke, I came with my friend and his mother showed up double parking her car. Uncool Ms. Liverwursen, I'll let it slide. She does make mean PB&Js, so I can't hate. Or maybe you'd like to check the full parking lot, where some guy is taking up two spots. Some woman didn't even bother attempting to park and just left it in the middle of the lot essentially blocking three cars from leaving. When you try to U turn out of the lot some guy will be coming in and that guy coming in will yell at you for being in the way of his destination, which is no where because there is NO PARKING! But the real treat is what I would experience here on late night weekends as a teenager. Woah, souped up cars doing doughnuts in the middle of 86th street  getting chased by cops. Is that Vin Diesel and Paul Walker? No wait. It's just some stereotypical goon talking with his hands and being too aggressive as the police start to arrest him, while his friend sitting shotgun is crying.  Oh Brooklynites, you make me proud.  Once you decide it was better to park elsewhere you start to experience the real magic, people watching! Parenting 101 is in session and you see some winners up in here. That's right Gina you shouldn't hit your ::EXPLETIVE:: brother. You tell her, random mom. Oh random dad if you won't pay attention to your crying and screaming baby, who will? THE WHOLE PLACE WILL, that's who! Put some spumoni in that kid's mouth already! Getting a whole pie for the family dad? Oh, your giving one slice to each of your kids while you eat the rest for yourself. Who's dad does that? Oh wait it was mine. (On a sweet sentimental note. This is  where I bought my dad lunch for the first time once I got a job out of college)All types of people coming here. People from far away lands come here, like New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester. Old Asian people come here just to sit down, they're here for people watching too apparently.  Russian men having a conversation which sounds like they're about to fight each other but are actually complimenting each others family. Adolescence with so much hope and promise, illustrating how they are influenced by their great heroes...... hip hop artists and basketball stars. Elderly people who only get ONE SLICE, because they'll die before they have a second.Now lets talk about the pizza. If you order a regular slice, you're gonna get a look of death. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I don't care if you don't like Sicilian slices. You get that Sicilian slice! That's why this places does the business it does. You can get that regular slice anywhere but no one makes a Sicilian like L&B. I'm not saying it's the best, but it's unique and can not be replicated (Sorry bootleg Barclay's center knockoff.) Why is this Sicilian bad boy (No, not Tony D from Bensonhurst) so delicious? The dough is so good, super soft. The cheese is right on top of the dough and then they put the sauce on. Oh I'm in heaven just thinking about those slices. I get a minimum of four every time. You can't just leave yet, you must get the spumoni. You MUST, or I will find you. I'd say go with pistachio. Vanilla is pretty good too. Don't get chocolate and I love chocolate.  Place could get super packed at times. If you need to use the rest room there's one around in the back. You might find a nice young man asking you if you want to purchase some things he has for sale. You just let him know you're high off eating some of the best damn pizza this world has......... and if you want I guess you can see what he's offering. L&B Spumoni Gardens........

The restaurant is very good too but I mostly go to the pizzeria section and sit down in their outdoor seating area.",7/30/2014,22,21,14,T5BW9b7n3nhL1nOQDCMs4Q
1760,Alla P.,0,4,"More like 3.5 stars. I wenty here a few weeks ago with my family. It was decent.. perhaps it was slightly above decent, but only slightly. The pasta sauce felt like it could have had a less sharp taste to it. My uncle ordered a slice with pepperoni and it looked like a plain slice, reheated, with pepperoni thrown on top of it. The calamari was pretty tasteless. The food itself is pretty good, but can be improved. The ice cream is slightly better, bumping it up to almost 4 stars in my book.Definitely a place worth trying out for their Sicilian and ice cream, but not worth going to if you're expecting an amazing Italian dinner.",6/27/2014,149,35,0,DYQIgabiGuHpT_orO3fyFA

They have a rainbow option where you can get pistachio, vanilla, and chocolate in a cup!

I went inside and asked for a high chair and the generous waiter offered his assistance with carrying it outside to my table.I ordered a square (for me) & round (for my daughter.) When craving for a Sicilian, this place is hands down the best. I had what was leftover of my daughter's slice and it was mediocre. I can easily find a slice that taste better elsewhere. For dessert, I shared a watermelon icy with my daughter. I'm not a huge icy fan so I wasn't that impressed.

I was not the least impressed. The dough is thick with the center dough tasting and having the consistency of being half cooked. There was a thin 4-5mm layer of tomato sauce and thats pretty much your square sicilian for $2.50. I noticed families ordering a whole box of the sicilian. Did I get a bad batch or do people really enjoy eating half cooked pizza? We had a group of 6 and there was a unanimous decision that Spumoni's pizza was probably one of the least palatable we've ever tried.In hopes to redeem themselves I had to try their spumoni ice. I asked for a sample of two flavors but I was served a small serving ($2.50) with the requested flavors. I brushed it off since he may have misunderstood me. The flavors were watermelon and kiwi.

Sorry but it definitely doesn't even come close. There was too much dough, the sauce was sweet which I don't mind too much but it was just okay. I did enjoy their special dessert. The dessert is different at every table and depends on the the amount of people that you have. Loved the fudge, cheesecake, not so much the brownie (and I usually LOVE LOVE brownies but not from here), the gelato was good too but not for me. The table next to us had two cones with a few gelato flavors on a plate so depends on who makes the dessert and what they feel like putting on it.",11/15/2011,4,29,35,NcU6eG_CI4XEh0AxU_WiSw

1773,Alis H.,0,5,"Un. Real. Best sicilian slice ive ever had (Pinocchio's in harvard sq is now second best). Nothing beats the crispy bottom, soft doughy 'middle crust' (yes, very technical term), tasty cheese that defends from sogginess, and the uber fresh, homemade tasting tomato sauce on top. I can never decide if a side piece with extra crust or a middle piece drenched in sauces is best.. so i just eat multiples of both! Obviously only been here for the pizza. Have been here just for take out slices to eat in, and with a group of 36. Take out- always hot and fresh Sicilian slices to take out immediately. 2.50/slice. CASH ONLY. Don't think they have an atm on premises. You can ask for middle and side pieces. Spumoni- delicious! has nuts so beware. With group-set menu: Salad was really fresh and tasty. Had Sicilian and  regular cheese pizza. Obviously Sicilian is waaaaaay better. i hate cheese pizza (where's the meat??) but better than most places and regular pizza crust is good. I love it when the cheese strings and the regular definitely did that. They have gluten free pasta options for those of you that can't partake in the pizza to cry into. Definitely worth the trek. and once you're done eating in, grab a box to go! Baking sheet, 450 oven for 5 minutes to reheat and it's just as good as fresh. *Barclays version is not nearly as good as getting it from the original. We still get it every time though.

Cold mixed seafood salad had only one shrimp and 3 mussels. And was mainly calamari salad. Everything was far different and frankly mediocre from previous visits. The last about a year and a half ago. Also Waiter forgot our order for a piece of their famous square pizza. So we left without introducing it to our friend.

I use to go here as a kid and it was way different in terms of ordering. But it was nice to go in and have a pie already waiting for you. Wait time? a few minutes to ring up. The pie was a bit expensive for me. But, I mean this is legendary pizza here. Many compare to Di Faras. In my opinion, they both are from  different ball parks. Iv'e had them side to side and I equally enjoy each of them. Probably by far, the best square slice I have ever had. The sauce to cheese ratio is just right. For me at least. It's a very friendly atmosphere, they have tables set outside. Perfect for a nice summer day. Oh man, I cannot wait to go back and devour a pie.",8/17/2015,1,21,21,CQDlsQNieSFCKoFsvUmD7A

We ordered what they're ""famous"" for- the Sicilian pizza. It was dense, burnt, and the mozzarella was obviously a cheap brand (which is probably why they hide it under 2lbs of pizza sauce...but, as long as there's hype, and people that don't know good pizza, this place will always be in business- despite the poor service!

We sat outside (under the tent!) on a blazing hot summer day with my sister, who was back in town for a few days, and wanted to revisit her favorite places. Her check-in was met with texts and replies of jealousy and requests to bring/save a slice. The reputation is of course that well known.Rice balls, regular and square slices were lined up and we proceeded to feast. The rice balls are made with meat and veggies inside and smothered in sauce upon request. Depending on the specific size of the ones you get , it could be anywhere from 3-5, so don't worry they are not giving one person more than another. Slices are still great, I preferred the regular slice, very cheesy and the sauce was good and sweet, she liked the Sicilian with the sauce on top of the cheese and the light/crispy crust (not dense or doughy). She made room for Spumoni and enjoyed every bit.

After getting sat, we waited about 15 minutes to get our order taken and silverware placed on the table. Clearly there is a lack of communication or the waiters are assigned too many tables. I got a Sicilian slice as an appetizer and it was delicious. For my entree, I ordered the rigatoni vodka and i was not impressed. For dessert we ordered the spumoni and the waiter brought out a beautiful presentation of tartufo and spumoni to make up for the bad service. This dessert was absolutely delicious. For anybody coming here, i recommend just getting the pizza and dessert. The other food is not worth getting, especially how expensive the upcharges are ($7 for chicken! and $8 for a side of 2 meatballs!)",1/10/2016,83,6,7,vbo9Bb9ailJ-jsjhpFbmcg

1785,Jennifer C.,0,1,"L&B used to be the best but their pizza is now hit or miss. One thing that is consistent, however, is their terrible delivery service. Every single time I call they say delivery time is about 45 minutes, but that is never the case. Sometimes it's an hour, sometimes an hour and 20 minutes. The other night-Thursday, not even a very busy Friday or Saturday-I waited 2 hours. After several calls inquiring and hearing that the guy left already, the bell finally rang. What we received was an old, ice cold pizza. It was obvious that it was sitting there, reheated and sent, then sat in a car until it was inedible. A call to complain resulted in them sending another pie, this time just a little bit warmer but still not up to par on the freshness and quality that I expect from such a renowned place. The delivery guy also demanded the cold pie back, probably to reheat and send to the next unsuspecting customer. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from here again, and when I'm at the place, I will wait for my slice to come fresh out of the oven.

1791,John H.,0,4,"I can't imagine coming here at any time of year except for the summer. The outdoor seating and ordering just seem to be an integral part of the whole L&B experience. As such, L&B is a great family spot and there are loads of kids stuffing their faces with Sicilian slices and scoops of spumoni to evidence that. But, even without kids, this is a solid spot to visit with a group.As a matter of fact, it will behoove you to visit with a group or, alternatively, a really hungry fat guy. The ordering line for single slices is separated from the line for half and whole sheets of Sicilian so you'll save a lot of waiting time by ordering a half/whole sheet. We had a group of six people coming in from a day at the beach and we just managed to down a half sheet, so that should give some context for how much pizza we're talking about here.It's hard to add much to what's already been covered at length here. L&B is a Brooklyn institution and for good reason. I'm not a big fan of Sicilian pizza but L&B surprised me. The sauce had a nice tomato tang with an appropriate amount of sweetness and the volume of cheese was perfect.The spumoni wasn't my thing but that's just my opinion and given the fact that almost no one leaves this joint without at least a small cup of spumoni, I'd say I'm in the minority. Either way, it's part of the experience so give it a whirl if it's your first visit.",1/4/2014,39,109,24,c-xjwmWEsFyCHpZN1Am2mg

1793,Navneet S.,0,4,"I'm not a native New Yorker. So I think that affects my preference for types of pizza. I personally prefer a nice thin crust with not too much sauce and cheese. I like pizza to not be too overwhelmingly heavy and with interesting topping combinations.Spumoni Gardens is not that kind of place. But even though the pizza here doesn't really match my particular preference, there's just no doubting that it's really great pizza. What you get is a typical grandma slice: thick, soft, cheesy, with just the right amount of crunch to make even me happy. The pizza tasted so fresh that even I couldn't really complain.Now let's talk about their spumoni ice cream. Let's just say you haven't really had spumoni until you've had it here. Again, not something I typically crave, but if and when I'm going to have spumoni I sure hope it's only from here. Not overwhelming, didn't taste artificial, and was just light enough that you wanted to keep eating more. Fantastic.I'm curious to come back and eat inside the restaurant. I wonder what else this place has up its sleeve...Overall, definitely recommend checking this place out.

1801,DieHipster S.,0,5,"Spring is here and summer is right around the corner which means the greatest squares on earth will be popping out of the ovens at L&B's; real Brooklynites will be out in front enjoying it just like they have for decades. God I love this pizza - probably more than I love clotheslining hipsters off of their Wicked Witch of the West rusty Schwinn bicycles as they pedal around their North Brooklyn parentally paid-for overpriced lofts in the middle of any given weekday. The sauce is sweet yet tangy; the cheese gets put on the dough before the sauce which kind of insulates it and keeps it slightly under cooked in the middle (which I love) but the bottom gets crispy.This place is not hip, kewl, ""up and coming"", trendy or anything else like that. It's simply GOOD AND NORMAL which is so hard to find ever since the hipsters invaded Brooklyn. Here you'll hear actual Brooklyn accents - not nasally Midwestern fauxhemian shrieks coming out of the mouths of emaciated wanna-be rock stars and disheveled-looking yet upper-middle class transplanted ""starving artists"" and ""creative assistants"". Here, you'll find 90 year olds and 9 month olds; parents bringing their kids for lunch after little league; cops, firemen, and EMS workers on break; and all sorts of people from around the hood - not 'NABE"" - who the hell says ""naaaaaabe""? Oh yeah the hipsters from Cul-De-Sackia, Wisconsin. So if you are a real New Yorker and somehow haven't tried this amazing pizza yet - please do. If you are an out of town pizza-head who doesn't act and look like the average try-hard wanna-be Brooklynite hipster beardo, then also please come on down. However, if your name is Caleb, Maxwell, Zane, Canola, Hummus, Hamilton, Molly, Quinn, Quaid, Reid, Hayden or Linus; if you are over 25 and skateboard to your gentrification-latte shop job; if you play the banjo or upright bass on the L Train; if you have a Smith Bros. cough drop beard and wear teenage girl's skinny jeans; if you wear a fedora hat and Henry Kissinger thick framed glasses; if you show up to embarrassingly childish Bushpointburg art galleries with your child molester moustache to pretend you like wine, cheese and art; if you're over age 7 and still play kickball.....THEN STAY THE F*CK AWAY YOU FILTHY BROOKLYN-RUINING HIPSTER PIECE OF SH*T.",5/5/2013,1,13,0,C5-u6VgVgAViXbX6SVPALg

L&B slices are different from other pizzerias because I don't know how they get their bread so freakin fluffy and soft, BUT STILL CRUNCHY. If I don't make sense, it's cause I can't really justify them in words. Some may consider the softness weird and uncooked, but it tastes perfectly fine to me.A pie costs around ~20 and really fills you up. 2 slices does it for me, but sometimes I cut a third slice in half cause I can't help myself. L&B has outdoor benches, which aren't the cleanest, but eh, you're already eating pizza. You'll probably drop sauce on yourself anyway. They have spumoni ices, which are super refreshing in the summer, and also entrees (like pastas and appetizers). My friend tells me their portions are huge and they are tasty.

I am giving it four stars because I feel that their drink selection was poor. Two different types of soda and water. Maybe it was just the day I went but I feel that they could have had a better selection. I will be going back here again for some more squares some time soon!,9/24/2013,44,31,0,fIJhQnVFFj2UoI-ROSiAbA

1836,Shannon Z.,1,4,"I came back to L&B after a good two years with Gabby S. This place is somewhat close to my house but for some reason I never really come here. It's a good thing I don't though or else I'd be the size of a whale from eating their delicious italian food. The two of us ordered calamari, linguine carbonara, a slice of their famous sicilian pie and two desserts (tiramisu and spumoni). The food was definitely on point. In my last review I stated that the carbonara was delicious and a must try. I ate it again today and this time still doesn't fail to disappoint me. The sauce was so creamy. The calamari appetizer I ordered was made just right. The squid was definitely cooked to perfection. Not too overcooked. It needed a bit more salt/pepper but it's nothing the salt and pepper shaker couldn't revive. The marinara dipping sauce that came with the dish was somewhat bland so I squeezed a little lemon juice in there and the taste came out a lot better. The sicilian slice is everything people rave about. I honestly really like my thick crust pizzas to be a bit ""moist"", that way it can soak up all the tomato sauce. L&B's made it just that. The tiramisu wasn't anything to rave about, I've definitely had better at other Italian establishments but man the Spumoni they had was off the hook! Next time I hit up L&B, I'm definitely bringing home a pint or two. Our waiter was really inattentive. Our bus boy was a lot better. My friend asked our waiter for some water and he didn't fill it up. When she waited and saw that he wasn't going to refill our water, we gave up and asked the bus boy to do it. It wasn't like the waiter was busy anyway since we went around 4 pm on a Sunday afternoon so no good to that. Our waiter literally came to us two times throughout our whole meal. 1, to take our order and 2, to ask us if we wanted more dessert. lame. The bus boy was really nice cause he replaced the spumoni I ate at the restaurant with fresh spumoni when I said I wanted to take it to go. I wasn't expecting such a nice gesture. He was kinda funny and enthusiastic too. Overall, a good family style restaurant with a no fuss Brooklyn attitude, just the way I like it.",8/25/2013Updated review,493,804,847,W305Vv8_ZqFf1LKB6dvGDA
1837,Annie Z.,0,4,"REALLY good pizza. Tried both the square slice and the cheese slice (triangle). The square slice barely has cheese on it but somehow tastes like its loaded with flavor. Its very doughy, like expected but has a great texture its sort if like a layer of sauce, a layer of chewy, then a layer of soft and bouncy. not sure if that makes sense but it tastes great! the cheese slice has a good amount of cheese on it and was pretty regular but the dough was flat and tasted better than a normal slice. The spumoni (ice cream ish) is DELICIOUS very creamy but also super light not sure why. overall great place lost a star cause it wasn't the best thing I ever ate but very good and worth the trip.

1845,corey m.,0,1,"Somehow I see these guys popping up on a bunch of top 10 pizzas in New York lists, so on a recent bike ride out to Jacob Riis I figured I would stop by to see what the fuss is all about. There was a smallish line at 6pm on a Sunday, hopefully a good sign that the pizza is worth waiting for. Some locals got into a bit of an argument with the counter guy about something or other, and when I got up there to order, he was throwing me a bit of attitude as well. Whatever, maybe the pizza's fantastic. God knows those assholes at Patsy's on 118th could use a manners lesson, but the pizza up there is so perfect, I never really care. Anyways, back to Spumoni Gardens. I have no problem with Sicilian style pie. I often order Grandma slices for a change of pace, I like the crispy fried bottom and substantial thickness. I've had better square slices pretty much everywhere I've ordered them in the city. The Spumoni Gardens sicilian slice somehow has zero air bubbles in the crust, and no stretch or tooth to the dough. Which means that since it's about an inch thick, you end up with a huge, uniformly dense crust, with that cheap white bread texture. You know how on a nice loaf of rustic italian bread, when you slice it or bite into it, the remaining bread springs back into shape? And you know how when you pick up or bite a slice of wonder bread, it compresses anywhere you applied pressure and doesn't spring back? That's what this stuff is like - it has no tooth. Combine that with the fact that it's necessarily doughy, because of the thickness, and the complete lack of any kind of fried texture on the bottom of the dough, and you have basically a wonder bread crust with crispy outsides. There are about 2mm of cheese and tomato sauce on top of that - personally I like to have my cheese bubbling a little bit so the fact that it's underneath the tomato sauce kind of prevents that from happening, but whatever. If the crust was edible it'd be forgivable. The comparison to grade-school lunch pizza is accurate, that's what it most closely resembles. I don't know, if you grew up eating cheap processed bread products maybe this will be sentimental for you. Otherwise go somewhere they invest a little money in some decent flour.Oh - the spumoni was pretty good!",7/21/2013,9,50,7,wU3IsWm95pjjq34TodjZSw

The pizza on first bite provoked a reaction as follows: ""eh, I don't know, that was a damn long ride on the N."" But within a minute it grew on me in a major way. This is probably sacrilege to say but it reminded me of a few of my favorite Chicago joints. It's Lou Malnati's with 1/2 of the crust thickness (cue outraged NY'ers who would rather walk over hot coals than desecrate their palates eating deep dish). Crispy but not dry, good balance of sweet vs. tart on the sauce, and cheesy but not Pizza Hut-style overkill.

1854,Deserie S.,0,2,I'm giving two stars cause I like there spumoni ice cream but other then that I don't like they're  food at all. They're over crowded and you can barely get in the parking lot nevermind finding a spot. All in all not a fan.,3/26/2016,80,24,2,LBqp_Flx3KFoi45FeAE5NA
1855,Joe S.,0,5,"How can you not love this place? It's the perfect end to a long lazy summer afternoon at Coney Island (especially if you've lazed at the beach past 7:30, the inexplicably early closing time over at Totonno's). Hop on the train one stop, walk over, get in the long, super-quick walkup line and sit on the kind of picnic tables that dotted the public parks wherever you're from. It's an experience unlike any other - no frills, no pretense. Just a metric ton of pizza at a great price. Of course when you're there, get the square. And load it up with red pepper flakes, more cheese, whatever you want - the crust can take it and it enhances the experience - tempering what is otherwise the pleasant mild sweetness of the pizza. If you're a pizza fanatic like me, you'll surely have already watched the various media showing how they make it here - cheese (sliced) first, sauce later - and it makes a difference. Hell, the sauce is so legendary a mafia war (literally) almost broke out over it in 2012 - there was even a federal trial - look it up. It's nothing like the rest of the city's thin, crisp, greats - it's a thing of its own and it's a beauty.Oh yeah, the spumoni? Try that too! Pretty sweet, but really nutty and really great.",9/13/2015,6,157,6,vV3Yh-z6SxL8wxizVh87og
1856,Janel Y.,0,4,"Made the hour and 45 minute (one way) train trip after hearing about this place on some TV show.Here's what we ordered:-caesar salad ($7.95): I thought this caesar salad was pretty darn good! Probably because there was so much cheese in the dressing! I ate the whole thing!-Sicilian slices ($2.25/ea): light and airy dough and the bottom crust perfectly toasted! I only ate one slice but could see myself eating another one because the dough is so light and doesn't fill you up fast!I am a new fan, but for where I live, not worth the trip to go on a regular basis. Service was standard and the place is quite large. There's outdoor seating for those who want take out and a place to eat. Then there's the dine-in option.",12/27/2011,299,1407,1628,Wb5Gs_FpWDYjrhn0luPd3A
1857,Gus F.,0,3,"OK, I'll admit, I'm a total pizza critic.  I like my pizza in the 98 percentile range.   To most people, they might very well love this pizza and maybe the quality has dipped as others here have indicated.  But I must say, I was disappointed.   Perhaps it was the anticipation of hearing about it for years and  I mistakenly built it up to something it couldn't achieve, but I can't say that this is exceptionally good pizza.  In fact, I found the soft Sicilian slices to to be rather void of any crunch that a typical pan pizza would/could/should have.   The sauce, cheese combo is good, but when put together, overall, I unfortunately wasn't impressed.   Maybe you'll feel otherwise.   Two star rating overall and one additional star for the mere fact that the place is an old school shrine which totally love.  If there is another visit I'll try a sandwich since the round pizza even looked below average.  I find it hard to believe that this is the best that Brooklyn's got to offer.",5/9/2013,0,22,26,9NEDp7lEltu_13OQpNwlag

I grew up across the street in the Marlboro Houses, now, as someone who has lived many places and traveled the world, I still find myself coming back to L&B for their squares and also (don't tell my cardiologist) their sausage and peppers hero. The spumoni as many people have noted remains delicious. I even notice now that tour buses stop in for the ""feel"" of the Brooklyn landmark. From the Ozark Mountains to China, the world now knows of this Brooklyn family joint that is decades old. Just don't try to park. You'll be waiting forever.",4/23/2016,0,3,0,OWcOIkCsuhLWHkOIfmgF7g
1860,Natalia M.,0,5,"OMG you can NOT live in NYC and NOT have been to L&B Spumoni Gardens. This place is a staple and worth the reputation it has. Its legendary.So this is how it works right? You take the train. I wanna say the Q, but I can't even remember at this moment in time so just look it up. Thats why google maps were invented folks. It is a bit of a walk to get there but its worth every step. It gets crowded during the summer so be patient. The great thing about this place is there are like three parts to the experience. There's the outdoor pizza ordering. You get a sicilian slice. You DONT GET ANY OTHER SLICE! ITS WHERE THE LEGEND COMES FROM. Sure, cheese on first, sauce on after. Its been done elsewhere. Yeah I get it but don't dismiss it. The sauce is amazing! Its almost sweet and the crust is so crispy. Everything is at such an amazing balance. The next stop is the window right next to that one where you get your spumoni. Ive gotten spumoni ice cream before. Does not do it justice. Have it here. If you don't like nuts, ok then don't get this but if you love it, get it. The flavors are perfect and such a refreshing end to your meal.The third stop is next to THAT window its just a step indoors where you can order heroes, sandwiches, you name it. The cool hero is any with broccoli rabe. Thats not it though.... it of course has an indoor restaurant and its AMAZEBALLS!! Look its Brooklyn. Of course there is amazing Italian food all over it. L & B gives everyone a run for their money. Normally when I see lasagne on a menu, I shrug and go ""Meh"" I'll pass. My friend's aunt ordered it. Get it. Just.. just get it! Its amazing. The food is to die for! Everything everyone ordered at the table was yummy goodness and nothing was left behind. No doggie bags and there was a lot of food AAAND if you still want a slice of sicilian while you wait for your meal, you can totally order it. Nom nom.The outdoor portion is loaded with picnic tables, people double park just so they can run to the windows, order, and run. Its awesome. I highly suggest you try this place out at least once in your lifetime.",4/21/2014,84,21,0,xSOyys_8hgza-7b6WVzF_g

Ahhh I love it. If you haven't been here yet, it is worth the voyage.  While parking is a pain, I do recommend driving so you can take a pie home as well. Yes, it is that good.Unfortunately their prices have gone up and the size of their slices has gone down through the years, but man that pizza is still one of the best there is!

1864,Jeff F.,1,4,"Never been to Gravesend? Yeah, me neither...until now. And it was def worth a visit out to this much-heralded pizza joint on a rather mundane strip in South Brooklyn. Why?The squares man, the squares! Not quite a grandma's, not quite a sicilian and def not you're average slice of pie. This is a whole new category, almost like an upside down slice with the ample sweet red sauce on top and cheese nestled comfortably underneath on top of crispy, thick crust.And due to the high volume they're always coming out pippin hot n fresh...no stale ass, laying around pies here.And in addition to the unique pies, the layout of this place is noteworthy due to a LARGE patio deck with picnic tables out front for your sun-worshiping pleasure. A great way to spend a leisurely lunch throwin down some tasty squares!And lest you think that's all there is to it, this is a 3 in 1 kinda place with a wait serviced indoor portion if you want something slightly more formal and of course, there's the spumoni next door serving up the name sake Italian ice cream.So gas up your metrocard and day trip it or make it a pit stop on your way to Coney Island.",4/12/2011,224,260,964,qctH-ANPIIcJM4w5u7JyVA
1865,Nino R.,0,3,"I really wasn't impressed with the round or square slice.  Maybe I was still in shock from Di Fara.  You see, on this day, I decided to visit three pizza icons in Brooklyn; Di Fara, L&B, and Totonno's...known to many as the ""Three Kings.""L&B was stop #2 on my trip.  Mind you, I had just waited 30 minutes at Di Fara for a slice, a slice that was topped with very fine extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.  I still had that flavor on my pallet.  The round or the square at L&B could not compare.  For what it is, it's decent and priced right.  I didn't have the opportunity to try the spumoni or ices, but I'll definitely get around to it--so a review is a possible.  This review is based solely on their to plain slices.  And for me, they were kinda plain.A bit of a letdown...",8/5/2013,306,2147,1484,4u8zZaT5m7nO1WazdKA2sw
1866,Jan G.,0,4,"L & B is well known by those from South Brooklyn.  They specialize in Sicilian pizza but with the cheese under the sauce.My family and I are big fans of the pizza.  Because of the volume of business L & B does, the pizza is almost always piping hot and crisp, not soggy.The pizza is a bit more saucy than it is cheesy.  There is limited indoor seating in the winter but ample outdoor seating in the warmer months.  There is also a restaurant attached to the pizzeria.  Great food and good portion sizes.  The staff is very accommodating and I never have a problem ordering a dish that is no longer on the menu.  I couldn't give five stars because their waiter service is usually painfully slow - even when the restaurant is not crowded.",3/17/2017,0,13,0,a5WUGn8eOWOvRuptT7xwIA

The slice is made with cheeses under the sauce, and generous Parmesan on top. I would eat here every single day if I could. I've been going to L&B since I was a kid; the restaurant also hits it out of the park. Delicious Cesar Salads, Calamari, and fried mozzarella.

1869,Katie L.,1,3,"Based on L&B takeout -- My office ordered 10 boxes of L&B's famous Sicilian pizzas on 2 separate occasions, and both times I was incredibly underwhelmed. I get the whole ""mozzarella melting into the dough before topping with the sauce"" dynamic, but didn't think it produced anything particularly tasty. Both times the pies arrived partially cold (we're in WFC across from 9/11 site, so I may give them some leeway there), but both times I also tasted a hint of something rancid. Maybe it was the sauce, or the hardened cheese that hadn't melded entirely into the dough and just laid like a dried clump of wax, but it was off-putting.  The dough was good, not crisp because again it was traveling, but the sauce was a bit too heavy, and weighed down the slice. I think they'd be better straight out of the oven, but still not extraordinary.I will say my Italian coworkers could not stop raving about L&B, cold Sicilians and all, more for sentimental value than anything else. The other ethnic make-up of our office were not blown away. Another +1 star because both times they were free lunches so I'll be fine.",3/6/2011,270,264,706,g9fb9xwV9299kImBKR5DQQ

If you're going to eat it you need to go on an empty stomach because I was full after 2 slices. You have to put this place on your list!! The interior of the restaurant is really tight and it has a classic renaissance vibe to it. If you just want pizza, they have a to go area outside for just that.

The crust/bread was soft and chewy, the tomato sauce was sweet and well seasoned, and the cheese added a nice touch of richness.

People love this place in the same way Ray Lewis loves Jesus. It's just a little too loud, a little too forced, and a little too shreiky and obnoxious.Not sure if they are nostalgic for some point in history 50 years ago when this place served edible food, but that is no excuse. This place is dreadful. Imagine a stale piece of bread with disgusting tomato sauce on it, hiding sub-par cheese underneath and NASTY service, and you now know what this place is about.I will say nothing else, because this is the last time I ever wish to mention this place, or spend more than 5 seconds even giving it my attention.",2/5/2013,44,94,0,TtcIjjxb-LkIyOdoaFMgGw

Not trying to be mean or derogatory it's just that you have no basis for comparison, you just don't know anything about pizza. But we're not expecting to you to know, just stick with your new york friends, do some breathing exercises or yoga to clear your mind before you have a slice, be patient,  its going to take some time for you to figure it out.

1886,Lacey R.,0,5,"L&B Spumoni Gardens is an institution in Brooklyn. It's over 70 years old, and has been owned by the original family since their humble beginnings with a pushcart and horse!  (And Spumoni Gardens was featured on Man vs Food! I heart Adam Richman.) Located in Bensonhurst, people FLOCK from all over to grab a slice of their famous Sicilian pizza. (Don't dare order a regular slice! Sicilian is the way to go.)  There is usually a wait for tables and pizza, and since we were late to meet everyone, I was freaking out that the line would be insane.  Lucky for us, the place wasn't too crowded, and my BFF Allison did us a solid by grabbing some tables AND ordering a pie ahead of time, so it would be ready when we arrived. I will state that I was never a fan of Sicilian pizza. I was (and still am) a thin crust loyalist.  But this pizza... it was good.  Most Sicilian slices, at least that I've had, are very dense, and thick, and almost too much dough.  But this was a perfect ratio of crust, dough, cheese and sauce. Not too saucy, just enough cheese, the spices were spot on.  How good was it??  I had 3 slices.  THREE.  If you know me, I barely finish anything.  Except bags of microwave popcorn.  Even though it was dripping gross cold rain outside, and we were stuffed to the gills with pizza, we ducked into the restaurant side of Spumoni Gardens next door for.... spumoni!!!  If you aren't aware of what spumoni is, Wikipedia defines it as ""Italian ice cream made with layers of different colors and flavors, usually containing candied fruits and nuts. The ice cream layers are often mixed with whipped cream. Chocolate and pistachio are the typical flavors of the ice cream layers."" Yes please!!!  I got pistachio, while my husband got chocolate. I've never had spumoni before, and it was kind of a blend between ices and ice cream, but very sweet!! Not going to lie, the pistachio was only OK. Wah wahhh. The chocolate was really good though. And I wish they would have had the cherry flavor, but no luck. Maybe next time!!",3/16/2011,242,117,226,8hFlkCwRNKEdqHB_oVJsMQ

This place is extremely crowded most of the time except when it's raining and is hard to get a seat indoors and for this I do have to take away one star for poor planning as with most places in New York. Every time I come visit I have to get a square slice. The sauce is excellent and I love the cheese underneath. What happened to the weather in June and where are all the bees? I missed the damn bees,6/19/2015,90,41,47,ho72wFBeuPudjg_iC8I7eQ
1898,Lindsay S.,0,4,"very different pizza, perfect for people who are big fans of sicilian slices. extremely heavy and the sauce and cheese is backwards! The tangy marinara is different than your usual pizza place sauce but thats what makes it interesting. Ices were fine but I wasn't super crazy about them.",6/7/2013,60,170,0,6x1C2ANl2XWDMjNO1nkrVA

1901,Rachel T.,0,4,"Great alternative to the traditional NY slice joint, but is definitely a trek for anyone without a car (only times I went were automobile-facilitated). The pizza is heavy on the bread and sauce (um, yum!) with a light dusting of cheese. Slices are always fresh out of the oven, and two of these bad boys are plenty for dinner (and will leave you enough room for spumoni for dessert). Get a mix of all three flavors (pistachio, vanilla and chocolate).",1/5/2014,1,52,0,YWD21Aq2XIIZMt_mhT4wmg

I always get either half a pie or a full pie becos 1-2 is never enough. Their spumoni is also great! Love the pistachio flavor and if im feelin greedy i'll get the rainbow (all the flavors) pint to go! This place gets very crowded in the summer becos they have outdoor seating. They have a small parking lot but most of the time ppl jus double park get what they want and leave. They also have a restaurant located to the right, i've never had becos theres always a wait for a table but heard its good becos they serve italian dishes. I'll try eventually!",2/21/2015,344,485,283,8ATa2qznkwgx3ACAT5y0Hw
1904,Jess L.,0,3,I find their pistachio spumoni addicting but their pizza isn't really anything special to me.  It taste just like any other normal pizza and I don't see what the hype is about.  i tried a box of their square pizza and some of it were pretty burnt.  Def come back here mainly to get a tub of spumoni but not so much for their pizza.,10/12/2016,6,80,28,sLwKnbQwFJdSv6a8kbSckA
1905,Rico A.,0,1,"Went to the restaurant with a party of 12 on Saturday and what an utter disappointment. They put us in the little glass greenhouse which was cold and drafty. We asked for the heat to be raised and they said it was as high as it goes.The waiter comes and puts out cups of ice and brings no water until we had to finally ask. Then he fails to bring bread and butter like everyone else gets when they come here. Finally after 20 minutes of sitting they bring the bread and butter. We ordered appetizers and the fried calamari was good but the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes on a bed of sandy arugula was awful. Then after he ignored us some more we finally had to call him over and take our food order. My grilled chicken on arugula and fresh mozzarella was very plain and again the arugula sandy. My nephews fettuccine alfredo was literally submerged in half of bowl of oil and had to be brought back. We brought two birthday cakes and when we asked them to bring them out they brought only the cakes and a knife, no plates. Another 10 minutes waiting for plates until we thankfully left. Lesson learned: it's not the same as years ago. Also, if you're gonna come here,  just get the pizza and spumoni. For any restaurant fare, go somewhere else.",2/14/2017,0,8,5,YHDg6BCkqbum92v3uhc8fg

1910,John B.,0,5,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion....so here's mine: L&B has the best Sicilian pizza....period. Whenever I'm passing through and have time to stop off the Belt, I grab a box and some spumoni and bring it to my friends in Virginia. Try their rice balls too - they are amazing! If you go, it helps to bring someone with you so they can wait in the car. It's usually hard to find parking, so people double park. Go on a Friday during Lent and be ready to triple park! Lots of seating outside. Even on crowded nights, if you wait a few minutes, there's always someone getting up and leaving. This place must make a fortune - good for them....with the quality of their food, they deserve it. If you're in Manhattan visiting NYC from out of town, skip the cab ride - take the N (yellow line) to the second to last stop and walk a few blocks. The area is pretty safe but like every place, you might not want to roam around too late at night because there are a few rough spots here and there in the area.

1920,Marina K.,0,2,Do not understand the craze. I've lived here forever and the only thing worse than drowning in a crowd of obnoxious guidos here are the square slices with burned edges that taste like the actual stove.

1926,Ronald Z.,0,4,"The first time I came here, my vegan friends ordered a pizza without the cheese. We initially got weird stares but that was the best pizza I've ever had - AND IT WAS WITHOUT CHEESE. We expected our bill to be $20+ for dining in, but nope, it was only $16 for that pie. It was great. The second time I ate, I went with my mom. We sat outdoors and had a great time, except I thought the seafood salad was calamari salad, so I ordered the wrong item (my fault). The third time though, quite a disappointment, so I knocked off a star. It was a takeout order this time, so I ordered a seafood salad, Seafood pasta, fried calamari, and another dish for my mother's birthday. When I got home to open the dishes, I saw inside wasn't a seafood salad, but yet calamari salad (in addition to the fried calamari, which wouldn't make sense - there's so much calamari). Prior to confirming my order, i the cashier asked me if it was seafood salad and I confirmed that it was.

1937,Jared C.,0,3,"L & B specializes, and in New York is supremely famous for, Sicilian style pizza, and the ""garden"" which is a bounty of outdoor seating in the form of picnic tables. Place an order at the window to the left, which can be slightly off-putting if you delay your wishes even a second or two. Square slices of the Sicilian ($2.25) are what to start with, the crust is as puffy and gooey at the same time as you could ever wish.But hmmm... how to explain? This is good pizza, it is. But's it's not really pilgrimage worthy pizza like many make it out to be. If it was across the street from me, I'd choose it. But the grumpy moods and craziness of all the people in the garden on a nice day are just not a comfortable combination.Gravesend is fun though, and you can combine a trip out here with some other good eating that you normally would not do.

Is it amazing? Hardly.  However, the reason I give this three stars is because the environment is really familial, familiar, and friendly.  The food doesn't live up to its hype but, if I just happen to be driving by, I'd go here again.",5/5/2015,121,25,2,y-MMxGrikBd7wt9ZQpMo8w
1943,Alan K.,0,5,"Getting into a debate about pizza with someone can be just as dangerous as opening up a discussion about religion or politics...it is something that can lead to a huge argument. But when we decide we want pizza...there is usually no debate about where we're headed. And we'll defy anyone to show us if there is any better pizza than the square pizzas at L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn , N.Y.This place is simply iconic. It has been around for generations and continues to be as popular as it ever was. During the warmer weather, the lines for pizza and their famous spumoni can be winding around the large area of picnic-style tables which are always packed. And during the colder months, there are always people vying for a table inside the pizzeria which is separate from the more formal restaurant.We can never get enough of the pizza...which explains why we recently went for dinner and drove back over the two bridges the very next day to get more for lunch. And, of course, you can't leave without finishing it all off with the best spumoni you will ever find.This place is frequented by the locals...and it is also revisited often by those who have moved away. During our last visit someone said that they traveled a great distance to bring their family for dinner because, ""You just can't find this kind of pizza and dessert any place else.

The tomato sauce is amazing (I love sauce!). The square slice didn't have a lot of cheese but was really good. I wish we would have read the reviews beforehand and ordered a square pie instead.

1947,Kenny L.,0,5,"Oh. my. goodness. Oh. my. dayum.""It's the elite spot for pizza with service! You have to go!"" said my sister. Normally, I'm not a pizza fan, but with family from the west coast, sure why not. Right off the train station walking and all of a sudden, the aroma of tomato sauce and fresh bread hit me. ""What an alluring scent, surely can't exist in Brooklyn..."" But it does.Goodness, large outdoor seating with numerous customers taking pies to go while others sit and eat their beauty of a slice. So many happy faces from various ages - the elderly laughing and holding a slice that's 3/4 of their face, middle aged couples eating and talking aloud, teens on their mobiles snapping their slices in the proper lighting, and young'ins chewing while eyeing their next slice. What a friendly and joyful place to eat at - fantastic atmosphere.Within the restaurant, the seating space isn't the largest, but it can hold an abundance of fun and deliciousness. Slightly cramped and ninja-ing your way through seats - the customers I nearly bumped into were all so friendly; guess I chose the right path.Anyhoo, onward to the order. Honestly, come here for a pizza. 12 slices is 1/2 a pie I believe, so image 24 slices of soft chewy bread layer with flavorful red tomato sauce with your desire of toppings. How can you say no?! My group also ordered pastas, chicken entrees, and I got a lasagna plate as sides if you will.Our 1/2 square pie was: 1/2 with mushrooms, 1/2 plain. Very good right at sight and touch. Crispy bottom, soft bread, right amount of tomato flavor to bread ratio - evenly flavored on all sides (because their squares, equal sides... Is that a chuckle? I'll take it!) Both my slices were exquisitely delicious!There were many pasta dishes. Penne a la vodka was creamy and plentiful in sauce (a little too much, but oh the better to dip with). A simple dish with marinara was still good with tomato pieces within the sauce and the right amount of saltiness.Chicken entree with mushrooms was moist yet lean. However, not the lean-dry texture rather a tender cut with a complementing sauce. It was just good.The lasagna plate was so hefty. Large plate for a large serving of lasagna slices and meat. Hoo, 2 people had a hard time finishing it due to the food choices on the table. Love the cheese placement within this dish because it was just right.All this food, what about the service? Alas, in the beginning, we didn't have immediate attention but it was better and stayed at that level. Our waiter was fantastic - didn't get his name, but so amiable and personal to us. Gave us suggestions and even told us what the cooks there do best (Note, he wasn't evening pointing to expensive plates, rather the cheaper yet overlooked ones) Excellent, excellent, superb! Hell, he would've done extraordinarily well during these recent presidential debates, just saying.To top off the night, we exited to get some ice cream outside. Spumoni was tasty and smooth plus comes in a decent size for the price. The prices overall were reasonable for dessert.Total price for the night doesn't compare to the food, service, and atmosphere in my opinion. This place is a joy to eat in and more joyful with a large party.My sister also mentioned the head chef who comes out to greet and treat customers.

How can I accurately describe the perfect combination of cheese, sauce, cheese to thick doughy bread?

But really there's a reason for pizza being the way it is. The cheese here is stuck on the crust. Therefore I barely noticed any cheese and wished I was eating a reg square with some gooey cheese. The crust was a bit too thick and hard. The tomato sauce was on top and when it enters my mouth I get an overwhelming taste of sweetness and acidity from the sauce on top touching my mouth first. No texture at all that reminds me of pizza. At the end of the day, I'd rather go down my block for a square. I wish I tried their spumoni but it was in a separate area and I was double parked because their parking lot was all full! Too bad..

I made a rookie mistake when I first tried here. I ordered a round slice. Round. After noticing how everyone seemed to have square pizzas I quickly picked up their secret. Their square slice is not like a ny slice where its thin like a cardboard. The  square is crunchy on the outside while fluffy on the inside. The sauces is generous on top keeping it nice and moist. They don't go cheap with the cheese either. You get a decent layer of cheese on top.If you aren't feeling pizza they also sell other stuff like ice cream ...pasta...and stuff...I never had anything else there other than pizza but I am sure it's good right? This place is super family friendly. Outdoor seatings are a bit cramped but still enough space to eat. People are so friendly there and treat you like family too so they don't mind you sharing a table if there's no place to sit.

The first time I came here for dinner, I really enjoyed my pasta. There were no complaints! The second time I got food here, was from a takeout pizza. It was rather soft, pretty good, but nothing too special. I came back with my significant other for dinner, and had no major issues with our food. In fact, since we were here rather late, they took off a charge for calamari and our dessert (since they didn't have the ones we asked about). That left a good impression! However, my significant other and his parents have frequently been stating lately that their pizza is getting worse. ""It isn't how it used to be"", they say. Unfortunately, I haven't tried their pizza back in 'the good 'ol days' so I am not one to say. They explained that they were disappointed with a recent experience at the restaurant and would no longer be coming back. Apparently, after ordering calamari as an appetizer, they didn't receive it until the main course had come. They asked to send it back until the course was finished, which they did, but unfortunately it came back cold. When they finally ate it, it wasn't even as good as it used to be. However, they still charged them for the poor quality of an appetizer.However, I personally wasn't turned off by their food. I tried a meatball hero at one point and it was rather good. The meatballs were very moist (maybe a little too moist) but they tasted good. Unfortunately, since it was takeout, they packed it in a way so that the bread and cheese got stuck to the plate and broke off as I ate.",3/14/2013,11,55,82,wRir4skfK09SWXMTl5jCuQ

Quality has dipped a bit. The waiters take your order, maybe bring your drinks, check on you, and then bring your check. Everything is generally handled by the bus boys. I've work in the biz and I don't really like that. I want to be able to deal with my server. It's hard sometimes even getting their attention.

And I love L&B for what it is -- but stacked up next to some of my other favorite pizza places, it's really a bigger gap than one star implies... So don't look at it that way.L&B's pizza doesn't blow my mind the way Totonno's or Di Fara's does. But I love it nonetheless. Here are some important things to consider, based on my many experiences there:1) the L&B experience isn't only about pizza. It's about Brooklyn in summer, spumoni in a ""garden,"" mirrored ceilings, being encouraged to try the ""chef's table"" every time you go, discovering you've been non-consensually served the ""chef's table"" every time you go. 2) But it is also about pizza. SICILLIAN pizza. Do Not Order Thin Crust Pies Here. I disagree with all the snobs who say the thin crust is ""repulsive,"" but I see no point in getting it. Their Sicillian pies are to die for. Truly delicious -- go for the corner slice. (Always go for the corner).3) If they bring you the chef's table -- enjoy the artichoke hearts and seemingly endless parade of entrees you would never have ordered. If you're vegetarian, tell them! to prevent the ongoing arrival of STILL MORE meatballs.4) Enjoy the dusty tray of post-dinner liquors brought to the table for your perusal! THIS IS L&B AT ITS BEST! And if you don't accept a tiny glass of limoncello from the man with the tray... just, WHO ARE YOU? And how did you end up at L&B?5) Let them bring you an enormous spumoni dessert to share with your whole table, and neighboring tables, if we're honest. 6) If the chef comes out to thank you and offers you a size XXXL tee-shirt -- TAKE IT. P.S. As closing time nears, you stand a shot at influencing the music selection and MAY be able to strike up a dance party with the hostess.P.P.S. I felt unsure how to answer the TV question. There are indeed televisions there -- a few, in fact -- but in the main dining room they only show a slideshow of photographs of their own menu items. To be clear: TVs? yes! But is the game on? Definitely not.",7/17/2015,316,69,2,kqfxYdLzCWFbgGB10QXLUw

Usually I go with my friends after school to pick up a slice or two, depending how hungry I am, it fills me up. Their sicilian slices are to die for. They are delicious. Words can't describe how delicious it is. After pizza, it's usually their spumonis. Their spumonis are delicious as well. I definitely recommend to come here.",12/7/2013,1,7,2,hchYDQQgr3XowqWo1VVTRw

My dad introduced me to L&B when I was just a wee youngster, and like many of my fellow Yelpers, I agree that you really haven't experienced amazing New York pizza until you've had a slice from here. I dunno what it is that makes their pies so good-- I've watched their Man v. Food episode and paused it as they make the pizza to scope the ingredients in the background-- but their recipe is incomparable to any other pizza I've had.If you are looking for a super cheesy greasy pie, save your effort and call up Domino's. L&B is light on cheese, and heavier on the awesomeness.",10/16/2012,92,178,1,K3IOje_qyjF1Q3nc926h4w
2007,Elly W.,0,5,"$2.50 for a slice of heavenly squared deliciousness. There will always be a line but the line moves fast. Ordered the round and the square and the square is a MUST! Piping hot, with a good crunch on the bottom of the crust, sweet tomato sauce on top of good quality cheese that leaves a melting string of cheese from the very first bite. 2 slices of the square was enough to fill me.As recommended by yelper, also got the large spumoni rainbow in a cup ($3.50 Large cup & $3.00 small cup) The ice cream tasted minty from the green flavor one, the chocolate was a chocolate icy and there was some nuts in the white. Personally I didn't like it, not worth getting again. Large was enough for 2 people.To venture out from Queens and sit through traffic in the belt pkwy is not worth it unless it's on the way.",6/23/2013,57,204,45,cFDy1uueoSwvJ-PdalSCOA

Although the wait was quite long, the manager immediately plopped down 2 complimentary pasta dishes on our table even before we could open up the menu - wow! Their old fashioned broccoli spaghetti was just divine. Of course, we had to try their namesake pizza and the thick crust, cheesy, saucy goodness definitely did not disappoint. If only it didn't take forever to get here and if only the wait didn't take us 45 minutes. Next time, I may just order to go or eat outside.",1/27/2015,372,656,214,52YAyBT7zJN6EmEfHdrHfA

The sauce is sweet, the dough is soft, and I though for a second I was eating a doughnut! The best part is the thin layer of a greasy, crispy crust on the bottom, that gives you the perfect combination of crunch and sweet dough in your mouth :) L&B is deep in the heart of Brooklyn (2nd to last stop on the N train) might as well make a day out of it and hit up Coney Island afterwards.",9/22/2012,34,89,36,KZxBRoxpCFbXQQFLv_5goQ
2013,David S.,0,4,"L & B is always a fun place to stop off.  It's best feature is the super low stakes - you can always find a table in the outside seating area and the line for squares moves nice and fast, so you are pretty much guaranteed to be stuffing your face within a few minutes of arrival.  Now, let's be honest here -- describing the Sicilian squares as ""the best in the city"" or anything like that is misleading.  It's total junk food and somewhat inconsistent.  However, the way they've flipped the standard formula by dumping the sauce on top the cheese is brilliant, so what you get is a chewy, gooey, saucy mess.  Usually, it hits the spot, and if your piece sucks you can always toss it, get back in line, and try again.The counter inside for heros and salads and such can be pretty frustrating.  On a busy day you might end up waiting a half hour for their (delicious) pear salad or some other item you didn't realize would be back-ordered.And since everybody goes here the people watching is absolutely superb.",2/1/2014,6,32,0,OfYdi2XBgF_TbQVQfoTwyg

2016,Sam M.,0,5,Let me start off by saying I live right around the corner from this place. During the summer time it is packed with everyone and their mothers. Gets me frustrated coming home from work trying to look for a parking spot. But this review is for the Sicilian squares only which is what everyone should get when coming first time to this place. I don't really enjoy the Italian dining here but the Sicilians squares are amazing. It is meant to be eaten right away and tastes the best when it is fresh and hot out the oven. The sauce along with the salty crust is always what I enjoy the most out of this place. If you have room for dessert head on over and get a pistachio spumoni to top off a good night.

2020,Alexandra K.,0,3,"I found a Sicilian pizza place and needed to see if it was all that the Food Network hyped it up to be--actually I just really needed to see if any other square pizza could trump Buddy's in Detroit.  L & B puts the cheese above the dough and then the sauce above the cheese so you get A LOT of sauce (yum!)This is actually the original location and is still family-owned.  Ludovico Barbati came to the U.S. in 1917 and started selling his products in a horse & buggy.  When he became popular he decided to buy the vacant property on 86th St. in Brooklyn and built a structure to make the Spumoni and Ices.  In 1950 they built the second of the three buildings to sell pizza out of and later added the third building which is now the restaurant.  -Sicilian Square Slice: the sauce is delicious--a bit like tomato pasta sauce and what's nice is that even though there is so much of it, it doesn't fall off! But the semi-tasteless dough is overwhelming. Not enough cheese in my opinion. The crust is actually good because it's cheesy, garlicky and chewy. But Buddy's is still the king of square pizzas. -Rainbow Spumoni (pistachio, chocolate & vanilla): Woah. Your initial reaction is omgosh this is too sweet. But then you taste the bits of pistachio and it's quite good. Like there are actual pieces of pistachio in there. The chocolate, when you can get some has a strong taste and the vanilla also has a great flavor. I was surprised by how much I liked it.  What is spumoni exactly?  It's typically three flavors of ice cream with a fruit/nut layer in between.  FINAL VERDICT: If you are close to Coney Island visit the place.  It's nice because you can either eat in or just grab however many slices you want and sit at a table outside.  You can then grab some ice cream once you are done enjoying your pizza.  The pizza is certainly good, but the dough they used just didn't make me crave more.  I really did like the Spumoni though.  It's also nice just to see the locals who obviously come here a lot and to see the Italians that have been here for generations amidst the new population of folks in the area.",6/26/2013,47,321,515,uKSfqdoqE8ESJ53pW35Tag

2024,Mieshie M.,0,5,Fluffy Clouds of Pizza!! It's Haven in a Box! Need I say more! This is hands down one of the best and only places I will get Upside Down Pie... For those from out of town.. Its where they put the cheese down first on the dough and then the sauce! A half a tray will run you about $20 bucks and will feed 3 - 5 people nicely. If you need more get yourself a full tray and take some home and freeze it for another time! and it still taste as good as it did the first time you got it!!!  When you are done with eating pizza you need to get a cup of either their Spumoni or a cup of their delicious Creme Cycle as it is my all time favorite.

I'm a traveling guidette, I've been all over the place and nothings ever come close!Their secret is their fresh buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomato sauce and Pecorino Romano cheese. Their crust cannot be described in words. I grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and had L&B every weekend for the first 20 years of my life. Their pies aren't as cheap as some but you get what you pay for. For the quality ingredients they use, in the 80 year old brick oven,-- it's worth every dollar. I admit I've called and asked if they would ship frozen pizza cross country *Blush*",3/15/2013,1342,135,130,UUVbV8XmTzNksBOPaiO3pA
2030,Tom M.,0,5,"It looked so good on Man vs. Food that I had to try it. I took the N train to 86th Street. I stepped out to see a neighborhood not unlike the one I taught in for two years in the South Bronx. Across the street from the subway is a huge sprawling housing project. On the walk to L&B you pass a C Town grocery store and a check cashing place. As I look at a map now, I can see that perhaps I would have missed this if I had gotten off one stop before at Avenue U. Next to the housing project is a luxury condominium building and across from that is L&B.I ordered a slice of Sicilian. $2.25, a decent price for a big slice. They have a whole pie at the outside counter and you can ask for a middle, corner or edge. I liked that. I went middle. My first bite or two it was too hot. You have to wait a minute to cool off just enough that you're not just tasting hot.Then the party started. This pizza is an example of the magic that happens when food is exactly the right texture. Let's build up from the bottom. The bottom crust is perfectly crisp. The bread above that is a perfect soft and not too chewy texture. Its almost airy in there. On Sicilian that can be topped with sogginess from sauce. Not so here. The bread is topped off with the melted mozzarella. It is the perfect top. It is almost like an open-face grilled cheese sandwich made with pizza dough and mozzarella. Then topped with a great red sauce. The highlight of the sauce is the parmesan and/or romano sprinkled on top. Its aroma and taste combine to form the nicotine of this cigarette. I went back and ordered a second slice. I'd be lying if I didn't admit I considered ordering a third. But I had to save some room for the next treat, pistachio spumoni.I ordered a small cone of it, again setting me back $2.25. There is plenty on a small cone. The color is a very bright and artificial green. No matter, whatever chemical causes this green, its not detracting from taste. Again, the texture is a major success. Not creamy and melty but not ice either. Didn't drip. Also, the spumoni has bits of pistachio pleasantly sprinkled in. The taste is fantastic. Wonderfully pistachio. What would win a pistachio triple-threat match, L&B spumoni, Shriver's in Ocean City's pistachio fudge or Bobby's Burger Palace's pistachio milkshake? I don't know. So I paid $6.75 for two slices of great pizza and a delicious spumoni. They only have cans of soda there so I just used my water bottle. This place is a find.

This place is illegal in 7 countries. I mean the food is outstanding. Da-best. I went here for a my gf's grandma's 90th bday party. Everything was family style. I will try to recollect what we had but I am still in a food coma. They brought out apps by the truck full or at least it looked that way. A few personal pizza's to start to sample. Oh-my-god. Probably one of the best pizza I have ever had. It was so soft, the sauce was so fresh, the toppings were delicious. Everything was perfect together. Then the salad came out...I tried it to feel as though I had some greens in me. Then the clams oreganato: great but dry crumbs...still excellent. Then came out the mozzarella in carrozza (so freaking good), then the rice balls (amazing) and you would think it would stop there...oh no. Time for the pasta (ziti in bolognese sauce and spaghetti in clam/garlic sauce), both were very good. The best part of the meal (other than the dessert) were the stuffed artichokes...holy cow they were superb! Stuffed with breadcrumbs and shrimp...yummy! I tried to slow down but it really wasn't working. So there was a 30 minute break and all of a sudden sliced steak cooked to perfection (family style), grouper and broccoli rabe were brought out. You wouldn't think the steak would be great but it was so good I overloaded on it. I tried the grouper but I am not much of a fish eater...it was ok. The broccoli rabe was good as well. So I think that's it...really...is that a boat of ice cream coming out...seriously...oh my...yeah it is....there was cheesecake and ice cream and chocolate cake and their world famous spumoni...Now if you have never had spumoni, you need to go here to truly witness the best you will ever have...I can go on and on but seriously everything I tried/over loaded on was awesome. Their service was top notch. The staff was super friendly, funny, attentive and really made a special day even more so.

The difference between those two still not clear to me tho haha.I would definitely go back for their pizza.",7/27/2013,37,23,1,xSzdUrOhziE_RhJO1PhtJQ

2055,Anthony F.,0,5,I have so many memories at L&B. Besides that fact that there's no other square that can beat it. Growing up right across the street as a kid was a big treat in itself. Till this day it's a nice treat to go and have a few squares and then the Spumoni after of course. The sausage and pepper hero will always remind me of the 18th Ave Feist. Omg.

2057,Daria Z.,0,4,"Great pizza. I had the regular slices and some square slices. Square slices are much thicker, have a fluffier crust, and less cheese than regular slices. Not gonna change your world if you've grown up in Brooklyn and been surrounded by NYC pizza, but pretty damn good for the price. I had spumoni ice cream afterwards. Honestly, the sizes for ice cream and ices are too small for the price they list, but it's all homemade so I guess that justifies it. If you've never had it before, it's less creamy than ice cream but too creamy to be an ice, and tastes strongly like pistachio, swirled with chocolate and vanilla and the teeniest tiniest hint of mint. Tasty, but probably wouldn't get it again.",11/25/2015,0,5,0,KDSWbDiXjDlvOzYkJGBOKA

2068,Luisa R.,0,4,One of my favorites. We order from here often. Half a tray means 12 square slices of heaven. The seafood is fantastic with big portions. I love the fried calamari. The pasta dishes are good but I'm a little bit bias because I'm Italian. We usually order for pick up because delivery could take an hour or sometimes more. (I only live about 12 blocks away.) This is the reason why I didn't give 5 stars. But when I order for pick up and tell them it is for Russo my order is always ready and waiting.,7/7/2015,79,36,8,UcSYFNJjKYrnPjaUT226pw
2069,Alice W.,0,4,"You go there and notice it's obviously a neighborhood favorite, but didn't stand in line for more than 3 minutes because they have a smart set up: pizza on the left, dessert in the middle. I tried their Spumoni ice yesterday and not sure what's not to like. The texture was perfect, felt like the in between of ice cream and icee. The spumoni flavors, which consisted of pistachio, chocolate and vanilla were unexpectedly, refreshingly complimentary. Also, wanna know what else is pretty cool? They have a parking lot. Ohhhh yea, a parking lot in NYC is like a short line at Shake Shack. Score.This review will be completed when I go back for their pizza, but from the smells of it, there's only going to be an upward trend. ENJOY!",7/5/2013,13,35,6,_5ZtEp1FDAPAsp2s9Fw3VA

2071,Luke W.,0,4,"Once again, another reason to be a proud Brooklyn Native.Not much to say, really.  Don't get a slice, get the square.  If you want to experience the hype, please oblidge to that.Ended up eating 4 squares in about an hour span last weekend, was so worth it.The sauce is more on the sweet side, but it's a good complement to the cheese which is underneath.Wait times are minimal, and there are multiple seats, both indoors and outdoors.  Don't expect to spend a lot of dough, as everything is somewhat reasonably priced, even considering inflation in the last 10 years or so.Really, it's all about the uniqueness of the pizza taste, which is not duplicated.  Granted, there are a lot of other excellent pizza places similar (DiFara's, Grimaldi's, etc), but they really don't deserve to be compared to one another.  They all bring a unique flavor (no pun intended) and all have something to bring to the table (pun intended!).If you want to be Brooklyn-ized, go to this place.  This reminds me of what Brooklyn was, which is starting to change.The food menu is pretty solid too, they have a number of different sandwiches.  Aside from being a hamburger conoseur, I happen to like many-a-chicken parm.  They also bring a quality hero as well.Get the square if your're smart, and you won't be disappointed.Three Cheers for L & B!",8/10/2012,228,113,10,JLqAAJB8IYQui1APfZfgOg

I ordered pizza here once or twice in the past and found it no where near the magnificence of some of the other pizza places in the area.  During a recent trip back home to visit, decided to give it one last try since we were driving by.  The pizza was thinner than I remembered; they use bland sauce & little cheese on the square slices. The regular slice was boring and paper thin, and I'm not talking GOOD thin, like characteristic NY pizza... I'm talking school book loose-leaf paper thin. (Their margins must be splendid.) It actually reminded me of one of those new $1 pizza places in Manhattan that have been popping up in the last few years.

I felt like our server - an older gentleman - could have been my Italian grandfather. He did forget that we ordered a pizza after we finished our delicious (and huge) Caesar salad, but he was really funny about it (and the pizza was already cooking anyway), so no harm, no foul.The pizza was absolutely delicious. So warm, soft and tasty. I know lots of people here like the corner pieces most, but even though I typically enjoy crust, I liked the middle pieces best. They allowed for maximum sauce space to cover with grated cheese, oregano and garlic. There were three of us and we ordered a 12-piece Sicilian pie. While we only ended up eating eight slices total, it was still cheaper to order the pie than order individual slices. I think the average person, though, would be easily satisfied - dare I say full - after enjoying just two slices.Can't wait to return and try some of the appetizers and pasta dishes.

To add insult to injury, while I was eating I watched the staff prepare the pizza pans and I cannot see how everyone who eats there does not get sick because their prep methods are highly unsanitary.

2106,Cynthia W.,0,1,"Being a staple of the Brooklyn pizza scene, I expected better from the all around menu. I love the square pizza but the other food I had left much to be desired.  The wait for the food was extensive.The potato croquettes were dry, the calamari had no flavor and tasted stale, the marinara sauce tasted like it came from can to plate (like tomato sauce, again, no flavor), and subsequently all the dishes that had that sauce (chik parm, spaghetti, etc) had no flavor. The penne a la vodka was different from a traditional kind and had little sauce.  The one dish with adequate flavor was the chicken Marsala. Also, the Bellini frozen drink was delicious and refreshing.",8/7/2014,35,14,10,sQEwms-cbGzGswXydUxMPA

My friend and I always get at least half a tray to go because its sooooo far for us (42 miles one way) and we don't know when we are gonna get the chance to come back!My recommendation is to get the pizza from the side and sit on one of the benches outside. For some reason I find that the pizza is always better then eating inside for what reason I do not know it all comes from the same place. The service inside is terrible and the other dishes are ok nothing to rave about ... so pretty much just stick to the square slices and you'll be more than happy!!!",7/11/2010,95,151,353,-tvkjRNyZkIB3ndIftI7Yg

2123,Jeffrey T.,0,4,"My wife and I recently stopped here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" (highly recommend!) and definitely enjoyed the pizza and spumoni.  We had slices of the simple Sicilian cheese pizza and I must say that I've never had anything quite like it.  I've had plenty of similar pizza (square, sicilian style, thicker crust), but nothing that compared in terms of crust.  The way they layer the cheese on top of the crust (in between the bread and sauce) in order to keep the crust intact is genius!  If you didn't know it, you might think the crust was a little ""doughy"", but that's actually the layer of pecorino romano!  It really does keep the crust dry so you can enjoy that nice, flaky, light and airy goodness!  The sauce is definitely a little sweet, but very good!If you like sicilian style pizza (and even if you don't), you definitely must try this place!  And be sure to give the spumoni (I recommend pistachio) a try too, it was excellent!Although we visited in winter (it was cold) and ate inside, they have plenty of outdoor seating and this looks like an excellent place to enjoy the weather and some great food on a nice day!Positives: Great pizza (the crust and sauce stand out), excellent spumoni, historic/famous place, lots of seating both outdoors and indoors.",2/24/2013,26,137,356,Fsbj4RkMx41eK8gymtAnrg
2124,John B.,0,5,"A lot of people are ordering weird, elaborate meals here. Why you'd do this is beyond me, unless your idea of culinary majesty involves catering halls. It might be a good catering hall, but that's immaterial.You're here for the sheet pizza. Unless you live in Bensonhurst or Gravesend, it's kind of a haul to get out here, so you might want some simple salads to make it a balanced meal. That's fine. A green salad is OK; the calamari salad is pretty good.It may be weird to think of the sheet pizza as ""pizza."" It's sui generis, even as square pies go. The sauce is sweet and well herbed. I'd guess it's been cooked longer and slower than most pizza sauces. The crust is thick and doughy, but also charred and crispy at the edges.I was kind of between four and five stars. But L&B is an institution. It reminds me of everything I liked about growing up here and about working in south Brooklyn. A multigenerational clientele. Regulars who know the staff on a first-name basis. A muscleman at the table next to you who's wowing his date by ordering enough food to feed a family of 10. Little kids who spend their entire Sunday afternoons whipping themselves into a delirious frenzy of anticipation at the thought of the enormous spumoni they're going to get if they behave themselves.And of course, those mirrored ceilings.

2125,Colleen L.,0,5,"This place. Oh my god. I really don't know what else to say about it - it was truly the greatest ice cream ever.It was a Friday night at the end of summer, the temperatures were starting to turn and the skies threatened rain. Needing as much of an urban escape as a girl can get before the bars, and a bit of a workout, I grabbed my bike and headed to Coney Island to watch the sunset. It was quite lovely. However, such activities leave a girl hungry, and the fairground setting made me feel all giddy and kid-feeling. This calls for ice cream, and ice cream only.I biked through deepest suburban Brooklyn in search of the Magical Spumoni Wonderland I had heard so much about (thx Yelpers!). Lo and behold, there on a corner I saw the glowing sign and the bajillion people. Hooray!!Now, the pizza looks amazing, but nothing stands between me & my ice cream. Nothing. Once I saw all the wonderful frozen deliciousness, I'll admit I was a little overwhelmed - would I pick the best one?! Well, whether I did or not, what I picked was frickin great. I went for the real, traditional spumoni: vanilla, chocolate & pistachio mixed. The best kind of rainbow there is. You must try it. You must!!As I sat there at the outdoor picnic tables licking melting spumoni off my fingers, surrounded by mostly Italian families stuffing their faces with pizza and ice cream, I decided that marrying a guido might be my goal in life. If being a mafia wife meant all the spumoni & blingin jewelry I could handle, I'm there (literally, there at L&B, every day).",2/18/2011,266,330,61,Jl788GK1eIie4EWbfcUqxg

2134,Jonathan P.,0,5,"This is the best Sicilian Pizza I've ever had; I prefer traditional style by far, but this is Sicilian style that's impossible to pass up if you're as big of a pizza lover as I am.  The lines can get quite long, but the guys quickly turn these pizzas out as they restrict no toppings on single slices; I don't mind because I think this helps move things along quickly.  Typically, most people order a half-tray (12 slices) or a whole tray (24 slices).  I grabbed a half tray with my dinner date for the evening, and before I knew it I stuffed 4 slices down my gullet.  Like I said before, I'm not the biggest fan of Sicilian, but I am definitely fan of the greatest pizza sauce I've ever tasted.  While I have my go-to spots for slices of cheese, and my gourmet gems for my favorite style (Brick-oven that is), I've never had a pizza sauce better than Spumoni Gardens.  It had the right amount of sweetness to it and the perfect dashes of herbs and seasonings, accentuating the tomato flavors in all the right ways.Some other reviewers said there could be more cheese on these slices, and while I'm an avid cheese lover, that's not what this pizza is meant to be.  It's meant to be a tribute to what traditional Italian pizza sauce should taste like.  If it were loaded with cheese, it would definitely add greasiness and take away from the purity of the crispy Sicilian shell and the perfection of the best pizza sauce ever.  I wish I could tell you about more food options here (like the 4 different types of hero's the table next to me ordered looked amazing), but sadly the pizza was all I had room for.  I tried some of the Vanilla Chip water ice later on and was not a fan; it wasn't bad but it was also WATER ICE (icy, chipped) not ITALIAN ICE (creamy, smooth).  I'm usually not that picky, but being in Brooklyn and having such good pizza, I expected more from the water ice.Do yourself a favor, in fact do your whole family a favor, pick up a whole tray of sicilian and bring it home for everyone to enjoy!",8/28/2012,749,52,38,cMPJlsuY5IQgJ8N9qICdDw

2141,Jasmine L.,0,5,"Made the trek out last Saturday night to try the World Famous Sicilian Pie. Not only was I not let down by the pizza, my entire experience while there was pretty fantastic. 2 of my friends and I went closer to closing time, so there was no wait to get seated indoors. The pie came out pretty quickly too and did not disappoint! We got pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. The base was deliciously doughy and crust was nice and crispy, tomato sauce was on the sweeter side (I really like that though), and I don't know what kind of mushrooms they use, but they sure are yummy! Really sad that I couldn't eat more than 2 slices (I know, weak!). The people who run this place are absolute sweethearts as well. We were loitering at our table because 1) maybe we were secretly wondering if any of us could fit another slice in, and 2) we were trying to figure out what bars were in the area that we could head out to. We asked one of the many nice servers for suggestions, and he didn't hesitate to give a genuine, helpful answer. Then, as we were loitering around some more, instead of being like many other places would probably be giving us signals that we needed to get out, they said they were going to give us dessert and offered us cappuccinos as well! I was expecting a scoop of Spumoni or something, but no...they came out with their crazy huge dessert plate that was chock full of everything (cheesecake, chocolate covered chocolate and vanilla Spumoni topped with pistachio Spumoni, sprinkle covered ice cream cones...!) I especially liked the ice cream cone (cause who doesn't like ice cream cones, and I liked the sherbet that filled the cone) and the chocolate covered Spumoni - vanilla especially was suuuper thick and creamy.My experience was top-notch, which is why I'm not hesitating to write a review to toot their horns - L&B deserves it.",4/28/2015Updated review,76,9,5,Gb0y_4AlYbsbQyPMikN9pQ

People standing and sitting around holding their pizza and/or spomoni, eating and enjoying the summer in Brooklyn. I liked the Spumoni but it wasn't anything that special, just good.Inside the dining area reminded me of Lundy's in Sheepshead Bay. Very busy, tables close together, lot so waiters hussling around. It's a food factory atmosphere. Even tho the wait staff was a bit in a rush, they were curteous and proficient.The food was very good and the main ingredient in each dish was ABUNDANT!

I'd had it before when I stayed over at a friend's house in Bensonhurst and her family ordered delivery. It was L&B Spumoni, and I was like woah - this is the best delivery pizza I have ever had. Still rings true to this day.The square slice is crisp at the bottom, soft and doughey in the middle (not in a nasty way), and the sauce is on top of the cheese for this pizza. I'm not sure if the cheese-sauce role reversal makes a huge difference in how the slice turns out, but it doesn't hurt.

The reason being are the following:# 1 Main Reason was Service-I had the waiter acknowledge me only when I placed my order and upon receiving my check. The waiter never once asked me during my dining experience if I need anything additional, or how my food was etc. If Im paying for waiter service that is normally typical waiter 101 to ask question about my experience. I also ordered food in which I requested a box to take it home with but instead it was thrown away. Also, everyone else seem to have received a bread basket.  In addition, I had a dining guest with me through out my dining experience-Mr. FLY.

2153,Megan C.,0,4,"L&B has spumoni and Silician pies down to a science. After a long, hot day at Coney Island, a group of us head to L&B's to refuel. We sat inside (so mother freaking hot and sweaty out there), and while we had to wait a while for someone to come to the table, the guy who finally did was awesome. Like, just a really good guy. I would be friends with him. So friendly and conscientious. Love that. He got us going with pitchers of ice water and huge baskets of bread and SO much soft butter. I HATE hard as rock butter that destroys and mangles my bread and this place seems to know what's up.We got a caesar salad and 1/2 Sicilian pie with pepperoni. There were four of us and the 1/2 pie was plenty. I've heard the whole pie is the size of a football field or something. The dressing on the caesar was really good, but there was a little too much of it...something you'll rarely hear me complaining about. The pie was good, really good, with a unique almost lasagna-like sauce. It just proved to me, though, that I really am more of a thin-crust person. Not L&B's fault.I got a cup of mint chocolate chip ice cream (had to...it's my fave and I was coming off a looooong diet) and we got this huge volcano of a dessert whose name I can't remember. The bottom is a ball of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with a hard chocolate shell and it's piled high with decadent spumoni. I think there was also some kind of raspberry sauce and whipped cream. Ridiculous, you guys. Just out of this world.Best part? The tab for four of us stuffing ourselves silly? $50. HEY-O!!!",8/19/2015,236,265,45,iGrz2UMM9xwnEfrtS9fWdw

2159,Megan K.,0,3,"I feel like this place was extremely hyped up between Man Vs. Food and all the extremely positive reviews. I made the trek from Lower Manhattan, so perhaps that is persuading my perception of the pizza, but I didn't think it was everything Yelpers cracked it up to be. My boyfriend and I arrived here around 11:45am on a Monday, so the pizza by the slice was piping hot and ready to be served up. We wanted to try the Sicilian after reading the reviews that their thin crust was just a-ok. I was disappointed to see that you couldn't get any of the pizza by the slice with any toppings, so we had to settle for cheese. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't anything... special. The crust had a great flavor to it and was airy, the sauce was flavorful and tomatoey, and the cheese was your standard mozzarella. The service was friendly at the window, and the atmosphere was alright, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the pictures.I'd probably take my Brooklyn pizza ventures elsewhere.",11/11/2015,46,187,29,rtFI0_GrbF6boXFgxXCxPw

Come here to eat pizza, that is a good thing, then finish off your meal with the best and only spumoni around. That is great and what gives this place a 3 star rating. If the restaurant were 1/3 as good as the square pizza, this place would rate 5 stars.The food is just ok here. The service is HORRIBLE. We used to come regularly last year and years before and the experience was worth waiting for. Tonight, the waiters sucked eggs. They were way too young, inattentive, and they had a flock of busboys and servers that reflected truly poorly on the place. I thought, man, this is really ghetto now. Add to that, the stupidity of them, I asked them to wrap the left over calamari, and forget the garlic bread, and i come home to find the exact opposite. It isn't too much to expect the service people to speak english, is it??So, save your money for pizza and spumoni and the heck with the bad restaurant with crap service.",9/21/2012,12,49,0,GVwUupWmkLD3Nh_KyHMmcA

It has been on various food shows, friend of mine from Pittsburgh wanted to go when they came out here.  Here is the deal with the square pizza....it is really different, and really good in it's way, but it doesn't really seem like ""pizza"" to me.The crust is a thick thick light and airy dough underneath coming out to a crispy crust at the end.  About 2.5 inches thick this pizza.  On top is a lot of tomato sauce which is very tangy.  And very little cheese.  So it's like a huge delicious piece of bread with tangy tomato sauce on it.  Prices are good, I've only gone to the outdoor part.  There is a giant covered tent so you can go there in hot weather and not bake in the sun outside.....",8/2/2014,4,6,1,vHnZbmX6DCJZS92w0RC3lA

I could just go to some random pizza store and buy a pie and would be more satisfied. I don't know about anyone else, but the sauce was salty to me, I suppose some of the people I shared it with also agreed it was salty too. It just didn't sit right. Pizza isn't pizza if the sauce was not right and the lack of cheese. Crust and dough was burnt every time we had this. It looked like someone just vomited their pasta dinner onto the pie. I gave 2 too many chances. This place is just ok, not blown away and not quite understanding what the hype about the pizza is about. The staff here never seemed friendly to me, they weren't mean but they weren't welcoming either especially if you're slow in ordering or not sure what you want, you might irritate them. They seem to look miserable every time I go. WIth that being said, they make the sicilian pie at a very fast rate. It took literally 5 minutes and they tossed the box at the counter for me to take.

The extra star is for the parking lot. This place comes with its own parking lot. Who the f*ck has their own parking lot in NY??! FEEL FREE TO DRIVE HERE! I had a slice of both regular and square. The regular was regular, the square was interesting. It's just sauce on top. Both slices were very fresh as each pie is sold off quickly. You will hear the word ""NEXT"" here more than in any other place in our observable universe. My favorite part about this place (besides the AMPLE parking) was the seating. It's just a bunch of picnic tables outdoors which is awesome in the summer. It's akin to being in a convertible. Yeah A/C is nice in a car but really there's nothing like a convertible. Unless it's like 103 degrees out and humid. In cosmic terms 103 is extremely temperate. By now you should know that I'm watching replays of the Cosmos TV series. In all would I come back?

The restaurant setting is not that great, but nice for little occasions. The only other worthwhile thing here is the spumoni, OBVIOUSLY!  Seriously though even with those cons, the one pro outweighs it all; it is worth taking the D or N train into Brooklyn for this pizza.

Today I chose a beautiful summer day to drive to my old Brooklyn favorite for a few delicious Sicilian squares and a delectable cup of Spumoni.  As it has been for the last 50 years that I have known this spectacular place, cars were double parked, lines were formed to order and it's as if all of Brooklyn had the same idea as I did.Two glorious pieces of pizza were consumed first. The second square was right out of the oven. Sauce was sweet, olive oil was lightly pooled on top and below the most delicious sauce on the planet was the moist and silky mozzarella cheese melted to perfection! L&B know that the cheese belongs between the dough and sauce not on top of the sauce. This is what allows the crust to be light but crispy on the bottom! Perfection!As for the cup of spumoni I feasted on after wards, a happy ending to say the least!  The spumoni here is creamy but not too creamy, sweet but not to sweet, refreshing with just the right amount of almonds that has you opening up the cup to scoop out the last of this delectable, almost sinful dessert!If your from Brooklyn, you know exactly what I'm talking about!  If your not an haven't been here, this place must be on your lists of places to go in your life!

After being asked if we were in line by a man, the same man proceeded to cut us in line anyway(and the 10 people behind us!). Then I went to get a table while my husband waited for the pizza. A couple left and I sat down at the table to wait. This woman, her husband, her friend, and three kids just sit down at my table and the woman claimed I took her table after she put down the pizza.

2197,Topher N.,0,3,"My mom wanted to go to a good old fashioned Brooklyn Italian joint while in town.  I happened to hear about this place on Top Chef awhile back, and a couple co-workers recommended it so I decided to take the long ass train ride from Queens to Bay Ridge to take my folks here.  In short, it was exactly as I expected it:  Family owned and operated for 70 years, hearty portions,  reasonable prices, where the locals eat, tacky decor, and yummy food.  The three of us shared a Cesar salad ($8) which was a perfect starter salad portion to share between 3-4 people.  The lettuce was definitely fresh, and the dressing was exceptional.  I've never tasted a dressing so thick in my life - almost like melted cheese.Dad got oven baked lasagna ($13) A generous portion with clear layers of tasty sauce, sausage, and ricotta.  Mom and I split a portion of Linguini with Vodka sauce.    Between the two of us we couldn't finish it.  I was looking for something creamy, but was also in love with the idea of a tomato sauce, so it was the perfect marriage of both.  Spicy and sweet with lots of mushrooms, it was fantastic.  As I said, the Decor is Family Italian tacky.  That kind of tacky that says ""This place is the bomb.  Eat here""  Most of the others in the joint seemed like regular patrons who know the menu like the back of their hand and come back again and again (for good reason)  The service proved to be an issue.  I'll preface this by saying we got there at a bad time as two large parties (the smaller of the the two was about 25 folks) were just getting in so the wait staff was rather stretched.  But, it did take nearly 5 minutes before anyone came to say hello and every bit of service we got the whole time we were there seemed like a side thought (as in ""Here's your food.  Hope you like it.  I've got bigger fish to fry."") We paid the bill, then ran out to get some of this famous Spumoni.  In short, the spumoni is the shit.  Yep.  That's all I can really say.  It's DAMN GOOD.  $2.25 for a small is all you really need after a hearty lunch.  All in all, this is a great ""establishment"" restaurant whose food lives up to it's esteem.  However, the lackluster service makes you feel like an outsider if you don't weigh 350lbs, or have 4inch red lacquer nails and a perm.  Great food, go if you are in the area.",4/19/2012,40,60,0,65pYBzwQs5YxorrsJUfAqg

2202,Maralee S.,0,1,"I wanted so badly to like Spumoni Gardens. Friends insisted that my first experience was a fluke. So I gave it another shot. I should have stuck to my guns. The first time we were outside and it was a mob scene to get a square. Rudest patrons ever. And the food? Meh. It's alright. Good enough to warrant the crowd? Not hardly. The next time, we got a table inside for our small group. Right from the beginning, the service was terrible. Our waiter gave us no time to even look at the menu before he came to take our order. We put in the kids' orders and asked for water for the table. And then we pretty much didn't see him again. The kids' food, four meals total, came out in two parts - after having to re-order two of the meals. The water for the table became a precious resource. We had to chase the server down to put in the adults' food order. The food took forever. The server was practically invisible. I watched the tables around us turn over repeatedly while we languished, picking food from the kids' plates and sharing ice cubes for hydration, hoping our food would be next. When the food actually came out, orders were wrong. Pieces were missing. We found a wire twist tie inside of one of our meatballs. The food that was supposed to make up for the crowd and the bad service turned out to be standard pizzeria fare - nothing special and certainly nothing worth the hype. The restaurant itself isn't that special either. We couldn't get around the floors for the olive oil slicks everywhere. The Spumoni was good. I think that was the meal's saving grace. That and the good company. Nothing else about this place warrants a second glance.",8/11/2012,3,43,1,8Aw6aL92Mi7ffkP1LHYUtg
2203,Trey R.,0,5,"What everyone else (including the Travel Channel) says about Spumoni Gardens is true.  The name might reek of spumoni, but huge slices of sicilian pizza are what people come for.  I visited back in April of 2012 and got a sicilian pie with pepperoni.  Easily the best sicilian slice I've ever had.  The dough is so perfectly cooked that even the parts of the slice without cheese felt gooey, buttery and easy to nom on.  The sauce is on the sweeter side, but it works perfectly with the way they make their pizza.  The spumoni looked awesome, but I was insanely full after a couple slices and didn't get to try it.It was quite a trek out here from Fort Greene, but well worth it and I cannot wait to come back.",4/2/2013,24,37,3,61pzkWulmHEXZKQX3Nf-uA

2220,Sandy C.,1,4,"A few things I noticed that makes this place special and very different from other Pizzerias (For the Sicilian/Spumoni Pies):1)  They do not use shredded mozzerella!  I saw a guy in the back of the place, slicing mozzerella from a cheese log (just like they do in Deli's) with a slicing machine.2)  The slices of mozzerella go onto the pie first, then a nice layer of sauce over it.  Not the other way around like everyone else does.3)  Grandma slices are only seasonal.My Sicilian was perfectly done.  Crisp buttery crust on the bottom, 1"" thick bread crust, and just the basic toppings of freshly sliced mozzarella & sauce.I'll be back, and until then I'm withholding one star.  I know that seems wrong, but what's wrong is that Basil isn't available in the winter therefore no Grandma slices.",1/23/2010,250,579,469,sXtYdtCP3Ew1gHfxJxk51w

2223,Diana A.,0,4,"First timer...in my 30-something years living on this Earth, aka Brooklyn, I have never been to this establishment. So, without further adieu, here are my thoughts:1. First impression given while calling this place before the intended time to arrive is not good. I called their direct number---wanting to arrive at 7pm for a party of four people; there is an automated message that prompts you to choose from dining area, ice cream or pizza. After about three times of calling and getting a, ""This party is not available"" message I got fed up and called the regular pizza area, at which point, the phone was picked up promptly, but the gentleman answering the phone was quite strange (upon asking is this ""Spimonte"", I got a few feed backs of, ""Who?""). I then was transferred to the dining area and while waiting for awhile, I was then asked if I wanted to make a reservation for the chef's table, which was to be $50-70 p/p. Seemed a little pricey to me at first, but we made our 7pm reservation regardless; considering it was our first time there, no chances were to be taken. We made the reservation and showed up promptly. So---minus one star for the weird turn out of events on the phone line. 2. Upon siting down, we noticed that our table was not clean at all, with weird spills on the floor and some random plastic bag full of garbage stuffed under the table. They eventually cleaned it to our satisfaction (we were also offered to sit at another table that had recently been opened up: nice), but we chose to keep our seats. It was incredibly busy and packed. We sat down and the bus boy brought our white bread right away. We hoped to get a waiter to talk to us, but to no avail, we received no one. No one came to us to give a menu nor did anyone give us any iced water and after awhile, we were absolutely parched and dying of thirst. We finally had a waiter (later, found out his name is Benny) and he finally explained to us what this Chef's table is. It basically means your table will get a bunch of appetizers, one big pasta plate to share between all, one big plate of meat/fish/steak as a main course to share, a few sides to go along with the main course, essentially unlimited drinks (including alcohol as beer/wine) and one large desert. So we were down to see what this was about...3. For our appetizers, we got a shrimpCocktail with bread-crusted and regular shrimp with few sauces. The bread-crusted shrimp was amazing and the regular shrimp was uneventful. Then we got the fried mozzarella and it was definitely a crowd pleaser, my mom included who doesn't eat anything with tomato sauce. Then it was time for the artichoke. Nothing especially remarkable, but worth mentioning. Then, the large salad was delivered: a little dry for my taste, but some other people at the table were very well pleased. Lastly, we received the baked clams, and those were yummy. Yum yum. During this time, the waiter was in reach for unlimited carafe of wine refills and bus boys asking if we are doing okay (nice touch). We waited a pretty long time for the next batch as we ordered the linguine with clam sauce. A little questionable for my taste, but other people were glued to this pasta (I must say the cooking was done al dente and I loved that texture). We kept the pasta on the table while our main arrived. (We were approached by what looked like the manager, and since there was a huge party of about 20 people next to us, they were kind enough to explain that we could move to the same table behind ours in order to give the bigger party more space to spread out. We didn't mind and moved promptly: even thanked by them. We also asked about this infamous Sicilian slice and the manager was able to bring us a few slices, cut into small pieces, as a thank you for choosing to move). 4. The main course was agreed among the four of us to be a mix of chef's fish over mashed potatoes with shiitake mushrooms and chopped asparagus. We received another two plates of sides: more mashed potatoes and bright green brocoli rabe hearts. The hearts were a bit tough for my taste; my mother absolutely loved them. Mashed potatoes were okay. 5. We were stuffed even before the linguine came out, but were still eager for the next finale. We received a large desert taster: one piece of cheesecake, one of chocolate fudge cake, tartufo cut up into quarters and a large portion of the infamous spumonte. Not bad...definitely filling. I had a cup of cappuccino and I was happy as a clam. They did not have any tea left to us to choose from, which I found strange why aRestaurant would run out of tea on a warm Friday night. Oh well...still other choices were provided and everyone in my party was happy. So, all in all, this is a review not pizza (although Sicilian: good), but for the dining room. We had a great time---family style. Five stars for the food and one removed for the lack of proper functioning phone line that connects to the hostess when calling to make reservations.",5/23/2014,19,15,11,3eCGx8BdZbJlGgnhAomfzA
2224,Jane C.,0,4,"so. i actually dislike sicilian style pizzas. i always think there is way too much dough for the sauce/cheese and i'm all about the perfect combinations and the right proportions of ingredients. but this place is strangely good. its not like you bite into it and have a mouthgasm, but the taste and texture grows on you. i think the pecorino cheese they sprinkle on top i think has a very big role in that. i also like the chewiness of the bread. prefer the plain over toppings.. i think toppings slightly take away from that simple goodness of this pizza. also! they have all different kinds of ice cream! i tried the spumoni - it was a strange experience. the pistachio flavor tastes a little funky but its addicting so you keep taking another spoonful.. my favorite though are the handspun ice cream, which are very rich and creamy. tried tiramisu and strawberry, and they were both delicious, but i liked the strawberry better.",7/2/2014,50,87,46,lXF9TBH9M_fo2DH7DMdUUQ

My bf and I ordered a chicken cacciatore and pasta bolognese, both quite tasty. Halfway into our meal, the chef comes over and offers us a taste of their steak. We were surprised as to how friendly he was! Then he brought over a complimentary plate of fish from the chef's menu and boy were we blown away!! The fish was perfectly grilled and a sweet sauce was drizzled on top. It tasted like a honey/balsamic/fruity explosion in my mouth!  What a nice guy he was, I'll definitely be dining here again.",9/5/2012,76,34,1,vb98Ewp6yqbNROv9vlILsw
2230,Niall B.,0,1,"You have got to be kidding me. Our trek to Coney Island, and then a walk through some of Brooklyn's wastelands, was purposely to have pizza at L&B. The place is a zoo, packed with out-of-towners who don't know good pizza from their arse (and, I suppose, neither did we). The pizza dough was raw, seriously, and I don't think that's a deficiency of an L&B slice but rather a standard. So, loads of raw dough with a meager portion of sauce, cheese and toppings thrown in and what do you get? Super unhappy and never-to-return customers. Leave L&B for those who want to relish in some sort of crappy pizza myth. AND! I live in Brooklyn. Hope springs eternal.",3/26/2014,3,34,0,nUvIt34W7cGkOjY84EjhAQ

It felt sort of like soft chewing gum, you know the kind that is really watery when you first start chewing it.  We called the waiter over and showed him and he brought out a fresh, hot one directly from the oven. It was only slightly better.  Still had a layer of uncooked dough. Hmmmm..not sure what people are raving about. I have had excellent Sicilian red at Rosas in Huntington.  To be fair, the rest of the pizzas at Rosas are mediocre.  I don't think I would make the trip to come back here.",2/16/2012,3,11,2,lac0_u8491Yx0i6v_pX0Mg

2248,Alyssa F.,0,5,"After walking around Brooklyn looking at the pretty Christmas lights, my boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to make a trip here at 11 at night. We had seen this pizza on TV shows and immediately said we had to try it one day. We had already eaten a big meal earlier that night but we didn't care, bring on the pizza!We went inside and there were actually a good amount of people waiting for pizza at the counter. I was a little confused at how the ordering system went. There was one spot where people were going to order whole pies and then other people were just standing around. I asked one employee where do I order and he barely understood what I was asking, so he asked someone else and that guy told me just to wait until a new pie came out. So we waited patiently for the fresh pie to come out to place my order.While waiting, the man who didn't speak much English warmed up a square slice that was sitting out for us to have for free, so nice of him! I guess he felt bad that he didn't understand what I asked him earlier. He even cut it in half for us to share.We ordered 6 slices to go to bring some home for my parents. We couldn't wait to eat them so we sat in the car and ate it. Wow, so good! The taste was different from the slice that was warmed up to the fresh one. Definitely worth the wait for a pie that is freshly coming out of the oven. The crust is perfectly crispy on the bottom and the dough is airy and so good, the cheese and sweet sauce top it off perfectly. I felt like I was in pizza heaven! My parents even enjoyed it after it got cold from the ride to Brooklyn back to Queens. We had a slice left over and I warmed it up the next day in the toaster over and it still tasted good! Will definitely be coming by again (hopefully soon) since my mouth is now watering thinking of this pizza!",1/4/2012,82,220,1,T3S437KP0-Iach7RuAOk4w

2250,Daniel F.,0,5,"I just moved to NY and my buddy recommended this place.  We arrived around 7-8pm on a Saturday and the place was busy.  Since it was just me and the wife, we were seated immediately in a table inside.  Right away I could tell this people meant business, because the waiter was helpful and nice.  It was just the 2 of us, so we didn't want to order a pie, they looked huge.  We were just ordering a couple casual slices, when the manager walks up to us and asks if it was Our First Time?  When we say Yes, he tells us we need the full experience.In they bring us some complimentary mozzarella sticks, that were fresh and fried to perfection.  After that he brings us another complimentary shrimp cocktail with some of the best marinara sauce I've ever had.  We were so surprised we almost turned it away, until he said ""It's on the House"".  The squares were some of the best in the city, and I make an effort to try every pizza joint I walk by.  As we were finishing up, before we could even order anything else, they bring us the cherry on top, some of their classic spumoni! It was all delicious, and the best service I've ever had in a casual joint like this.  As I'm telling the guy I just moved close-by he orders one of the guys to bring some complimentary t-shirts!  I was floored!Great tasting appetizers and squares, great and friendly service.  Don't walk.

2254,Betty T.,0,1,"Terrific food, bad service. The square pizza slices are amazingly delicious -- fluffy dough, light and crispy bottom, but the service is horrendous.Nobody at the front of the restaurant seemed to be in charge and employees told waiting customers they were taking names and told others that they weren't. Another of the employees came out and said he didn't need names because he recognized faces and could remember who was next to be seated. Really?I went with a small group of people and had leftovers. I asked for a box and the waitstaff took my plate and never returned. I got the bill, paid, but said I was still waiting for my leftovers (which was more than 80% untouched) and every person kept telling me that they would go get it for me.After 15 minutes they finally told me the truth -- that the waiter misunderstood me and threw it away. I asked if I was going to get a replacement because I paid for something that only had one bite taken out of it. They didn't appear to be in any hurry to do such a thing, but muttered that yes, they were getting me a replacement. Another 15 minutes later, still nothing.So after 30 minutes of waiting, I had to leave because it didn't seem like I was going to get the rest of my meal back.Good food, but definitely not worth the grief, wait time or headache.

The squares (sicilians) are delicious and the regular slices are good as well. Their ingredients are high quality. The cheese, dough and sauce they use are very good and the standout is the rich, savory sauce. I would rate the slices out of a possible ten..about a 7. The squares are a 9. Awesome. If they were a bit bigger they would be a 10. People eat the pizza outside on the tables they provide, but there is also a restaurant part that serves all sorts of entrees. I had the shrimp parmigiana with pasta and the portion was huge and the price was affordable. They take reservations for this part of their restaurant and accept credit/debit as well.If you happen to be in this part of Brooklyn, then you should definitely stop by and have a bite to eat.",5/25/2015,0,18,0,hmU2H4WjzjcWg2cfRWlW5g

2271,Carly C.,0,5,"There's an interesting phenomenon that occurs here.  I call it the ""Corner Eye Syndrome.""  You'll see it mainly in the dining room and you will undoubtedly catch it too.  On a busy night, you can expect to experience this in frequent intervals.There are a couple of theories currently being evaluated to explain the wandering eyes in the dining room:Does this happen because the entrees are so affordable that it encourages customers to order obscene amounts of food? I witnessed a couple, in fairly good shape, order two appetizers, 4 slices of pizza, one chicken entree and a spumoni dessert.  Keep in mind that all these plates (including the dessert) are quite large.  How can two people order that much food?!Or is it because the food just looks so amazing? A simple glare to your right will help navigate your appetite.  How do they make sausage and broccoli rabe pasta, Sicilian pizza, lobster and even dessert look like art that should be preserved in a museum?!The pizza alone is worthy of a solo exhibition.   This opposite land pizza is assembled with cheese FIRST and covered with this sweet tomato sauce.  Lastly, parmesan is sprinkled on top of the tomato sauce and the crust.  The crust becomes a tasty cheesy breadstick.  The pizza itself is dangerously light giving you the illusion that you can take on more than you can actually handle.Whatever the reason, food is the conversation starter.  Everyone is your friend here.  After all, you and the rest of the room have something in common -- you know good food.",3/5/2012,85,80,34,dXJoHwkNHmbmo6Z-bzowSA

I love triangle slices more because it's thin, crunchy, and the cheese is stringy when I take a bite. I bought 2 slices and it got me really full. Eating the square slice was like eating bread. It was too doughy for me. On the positive side, I liked their sweet tomato sauce and the thick crust. The square slice didn't live up to the hype for me.

The restaurant isn't that big, but they have plenty of tables and room to move around.Most of us got pasta, but some got a salad, and a Chicken Franchese. A Fettuccine Alfredo, two Fettuccine Carbonaros, and Linguine with Vodka sauce. All very hearty italian dishes, but after a while, the oil and cream in the sauce just separated, and it started becoming a oily mess. I've also gotten the chicken parm. hero before, and it was really good. Great sauce to cheese to chicken cutlet ratio, and it was great. I got the fresh chicken cutlets too, and they were still piping hot and even had that freshly fried smell on them. mmmmmm.What L&B's are know for are their sicilian slices. Instead of crust, sauce, cheese, it's crust, cheese, THEN sauce. That makes all the difference. Also, when the weather's nice and warm, get an ice. Doesn't matter which one, just get one.

Prices reasonable, service fast. It's amazing how pizza can look burnt (it isn't) and still taste great. Great crust. They have four connected stores, pizzeria, spumoni/ice-cream/ices, take out Italian food/sandwiches, and a sit down restaurant. All are good.

You will find lots of people who don't like the atmosphere, staff, or lines, but when it comes to the food you just can't deny the goodness that is Spumoni Gardens. The sicilian is amazing. If you like, slightly undercooked dough as I do then you will love this pizza, as the dough at the very top can be a little undercooked and gooey in the most wonderful way. The edges can get a little burnt but somehow even the burnt parts taste wonderful (and I hate burnt crust). The pizza is not heavy as most Sicilian pizzas are, it is as close to perfect as I have ever tasted. I have tried the regular spumoni as well as the pistachio spumoni and do not like either very much. People go nuts for this stuff but am I the only one that doesn't consider this real spumoni??The workers are what you can expect from a Bensonhurst pizzeria. They are loud and rude so check out the menu before you go and be sure to know exactly what you want to avoid getting chewed out for glancing up towards the menu for 10 secs. The atmosphere is crazy and loud in the summer but not in an obnoxious way, for me at least. I have friends who don't like this atmosphere but having lived in Brooklyn when I was a child, that kind of craziness is nostalgic for me. The restaurant is also surprisingly good. The artichoke app is amazing (which I happened to taste when our server ordered one too many and gave one to our table for free), the heroes and rice balls are amazing although the main dishes can be hit or miss. Stick to the francese  and marsala dishes.

2297,Deb L.,0,5,"It's too bad that this place is so far away!!!  Visited this place for a family vacation, after seeing an episode featuring it on Man vs. Food :)  We were there on a Tuesday afternoon, during an odd hour, which meant there was no waiting!  Everything we ordered was really good, and I have to say, I know that everyone raves about the Sicilian Square, which was definitely yummy, but the MEATBALL SANDWICH was soooo delicious!  I thought about it nearly everyday that I was in NY!  The unexpected delight was the calamari!  Such a fair price for a mountain of perfectly made calamari rings!  The outside was crisp, while the squid, itself, was absolutely tender, not overcooked, or rubbery/tough!  We ordered it as an afterthought after seeing a bunch of other tables devouring it.  By the time it came, I was pretty much full, but I still managed to pig out on it.  We couldn't finish it, and it was the ""small,"" and so I had it wrapped up, thinking ""Too bad this won't be as good later..."" -Flash Forward- Hours later: Is that a rumble in my tummy?  Break these bad boys out, and goodness gracious, what a great surprise!  Still tasty!  Even though it was cold, and (sniffle) the breading was no longer crunchy, it still hit the spot!If I'm ever in New York again, you can bet I'll be back at this place.  *My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the spumoni...I know, that's totally ironic.  It was a bit freezer burned...but that aside, since I was really there for the grub, not for the dessert, I had to give it 5 stars.  The price was fair, and the food was good.  If you decide to dine in their outdoor patio, and order from the window, the food is priced less than inside the actual restaurant :)...we ate in because it was chilly, but on a nice, warm, sunny day, it would be perfect!",4/8/2012,20,101,67,GuEJEx0SHhp49uSpqiFa2g

2301,Lauren K.,0,5,"L&B is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.  It is very far on the N train but absolutely worth the trip. Friends and I ordered a pepperoni pie and a plain pie and they were equally fantastic.  L&B is famous for the structure of its sicilian square pizza-- small amount of cheese underneath a generous pouring of sauce. Everything about this pizza is delicious-- the bread was crispy, airy, and by no means burnt. The sauce is fresh and the perfect consistency. I'm a huge cheese fan but the smaller amount on the pizza was no problem. There were plenty of leftovers and the price is extremely good for how much food comes out.  They have an indoor section and outdoor section for eating.  Other reviewers have complained about poor service, but let's be real, you don't come here to be pampered. Order your pizza, eat it, be happy.  Oh, and then go next door to get a spumoni ice.",1/18/2012,38,216,2,OmBCReJ_w9PkhqMPNIMT9g

2303,Johanny M.,0,4,"I was visiting my friends over in Brooklyn and after a while I blurted out that I hadn't had dinner yet. They decided to take me here since they loved it so much and I could see why. Surprisingly for a Saturday night, it wasn't packed at all and the service was fast and friendly. I loved it. And it didn't hurt that 2 slices with a can was just $6! We got ourselves a table and I immediately dug in. The crust was so crunchy and slightly burnt, just how I like it. The dough wasn't chewy at all considering it was fairly thick. I'm a huge fan of cheese and this pizza had a good amount. The sauce was also just awesome. I may or may not have played a little coy in what I really thought to my friends to not seem like a fat ass but really, the pizza is great.

2305,David A.,0,5,"I give the Sicilian pizza and the Spumoni the five stars. Not that you shouldn't try their other food, because it's good stuff but maybe not worth the very highest rating considering some of the other great italian spot in NY. Still, they have a huge menu with lots of good food...I mean, no one can be the best at everything. But, they are clearly the best at thick crust pizza and spumoni!!You can forget about any of those deep dish joints all over the place...this is where they came from and no one can beat it...that's for sure! I love that you can get it either in the dining room, if you have the time and want that kind of experience, or just go to the counter/take out portion where you can get the same quality of food. That's rare in my opinion for something so special. It's Brooklyn Italian at it's best!! Love it...",7/3/2013,0,6,0,w6gOgfdfsuT1CQApeycQ_g

The first time we went, the douchey waiter made sure we knew that their specialty was the square pie even after we ordered a plain ol round pie. How about this? Don't offer round pies if they aren't your specialty and then save the 'tude. After we ate our delicious ROUND pie, we asked for dessert. We ordered a bunch of things including tiramisu. The waiter came back to tell us there was no tiramisu left -- ok, whatever. We will just take spumoni and be happy. Mind you, this first experience there was back in September.Last night, we came there just for dessert because we knew how awesome the ice cream was. We ordered chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu after the waiter TOLD US these were our choices. Ok, he comes back about 5  minutes later to tell us ""There are no more cakes left"". WHAT. EVERY TIME. There are never cakes. Fine, again. We all order ice cream. BUT THEN WAIT FOR IT----THE TABLE ACROSS FROM US ORDERED TIRAMISU AND GOT IT.WHAT.WHY?WHY THE INJUSTICE?Did we forget to use a secret passcode for the tiramisu... was it because we were white people from middle Brooklyn? WHAT WAS IT? Why are we never allowed to eat the tiramisu. Anyway, I was pissed. I wanted to say something, but figured I'd leave a scathing Yelp review instead.

I live in SF Bay area and from time to time I'm trying to explain what's so special about L&B, and even though I can't, I'll give it a shot anyway.It's like half deep dish, and three quarter awesomeness.. It stays crusty while being the juiciest pizza you ever had.. it's salty while it's sweet.. It's sauce perfection and they wouldn't put so much of it if they weren't so confident in it's excellence.. It's something you will never understand till you try it, and then have it at least three more times so your tongue will have enough time to comprehend what just passed by. I hart thin crust more than deep dish but this hybrid throws me in a loop every time I have it. It's too bad that so many people will never know how good pizza can get since both Spumoni Gardens and my all time favorite thin crust (Di Fara) are both in a remote part of Brooklyn and most people wont bother going that far for a slice.

It's basically a run of the mill factory pizzeria with a dozen ovens, just waiting to churn out more pizza. The round slices are the absolute worst thing I have ever eaten. After two slices I was disgusted. The squares are much better but I'm not that impressed. The pizza is not Di Fara or some other great pizza joint from Zagat. Maybe the restaurant part has better food... but if you want to come here to experience top notch pizza, you WILL be disappointed.

2320,Zach L.,0,4,"The sicilian squares did not dissapoint! I was so excited to go here after leaving the Mad Decent Block Party in Coney Island. The setting is really nice, they have a restaurant sit-down area and a large, open, outdoor area with plenty of tables for anyone looking to just grab a couple slices. We ordered a half-tray of their famous squares (12 slices for $20) and each bite was as good as the next. The sauce in itself sets it apart from your average slice of New York pizza, it was what every pizza place should strive for! Then the crunch at the bottom of every slice and at the end with every crust offered the best combination of textures one could ask for! After our pizza we decided to try their homemade italian ices and let me tell you, we did not regret this decision! We ordered a small spumoni ($3) which consisted of chocolate, vanilla and pistachio flavors. Now their homemade italian ices isn't quite like your average cup, this cup of Italian ices is a little more creamy and smooth than the average ices you would get at Ralph's or Rita's.

2325,Gesta F.,0,2,"My friend and I had both been meaning to check this place out for some time. Having been to almost all of NYC's pizza havens, when I saw Adam Richman plugging this supposed gem out in Gravesend, I knew I had to check it out.On arrival, things looked good. There was private parking, outdoor seating, and a crowd of seemingly satisfied customers, many of whom were NYC public employees on their lunch breaks. This was promising, for who would be a better judge of New York's finest...than New York's finest?As we approached the window, a young man placed a piping hot square sicilian pie on the counter before us, precisely the pie about which Richman had boasted so ""Adamantly"" on his heavily syndicated ""Man v. Food.""  So, excitedly my friend and I forked over twelve bucks for four slices and two sodas and took our seats in the shade. To Richman's credit, the slices looked every bit as good as they did on the show, but that's where our praise ends.  The taste was simply unremarkable. Had I not had such high expectations, I would have appreciated it as I would any other average slice; however, this slice was not supposed to be average. The slice's composition was unconventional but a welcomed departure from the norm, at least in appearance.  There was a lot of sauce (which I tend to like) and a crisp, airy crust with a thin layer of mozzarella beneath the sauce and sparse sprinkles of parm' to top it off.  On paper it sounds great, but in execution the flavors simply didn't sing to me.  There was no grand symphony,  nothing exploded in my mouth, and I had no inclination to return for seconds.  To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement, as there was absolutely nothing memorable or even noteworthy about L&B's pizza.This is minor league pizza whose mention does not belong in a conversation about the greats.",9/19/2011,140,13,0,XUVCNJOGLMAkRcyAxHKMYw

My 2 friends and I ordered the half tray from the takeout window and found a great and spacious picnic nearby with the setting sun above us. The sicilians are the way to go here... i mean the Squares. Each tray is assembled with a thick and crisp layer of dough, with provolone cheese and topped with a thick layer of housemade marina sauce and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Our 1/2 tray took all but 10 minutes to come out piping hot, with an airy crispy crust! I usually can put away 2 slices easy... but at L&B, i shamelessly stuffed 3 squares into my belly- it was way past capacity but it was worth the discomfort. Texturally- this slice rocked my world.Flavor-wise: Im calling grandma- i think they stole her sauce!They also serve italian fare: pasta, stromboli, calamari etc, but the wait for a table can be ridic. The price was just right. Since I made such a dent in the 1/2 tray, i bought some individual slices for the suit. 2 squares and a round slice came out to $6.

The english language does not allow to me to properly explain to you quite how intoxicating this pizza is. If you ever find yourself in Brooklyn this is a must go! Walk up to the window on the left hand side and order a slice, you will not be disappointed. Be warned a half a pie is what most pizza places consider a whole (sicilian). As for the restaurant I have no as I can not bring myself to walk past the pizza window to actually get inside.",4/18/2014,26,14,2,CZFE-axxWR75Jfen8JPOxw

2350,Dan Y.,0,2,"Pizza is such a basic thing that it is amazing how so many people get it wrong.  No matter if your a deep dish, thin crust or sicilian slice person, just 3 components, what can go wrong?L&B has got the crust down.  Nice char and cooked thru, no doughy center here.  The sauce everyone raves about really is very good.  They found the perfect balance between sweet and tang.  But the cheese.....wheres the cheese?  I know, I know you put it under the sauce cause it creates some mythical barrier to the sauce and protects the crust from getting soggy.  I'm sorry to report that the flavorless cheese they use and the position in this trio, makes it blend right in with the crust.  What you end up with is this mystery mush between sauce and crust.  Overall it has the texture and taste of under cooked dough.  Call me a purist, but I want my Pizza topped with some hot, stringy, bubbly, slightly charred cheese!  Now doesn't that sound better then mystery mush??",9/29/2011,6,135,5,9BKpOl5GVRAGsMbei2uK-Q
2351,Anthony M.,0,3,I have to admit I was tricked by Man v. Food host Adam Richman into coming here. This place is nothing great. Don't bother. It's way out of the way if you're visiting Manhattan and its not worth the subway ride. Their famous Sicilian squares aren't as great as Adam described. The sauce is way too sweet for me. They clearly add a lot of sugar to their sauce. No San Marzano tomatoes are that sweet. The crust is pretty alright and the cheese is MIA. DO NOT get their spumoni! It's disgusting and inedible. You would think it would be good since it's in their name. NOPE. Pass. No good.,9/19/2011,7,66,14,0jUPEf91Bel13YF8DILj3w

2359,Michael R.,0,1,"People always talk about this ""famous"" Brooklyn place. Every time I ate here in the past the pizza sucked. I ordered dinner from here last night and it took an hour and 20 minutes to get to my house. When he got here the food was ice cold the pizza was soggy bread was soggy on the sandwiches. I ordered a veal Parmesan hero and the meatball Parmesan hero both were stuffed with very little meat (mostly bread and sauce). I ordered a fettucine carbonara which was overcooked, ice cold and all stuck together. I called and told the guy, he said what do you want me to do? You ordered pizza and food? It comes from 2 different areas of our restaurant? I will never order from this place again, they are very lucky they bought a famous spot with a famous name because they are only alive on that.",2/11/2014,50,9,2,pG3tx6XuopVaGU3buhTA9g
2360,Atif I.,1,2,"""The best service I received tonight was from my neighbor!""So said the guy sitting on the table diagonally across mine. After exclaiming repeatedly to having been there for more than three hours, he had developed quite a sympathetic audience of diners. The straw that broke his back was seeing a server walk past him to serve dessert at the table next to his. ""Hey, isn't that mine?"" he challenged the waiter who turned away without responding to him. The beneficiary of the dessert got up, and instead offered it to him. ""Here, take it. No worries."" The gentleman in me hoped that the recipient would at the least thank his benefactor, but perhaps his patience had been stretched beyond limit for all he could do was laugh and mutter, ""Man, It seems I am in the Twilight zone. Nothing is going right, tonight!""He wasn't the only one who had suffered bad service at L&B that night. Upon entering the family owned establishment now in its 69th year of operations, packed with families or teenagers on dates, I was completely ignored by the 8 or so servers roaming around. Even though one managed to elbow me, not a single one stopped and asked me whether I needed a table. When I blocked one of them and asked to be seated, he nodded but disappeared to attend to another table. After standing for 6 minutes or so (having come all the way to Bensonhurst, I was determined to eat and review!!) one of the members of the Barbati family finally came up to inquire whether I was being attended to. So, let me say it in a language the servers can understand: el servicio chupa!Going back to the food, I confess that I am not a fan of Sicilian pizza with its thick French bread like crust. I find it heavier than my preferred pizza option of Neapolitan style pizza, or otherwise the thin crust one. That said, as opposed to the dense, tough concrete bricks of an excuse for Sicilian pizza that you get in other establishments, the square slice here is far superior: a light and crunchy crust, airy middle, coated with minimal mozzarella and THEN topped with a tangy tomato sauce. I would say: Best in class, but in a category that I don't really care much about!As for the famous Spumoni (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio), if it weren't for the ghastly Kelly green, and nuts, I would've had a hard time figuring out that the flavor was indeed Pistachio! And, chocolate, really?! That was chocolate?! Conceptually, I would think that Spumoni, predecessor to the Neapolitan ice cram is a wonderful dessert: molded Italian ice cream with layers of different flavors and colors and a fruit and nut layer to add texture and complexity. However, it would appear that the Spumoni at L&B still avails the same food coloring, and essences, that the founder Ludovico Barbati used in 1939! 12 slices of pizza, a Spumoni, and bottled water left me with a bill of $26.40. As the waiter (who had earlier expected me to butter the complimentary bread with my fork, and not knife) came back to collect the cash he inquired whether I needed any change back from my $40. I made sure that he saw the bill, before commenting that even he couldn't possibly expect that the service merited a 50% tip. Or, indeed a return trip...",10/19/2008,178,642,1789,cD_hpkvErXCyQHBQzv8KYQ

2362,Bloss C.,1,4,"Ok, so I made it my mission in life to finally get out there to try the famous square pie.  I like that you can buy full pies or half pies.  The pizza was really good.  Good sauce, good crust, good all around.  There is always a line here and the staff kind of has an attitude of heightened self-importance, so minus 1 star.  I also had their Spumoni gelato, which I was a little disappointed in.  I've had better at Ferrara's in Little Italy or even De Robertis Pasticceria in the East Village.  Overall good place, I would definitely stop by if I was in the area, but I'm not sure it's worth a trip out there just to get their pizza.",5/16/2012,779,1101,2616,qs4kM3kgCixzNBP_4sAhVg
2363,Phil L.,0,2,"Wow this place is highly rated?  I'm not sure exactly what all the hoopla is about this place, and maybe I'm not a New Yorker but I sure as hell do know how I like my pizza.  This is not that place.  So Sicilian pies are their thing here.  We ordered a plain cheese pizza and fried calamari.  Not really sure what the cost was for everything but it was $7 bucks per person which is pretty damn good.  But if you're looking for a good pizza, I would go elsewhere nor would I make a journey out here to grab a slice.  Their Sicilian pizza was very thick, with cheese on the bottom, sauce over the top, and that's it.  If you like wonder bread, you'd probably love their crust because that's what it reminded me of.  Way to doughy for my liking and missing that chewy characteristic I love so much.  The other edge of the crust was nice and crispy but everything else was just soft bread, not good.  The sauce was good, and I swear the put the sauce on top to cover up the fact they don't put any cheese on the pizza.  I honestly couldn't tell on two of my slices if there was any cheese on it and that's out of the 3 that I ate.  I understand a real Italian pizza is light on the cheese, but shoot, I should have some cheese on every slice.  Everything was fine though once doctored up with every condiment imaginable, hot pepper flakes, garlic seasoning, oregano, oh and of course parmesan cheese to make up for their lack of cheese.Sorry Spumoni, I've had better Sicilian pizzas at a number of places.",10/10/2011,167,876,249,7eFy-LxZuvS2K6PAQoibBA
2364,An-Chun L.,0,1,"This rating is solely based on their customer service. I wanted to have my last pizza for the year of 2013 here or possibly not have pizza for a while until I get in shape versus going to Staten Island for real Italian food.When my sister lived in the area and whenever I would visit her as a kid, she would take me to L&B almost all the time. I love their ice cream and pizza but ever since HS, I barely remember their food and hospitality now. It is a distant memory. Since I decided to see my sister tomorrow in Staten Island, I figure I take a trip all the way to L&B from East Brooklyn for New Year's Eve. Big mistake!!! I got there fairly before sunset too. The whole place seems to be 3 total separate entities now apparently, even though it's a whole family owned business. They WERE open, accordingly to the restaurant and ice cream side. I wanted to have a slice of their Silician style pizza. I just only wanted ONE slice. I forgot to mention I came miles for this pizza.  So the restaurant guy tells me if I wanted a slice, I jad to go outside all the way to the left. I was like WTF? So I asked the ice cream guy and he said the same. Ok so I went and that part of their camp was closed, cleaning up for the night. That guy had me waiting a whole minute in the cold too to tell me, ""Sorry, we have no more pizza"". They could have suggested to me to buy a whole pie on the restuarant side but they didn't and I didn't want to waste my time further on these ppl. It didn't make any sense to me whatsoever if they were open or not.I don't think this is how they acted with me when I was younger. Who knows if their food has changed too. They seem heartless over this New Year's Holiday. So don't come here if you don't want to be treated this way. They don't even put signs up, like every other business if they are closing early for this holiday evening! Don't even bother calling them about their holiday hours if this is how they areFrank's Pizza on Flatbush Ave and Ave P in Brooklyn is much better on these terms.

2367,Kathleen M.,1,5,"When Famous Fat Dave introduced us to this place on our last visit to New York, it was so good we took the subway out on our own from Manhattan (a one hour ride) only 12 hours later. This time we were staying with a friend in New Jersey so we endured a 2 hour train and subway trip from New Jersey involving FOUR TRANSFERS just to eat here. Totally worth it though. My time is precious in New York because I never have enough time to go everywhere I want to, but it's worth traveling for the pizza at Spumoni Gardens.What they do here is Sicilian style pizza which is thicker and breadier than New York style. You order at the counter and let them know how many crust edges you want. The pizza slices are all square shaped and the pie is cooked as one big rectangle, so your choices are 0, 1, and 2. (I prefer 1 - like back hair it gives you something to hold onto.) I recommend ordering one slice at a time so it never gets cold. Oh yeah, they make one kind of pizza and it's cheese. That's the only kind you need. The sauce is what makes it good. In fact it's outstanding.You'll probably get a table but you may have to wait a few minutes. Soft drink cans are $1.50 each which is a bit on the high side.When you're done you can head next door where there's a sit down restaurant (serving pasta classics) and spumoni counter. While you wait you can look at the old neighborhood pictures.The spumoni is a day-glo green color, and it's nutty and it's the best damn spumoni I've ever had.Blue collar New York and Boston guys are smart and will mess with you. It's something we unfortunately don't have in the same way on the West Coast. When I got my spumonis I asked for a spoon, and the counter guy was like ""That'll be $1."" I was like Ha ha, smart ass.This place is a slightly sketch walk from the subway. It's fine during the day but I wouldn't do it at night. You also get to walk past an Aardvark amusement rental place with small amusement park rides. (Can you tell Coney Island is only a mile away?)

I then normally get a half sheet to bring home with me to eat for the rest of the week. I've actually never dined at the indoor sit-down portion of the restaurant.

2391,Amy H.,0,4,"I had very high expectations for this place because theyve been open for seventy years and seem to be very popular. for the most part, they delivered. I got the garlic bread as an appetizer and though im not typically a bread person, im glad i ordered it. it was perfectly cooked and the garlic was applied very generously. There were even charred chunks of garlic on top which provided a nice effect. My main course was the red clam sauce and spaghetti. The sauce disappointed me a bit because it wasnt as flavorful as i was expecting (had to add a bunch of red pepper to get it to taste close to how i wanted it). However, the clams were amazing-plump and extremely fresh tasting. My boyfriend got the seafood fra diavolo which should be a spicy sauce but the flavor seemed lacking in his sauce as well and it seemed a bit thin. He also agreed that the seafood itself was very good though so the theme here seems to be understated sauces and great seafood. The dessert was the best part of the meal-we went for the spumoni since we figured that the restaurant's namesake should be pretty good. It was the best spumoni ive ever had in my life!One of the best parts about this restaurant is that its very reasonably priced, especially for new york. Our bill was just under 60 dollars for the two of us even though we ordered appetizers and desserts. Keep in mind that the hours on the restaurant's website arent completely accurate. The dining room closes at 11:30, not midnight  though the pizza area is open later. Found this out the hard way after i attempted to go the first time and walked for an hour only to get no food.

No but I'm a spoiled New Yorker and never wait more than 15 mins. There is always another place to eat.

I had a chicken marsal hero today, there should not be onions involved. I don't like having to de-turd my food, ever. The chicken was over cooked and the hero was not well put together. The service is lack luster. sat with no menus, eventually got menus, but the waiter seemed to be in a rush and didn't really care about our order much. Then they decide to put two tables together behind us, right where my special needs son's stroller is, so some fat lady is now trying to push him under the table and constantly smacking into his feeding pump. With my own years of waiter service and bartender service, this becomes a personal pet peeve, when a glass is half way empty, you refill it or ask if we'd like a refill. I should not have to chase you down to get a refill. And I dislike tourists a lot, regardless of what state I'm in. We had to wait 20 minutes to get sat because of some lame brooklyn bus tour, these 50+ people came in, barely had a slice n a beer and left, but took over the entire patio section. I know a big party gets to be first priority b/c you're hoping for the big payout, but I'd like to see some old skool spots become anti large tourist group. Cater to the locals instead. I still don't see why this place is in the top 10 pizza places, and these days, it seems most people have no idea what a good slice really is, take your papa johns/dominoes/pizza hut crap and get out of my state!!!!!!",11/30/2013,65,64,4,e_WMDeQlMQL2eGWuZOwphw
2408,Mike C.,0,1,"This rating is solely on their Sicilian square pizza.  The pizza is made with the sauce on top of the cheese.  I ordered a 12 slice pie and the first thing that stood out was the doughy texture. I suspect the dough was not fully baked so it was gooey and sad tasting.  The cheese was minimal and tasteless, while the sauce was there to make the pizza look good but lacked flavor as well.  It reminded me a lot of a microwavable pizza I use to have when I was a kid.  As a pizza lover, it pains me to have such an experience and give this rating.",4/7/2016,0,27,0,9ceSdVniH4kk4huX2r14ew

The bottom was crisp and the middle was doughy. The pepperoni was the same way. The only thing that was bad about it was the burnt pepperoni.  My mind wasn't blown away, but it was good for what it was worth.

But while my dish looked good, I didn't care for it.  The mussels and clams could have been fresher and the shrimp was overcooked.  Kind of made me think I should have stuck to the pizza....I looked across the room and a busload of senior citizens from New Jersey had filled up a party room.  They ordered ten orders of sicilian pies.  Oh, they looked so good.  I stared at them enviously for a few minutes and then looked back at my own plate.  Next time I'm going back for the Sicilian.",4/29/2010,68,91,45,no1Eg9lva-cgTTVX4s46dA

Their pizza is great and the service is fast.  The Only problem I do have is that the tables are always sticky.  The Eat in Restaurant is a bit nicer but it was a nice day and we decided to sit in the outdoor area.  The food portions were huge and most of us had to bag it up to go.  But overall it was a nice experience and good food in the indoor restaurant as well.",3/17/2009,784,674,1324,YYLDPgetN_4NoPW_tWlkYg

Really nothing that you couldn't get at any of the other 10000 pizza spots in NYC. We then went inside for dinner when the rest of our party showed up.

As a matter of fact, it's unlike any other Sicilian pizza that I have had.  Definitely worth the trip.To make a long story long........I go to Brooklyn every year on Easter to get the Grain Pie and Canoli from Villabate. I also go to Joe's of Avenue U every so often.  I heard Joe's has a spot in Staten Island now.  I haven't tried that location yet, but the Pasta chi Rizzi, Pasta chi Niuru and Panelle at the location in Brooklyn are some of my favorites.  Real Sicilian specialties.  Simple but great.  Love that stuff.  I also used to go to the feast of Santa Rosalia with my friends when we were younger.  Those were good times, but of all the times that I have been to Brooklyn, I never tried L&B's.  My fiancé and I had planned a trip to Aruba, and our flight was early on a Saturday morning.  We didn't want to make my brother wake up early and drive us to the airport.  So, we booked a hotel room and had him drive us to the hotel the night before.  The payoff?  Pizza at L&B's.  Like I said before, it was worth the trip to Brooklyn.  It may have been worth a trip to Aruba!  It could be a little intimidating to order a slice there.  Things were crazy when I went, but I like it crazy.  I got 2 squares and a soda.  Next time I'm getting 4.  Yes......4.  Great place in the summer.  Get your pizza.  Grab a table outside.  Take down a few squares.  Then go next door and order yourself a Spumoni.  Great Spumoni too.",8/12/2014,4,11,0,g8epTEPG-vk6meM_38KdVw

From that transaction, it all went downhill. The squares used to be gigantic and loaded with tasty sauce. Now, they're half the size and DRY. WTF happened to the sauce? Horrible. My wife is not Italian and SHE noticed the difference. In fact, SHE noticed it first! I gave Spumoni the benefit of the doubt and tried 3 more times. Each time was the same. Lousy. It's not what it used to be and now it's just a popularity contest. I believe most reviewers here that gave them 4- 5 stars are either their first time or they're regulars fooling themselves and are trying desperately hard to accept the changes.

It's become our tradition to come here when we're going to Coney Island - and we usually order the same thing: Eggplant Parmigiana, and pasta with vodka sauce. The eggplant comes over penne, with delicious sauce and tons of cheese. The vodka sauce is a thick, creamy orange sauce with fresh mushrooms and green peas. And the portions are each enough to feed 3 people. I kid you not. You cannot finish one of the dishes here alone. I also got the blush wine, which is a sweet, girly wine - and I like it.Don't forget to save room for the spumoni! There's a reason it's in the name of the establishment!

It was cooked on the bottom and sides but under the sauce and cheese RAW and I do mean raw. We got half a pie which is about12 slices. Everyone in our group of 6 agreed.  They put their cheese on top of the dough to supposedly prevent doughynes but fagetaboutit  its raw raw raw under the cheese. My son said I make better at home and I agreed. The trick is you bake your crust for 5 mins in a hot oven first before putting anything on it.Now if grandma was in the kitchen or somekinda italian owners maybe they would do  some quality control for the perfect slice.By the way I am Italian and ate at grandmas every Sunday on 118th street when i was growing up so I do know good Italian food.

I wish we had been there earlier because by 9:45 they had run out of lasagne. Bummer.  My son and I had to choose again. They made up for it by coming us a spectacular looking and tasting Spumoni. They said it was to welcome us back after a long absence. They can be sure we will be back there much sooner after this.,1/18/2012,2,75,79,AF8NE2L1XKmEQshIUCJ_FA
2446,C P.,0,1,"If you plan on ordering delivery from l&b you better have a back up plan. First, it will take a MINIMUM of an hour and a half to be delivered. They will tell you 45 minutes when you order but it never actually comes. When the food does finally arrive at its destination it will be cold. Lastly you will have to be prepared to eat whatever it is they felt like sending. Ordered on salad? Surprise, didn't have the ingredients so they sent a different salad. At least it's in the same realm of what you originally ordered. Other surprises have included ordered raviolis parmigiana, received raviolis covered in parmigiana cheese. Ordered rice ball special, received plate of grilled chicken. My personal favorite: ordered fried zucchini, received baked clams. Called to request they send back the correct order and the guy argued that they don't have clams and I must be mistaken.  Are you kidding me? When you call to ask where the food that you have waited an hour and a half for is, or to request that the correct food be sent, the attitude is well what do you want me to do about it? There is no apology or compensation and if your naive enough to ask them to resend your order you will wait another hour and a half. You would think these issues would be solely on the delivery portion, but the same issues arise in the restaurant. I ordered raviolis parmigiana and received a plate of raviolis covered with cheese but NO SAUCE. the waiter told me the cooks did not understand what I was asking for.Overall, I'm done. Yes, the pizza is good and the rest of their menu is decent but I'm sick and tired of what ends up on my plate taking two hours, being cold and having to win the lottery to receive what I actually ordered. There's plenty of other great pizza places in the area, l&b is just resting on their reputation without the follow thru to back it up.",12/8/2013,92,4,2,_5slsyRNoWtjd9cspxJFHA

Of course it isn't complete unless you also get some spumoni next door, which is the perfect complement to the pizza. The spumoni is a mixture of three flavors - pistachio, chocolate, and canilla. My girlfriend and I, always argue over which is the best flavor. I went to the restaurant part one time, and got the chef's table, a four-course family style meal.

2460,Diana S.,0,4,"Their Sicilian pizza should be illegal because it's crack. You can't just eat one. Seriously. I dare you.The first time I came here was on our way to Brighton beach. We had a few slices and picked up a tray to go for the rest of our friends already at the beach. Most recently, I came after running a 5K at Coney Island with the Wildlife Conservation Society to save turtles! After the run, they had the usual bananas, yogurt, apples and grapes, but we wanted something more to celebrate our run. L&B doesn't open until 11am on Sundays so we had to kill some time at the Aquarium (the Sea Lion show is amazing!). We left around 10:30 and took the orange line two stops to Avenue X. Although the yellow line station is a lot closer to L&B so I recommend you take that instead. It was approximately a 10min walk from the orange line station. We each got a slice of the Sicilian, but had to get seconds because it's so derish. I prefer the corner slice and middle slice combo when ordering. The crust is so crunchy and reminds me of the edges of lasagna and the center pieces are so soft and saucy. Absolutely amazing combination.After our meal, we split a Rainbow spumoni (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio). It was pretty good but not as amazing as the pizza. Some bites tasted a little too artificial and a good portion of it was icy and not as creamy (kinda like when you leave ice cream in the freezer for too long!). I wouldn't get it again if I went back, but probably would try some of their ice cream instead.",10/10/2011,290,448,282,3pTkcBjNAiPFLIbyprPKgQ

2468,Arthur B.,0,5,"One of THE HANDS DOWN best takes on a Square Sicilian Slice you'll find on the PLANET. Sometimes you drive by and decide you want just one slice. But you walk up to the window a great ol tray of pizza and before you know it you're sitting at one of their benches, the sun shining on your face, and you've got 3 big hot slices covered in sauce and parmesean staring you in the stomach. Then you get up to waddle to your car in their parking lot, which is almost always full but at least they have one, and out of the corner of your eye you see a small child with the biggest grin on their face. You turn around and they are OM NOM NOMing some Strawberry Spumoni. Well now that did it and the next thing you know you've got a cone of creamy goodness in one hand and a pre-packed quart in the other. If that wasn't enough they have a full service Italian restaurant with indoor and outside seating. Oh yes. I'm not kidding.

Thought we were lost after getting off the train, but after walking through some questionable areas, we made it in one piece to L&B.Then, there was some confusion about how to order, since there's 3 different areas. There's an indoor, sit-down restaurant, where we actually went in, sat down, drank a sip of water, before realizing this was probably not what we were looking for. I'm sure the waiters were not amused when we got up and left....Then, we dilly dallied in the middle part for a good 5 minutes, where there's a counter for take out, where we scoured the menu looking for the pizza and spumoni...before some kind soul took pity on us and told us we probably wanted to go outside.Finally. Outside at the most left window we ordered our (whole entire square pizza with pepperoni for 2 little girls), and waited for it.It was delicious! With plenty of leftovers I was eating pizza for days, and trust me I was not complaining. Then, we went to the 2nd window and got us some dessert. BTW don't get all Pistachio you'll regret it. But the Lemon Ice was very refreshing.I think L&B is the ideal place if it's nice day and you have a big group of hungry teenagers to feed..or even a nice casual/fun date spot.

Thick, and somehow creamy almost, it melts in your mouth! The cheese is a perfect consistency with the sauce they just slide right into your mouth! Best part is you can sit outside and eat your pizza then walk up to the window and have a Spumoni ice for dessert! The Spumoni is out of this world and I have yet to have any that come close to it...it is creamy and light, not to sweet, but just right. Stop in and ask for a ""square"" slice, a corner is my recommendation (if you like extra crust).

L&B does have a small parking lot for customers but I notice a lot of people stay in their cars all night! They become ""squatters"" in L&B's parking lot. This isn't a drive through! Get your pizza and hit the road!!!  As a result, people like myself who are there to do just that become the victims of pissed off delivery boys who've HAD IT with the lack of spots in the lot. One evening I had a craving for L&B's pizza. I found a spot in the lot and ran in. When I come back to my car I find that some asshole blocked me in and it is impossible for me to pull out my car and go home! One of the workers in the back informed me that the car belonged to one of the pizzeria's drivers. I asked if he can kindly tell the inconsiderate piece of shit to move his car. Well I waited and waited .  Then I went inside L&B's and asked again. Then I was told it will be moved. As I made my way back... The dickless wonder drove off. My pizza was nice and cold.

The food has always been delicious and the service good. However this was not the case during my most recent visit. First off they changed their sauce recipe and it's horrible, you can still taste the metal from the cans, I didn't even want to dip my zucchini sticks into it. Second off they have the audacity to bring out a grilled shrimp salad, which consist of iceberg lettuce and a under ripped tomato. It honestly looked like a salads you make when you have no ingredients in your house. The shrimp were not bad but when the bill came and the salad was 23$ we honestly thought our waiter over charged us by a mistake. This young waiter came over, who has been there for a long time (I've seen him before)and he was so rude when we asked about the price, we thought it was a mistake considering it was literally iceberg lettuce an underripe tomato and some chopped radishes. He had the audacity to say ""well...that's what a ""salad"" is.""  As if I needed a lesson on what a salad consists of! I proceeded to thank him for the ""lesson"" on salad (mind you he was young enough to be my son). how's that for rude and disrespectful.

2524,Freddie F.,0,3,"This was my third trip to L&B Spumoni Gardens. In 2008, FEEP (fellow enthusiast for eating pizza) Jr. and I did an outer boro pizza tour. We made a stop at Spumoni Gardens for a slice of their square pie and a conventional triangle slice from the round pie.  About a year ago, I returned with EPBAC (eats pizza but avoids cheese) and again sampled both the square pie and a conventional triangle slice. Based on those two experiences, I safely concluded that the round pie was forgettable. The square didn't blow me away either, but based on the reviews of pizza bloggers more expert than I, it was an easy decision on a hot August afternoon to stop in and try again en route from Dyker Heights to JFK.Here is some background, excerpted from their website: ""Here we are known for our Famous Sicilian Pizza, Home made Spumoni, and outside seating. Ludovico Barbati came into the United States back in 1917, from Torella Di Lombardi, Italy. In 1938 Ludovico learned from a baker how to make Spumoni and Ices, in a little garage on West 8th Street, Brooklyn New York. He sold his products up and down the streets of Gravesend & Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. In 1939, Ludovico, Sr. decided he needed a little, inexpensive place to make the Spumoni and Ices, so he purchased vacant property on 86th street in Brooklyn. In the mid 1950's L & B Spumoni Gardens built the second building, which is now the Pizzeria, selling our famous thick Sicilian pies, as well as our regular round pies. L & B Spumoni Gardens is now in its fourth generation. There will always be a family member to greet you at our doors.""Nice stuff! Let me translate that last sentence: ""There will always be a family member to bark at you if you hesitate when you order.""  That is not a complaint! In fact, the brusque attytood of the window staff is part of L&B's charm. The place is huge by pizza joint standards. There is a separate window to order pizza and a window for spumoni and Italian ices.I ordered two square slices, and I was happy that I did not get a center sans-cornicione piece. I got one standard border slice that had a single crusty edge, and a corner piece with two crispy edges. Upon visual inspection, it is abundantly clear that this is not pizza, deep-dish pizza, or Sicilian pizza. Yes, it has a thick Sicilian-style crust, but the cheese is a mere dusting of some aged finely grated cheese, probably Parmesan. This, folks, is what we call tomato pie in Conshohocken PA (and at Wegman's market).For a cheeseless pie, the sauce should shine. This sauce was nice, but it gets smoked by the sauce at Marzano's in Exton PA, where the sauces sits atop the cheese in the uniquely Pennsylvanian ""upside down pizza"" style. In fact, this sauce was no better than the thick rich red gravy that sits on the five buck tomato pie from Wegman's. Those who praise the L&B square pie talk most about the crust. Crisp, airy, crunchy. It was all that. Starting with its perfectly browned bottom, above that is a layer that is puffy like good Italian bread, then above that is a layer that is dense and moist (probably from the sauce). Texture-wise, this is pretty good. Better than the light airy crust at Marzano's, and with a tad more flavor than the Wegman's tomato pie.I have to conclude about this square pie what I've concluded about tomato pie in general: if you grew up eating it, it must be pretty special. If you discover it as an adult, it's a fine snack but at the end of the day it's a pretty good pizza with the cheese missing. I'm glad that there are places like this, but I think the whole look and feel -- window ordering, outdoor seating, spumoni for dessert -- makes this place more an experience than an epicurean event (same can be said for Pat's or Geno's Cheesesteaks on Passyunk Avenue in Philly). You go for the ambiance, not so much for the food.I love ice cream, I like spumoni but there are a lot of places selling some crappy stuff they call gelati or spumoni but which aren't as good as supermarket ice cream. I'm happy to report that the spumoni at L&B was wonderful. I loved their take on ""Neapolitan"" in which they substitute pistachio for strawberry. And they scoop it from three different drums!  The vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio products were the perfect soft texture (though they began to melt faster than I could eat & photograph). The small cup of spumoni was the same price as a square slice: $2.25. Nice value.How does it all stack up?  Based on my two past experiences, I rate the round pie a 5. Not bad, but not distinctive in any way. The square pie rates higher. I think I can go up to 7. The spumoni is a 9.5!  Loved it. This is a fine institution and I encourage you to stop by if you are in the area OR if you are a big fan of tomato pie. But for me, it's not destination pizza.I am Pizza Quixote!",8/7/2011,8,39,13,fvlpdmIOs_1y7FVw_-jPCA

2531,Michael U.,0,2,"Continuing along our previously determined route - 2 persons per car - our next stop would be one of the oldest in Brooklyn - L&B Spumoni Gardens.  Having heard of this space from some local friends in the past but having never seen it mentioned on a ""best of"" list (actually, most of what I'd heard was quite negative aside from two glowing recommendations of the namesake Spumoni) I went into the experience with modest expectations - expectations seemingly warranted by the rather unkempt clientele (think track suits and fake-gold chains) and gaudy exterior (think  neon lights).....plus Steve 1's statement that he wanted to bring us here as a ""contrast"" to DiFara's - and that he wasn't going to order any pizza.More a full-fledged eatery than DiFara's or the other spaces on our trip, the first thing I noted when entering the non-pizza half of L&B was the smell - it wasn't ""bad"" but it reminded me of the ketchup factory near where I grew up - not a good sign since I saw spaghetti sauce and not a Heinz bottle.  Following Steve 1's lead and first ordering a small spumoni for a little over $2 I have to admit that although I'm pretty sure there was nothing artisan about the ingredients or organic about the colors this was some tasty ice cream - a bit more icy than creamy but absolutely loaded with faux-pistachio flavor, buttery almond/vanilla, and Hershey's kisses tasting chocolate.Making our way next door where Steve 2 and Laura had already taken a seat I was greeted by a burly smiling fellow serving up slices and when I ordered a single slice he gifted me a second for free as there were only two left in the pan - a nice gesture, even if it would turn out to be wasted.  Taking a seat and subsequently a bite I instantly noted the previously ""contrast"" - this square slice was pretty terrible.  With a doughy crust not terribly different from the frozen sort you'd expect from Costco topped with a sort of briny and bland sauce and grated parmesan plus what was undoubtedly bagged mozzarella (perhaps from Costco?)  the only fair comparison I can make is to the square slices served up at Little Caesars in Joe Louis Arena when I was a child...a pizza I never really liked, but a pizza I always finished due to the excessive arena price and a pizza I'll always remember due to the location.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?) for L&B the price was bargain basement so I had no trouble placing the second slice in the trash before leaving the memorable (for better or worse?) location.",4/4/2011,3127,4510,103926,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA

Aside from that debacle, the food was very bland and nothing special. I've had SO much better italian food in Brooklyn - I would not recommend this place. For example -Patrizias in Williamsburg and Il Porto in Fort Greene blow this place out of the water. Also, the interior seems like it hasn't been thoroughly cleaned since the place opened and is very outdated. I also feel nauseous after eating. BLEH.

Not sure but it was damn good!  We took the leftovers from that bad-boy home.  I'll have to fight for them for a future lunch I'm sure.  Because yours truly was so psyched about the Square pie, we took home a 12 slice pie as well.  We drove about 45 minutes so I figured this justified my gluttony! LOL.  I'll freeze it for a rainy day, no?You walk up to order on a separate line for pies, 12 slice Square or 24 Slice  Square, round pies.  There always seems to be 20 or so 12 slice Square pies, ready to go.  We waited like a minute, maybe for our Square pie.  Awesome-ness!!! They announced  when our round pie with sausage was ready over a LOUDspeaker.  It cracked us up!! There is no shame in the game here and most people were walking out with at least a 12 slice Square box, either to a table or to their double-parked, in heavy traffic no less! , car!  Fun people watching, truly everyone and their mother!!! Kids, couples, grannies, a few people that could be extras in the Sopranos, Im just sayin!!! lolIt would be a sin to leave without trying the Spumoni, so I did!!

2535,George C.,0,5,"L&B left me spewing superlatives, as it's simultaneously:The pinnacle of pizza pies (even if their regular isn't as lauded)The mountain of mozzarella (even if it's heavier on sauce than cheese)The climax of crust (its airyness may even incite such a reaction, though it can get aesthetically meh)The tiptop of tomato-y goodness (with subtle yet distinct flavor)The summit of the square slice (even if it's sometimes a slight rectangular, geometrically speaking)So many places forget how many regulars you keep by not hiking your prices due to popularity.

The Sicilian slice was enjoyed immensely al fresco, 'cause there's no other way to (respectably) do it at Spumoni Gardens*, where the plentiful seating is filled by loyal patrons and gushing virgins. It's different in appearance than your usual suspect, and far more delicious to boot. It's a beautiful thing, a testament to the excellence of the slice, really, that you want to scarf it down and savor it simultaneously.I also opted for the eponymous icy treat (sans greenery) from an adjacent window, another meager $2.25 for heaven. Fortunately, I had the foresight to check and realize the rainbow spumoni here is a trio of vanilla, chocolate, & PISTACHIO (BAZINGA), so I went with a small cup on my way out. This badboy was studded with endearing chunks of ice and a peculiar but not unwelcome hint of coffee, a pleasantly pistachio-heavy icy treat.*Though, according to a posted sign, the only way to gain access to the restrooms is to be a paying dining room customers. If you weren't a dining room patron yet dropped excessive dough outside and hafta use the restroom, take your business elsewhere...though I quasi-understand the rationale, the fact that this kinda person is outta luck is my only real qualm about L&B.",8/12/2011,0,7747,14304,8RcEwGrFIgkt9WQ35E6SnQ

Since we specifically came for the pizza we figured we should turn around and order outside.

When we were seated we didn't get service for a bit but once they realized they were excellent! We ended up ordering a couple appetizers, which were goood. But the pizza was amazzzinnggg! We got the sicilian. Sauce was bangin, and it was doughy :) Then for dessert I told the waiter that I had never been there before and wasn't sure what to order. They hooked up the craziest dessert ever. 2 choc. ice cones and what I assume is their signature dessert. Amazing... and when we got the bill it was free!!! Can't beat that!!!

So, yeah, the pizza was ice cold.

2545,Edward C.,0,4,"One of the few iconic places of Brooklyn, while sometimes i question their overall quality as being the best in Brooklyn in terms of pizza (just way too many contenders in that category) they un-doubtably have one of the best VALUES when it comes to their Sicilian pie despite their ratings and reputation. The service is as you can expect for a pizza joint, fast to the point, no bullshit and absolute no time wasting. They will give you some recommendations if you're first time there but i suggest you to do your own research on what you want before lining up as its definitely an inconvenience to others. As for the food, their Sicilian is probably the best Sicilian pie in Brooklyn, being the first to create a cheese first then sauce on top style of pizza, it taste absolutely fantastic. From the crust (which i suspect they did something to) to the heavy sauce that symbolizes Sicilian cuisine to the great spumoni desert you can order right afterwards to the pricing which allows access to their great food no matter what income class you are.

Even though it has been a few years since I have had a Sicilian slice from L&B, as soon as I saw the picture I experience euphoric recall. I immediately tasted the sweet sauce, gooey cheese, soft upper crust and deliciously burnt bottom crust. It brought back memories of Sheeps Head bay, Bay Ridge, and Coney island; growing up in the 90's, having L&B on the weekends with my family. I can't even begin to convey the kind of emotional response just seeing a picture of this pizza brought back. It is that good.

The Sicilian Pizza is without equal, the only pie I place on Par with this is Di Fara, and we all know that is the upper echelon. I have never had bad food here, on the contrary my experiences here have been nearly transcendent.

The structure of the pie is (take notes, those of you who seem to think there's no cheese on the pie): dough, mozzarella, sauce, grated Parmesan...in that order.I don't know what goes in that sauce, but it is good enough to eat alone with a spoon. Its savory, tangy, sweet and garlicky all in one. Simply amazing.  The soft doughy middle of a slice is usually juxtaposed by a crunchy charred crust...again, amazing. This is not your average square, its a flavor explosion.Lucky for me, I'm within the delivery zone, but I'd still come here even if I lived in the depths of Queens.",5/23/2011,0,19,0,H218pkdXR5H-drftfY_tzw

I parked, went inside, ordered half a box of Sicilian, got the box instantly (it was still steaming hot), and got back into the car within five minutes. I kid you not! The Sicilian half pie has 12 slices - that is enough to feed about 6 people, more or less depending how hungry you are. I ate 3 slices =). The crust was thick and crunchy. There was a thin layer of cheese and the sauce was full-bodied and amazing. There were a bunch of italian spices and it had a fresh tomato flavor. The peculiar thing about Spumoni is that they put their pizza sauce on top of the cheese. The only downfall of the pie was that the immediate layers beneath the cheese were getting pretty soggy, because they box the pie right after they make it. But, the thick crust prevented that from being a huge issue. Nice, satisfying pizza!",2/21/2011,200,324,213,8npjvb0y_9j8Yy26B_3xew

FYI: I've come up with the perfect method to reheating pizza. You take the pizza slice and you place it in the microwave for a minute or so untill the cheese melts. (I know you guys think mircrowaving pizza is gross but i'm not finished yet) Then you take the slice and place it on a heated fry pan. It makes the crust all nice and cripsy. This method is better than a conventional oven because 1. its a lot quicker and 2. the sauce is not all completely dried up.

At this point its probably obvious that this is one of our favorite places.The square pizza has the sauce on top, which gives it a great look, and encourages a rare practice among pizza places: USING ENOUGH SAUCE!!  Pizza is about sauce, and the Barbotti family recipe is top-notch. Advice: 1- Order the square slices. Round is not an option here. 2- Be prepared for a wait if you go in the summer, because it gets crowded (including a fairly regular crowd double-parked police officers).3- Order multiple slices, you will want more and won't want to get back in line.4-  Have the Spumoni --- many other pizza places order their spumoni from L&B; that is not an accident, it is wonderful.Bottom line: I love L&B.

Mostly was a pungent taste of tomato sauce and heavy amount of thick dough. There is only chardonnay wine in the restaurant. I am a wine drinker with food. My tongue is more a gourmet taste I guess. I am very selective and strict when it comes to tasting quality. I have tasted far and beyond better italian pizzas in other boroughs. I could not even finish the square single slice. The taste was very strong for me. I had to get home to drink a Sauvignon Blanc to rinse off the taste. The fried calamari tasted like any other local pizzerias and the salads, no wow factor. Definitely not coming back and not recommending my foodie friends, who know quality tasting. Believe me, I never look for 5 star restaurants. The most important thing is that food must be done right and have an epic taste to come back. Apologies for this true opinion.",8/11/2016,0,2,0,U1HRcFj3zcN1pqER7HUqQA

Anyways there's the outside take out area...or the inside restaurant , where we decided to eatOf course, we both started off with a slice of sicilian grandma pizza as an appetizer.  I like it, don't say I love loved it.  Its kinda doughey....but the sauce is really amazing! So tasty.I ordered the sicilian eggplant! OH MY YUM!! Its just delicious and simple, layered with penne and cheese, and sauce, but the real kinda penne! Old school!The service was great and overall the food was great...but was so amazing beyond that is that the owner of the place, Lenny, comes up to us and talks to us and tells about the tasting menu...I tell him its my first time there....he brings out T shirts for us.....he orders us dessert on the house! And when dessert comes...OMG fuggehdaboutit!!! Its this huge tartufo ice cream creation with whip cream and fudge sauce...wow...I was stuffed but it was so good I couldn't stop!!!  And then he gives us to take home some shrimp cocktail and a boston salad.....before we leave he talks to us again, gives me a card and asks me to call to put my name down if we want to come again.This place was just special.  I could feel it.  Thanks Lenny!!

If you're into a lot of sauce and dough, then their Sicilian slice is for you. I happen to like my pizza with more cheese. This is a nice place for people to try at least once just for the experience. But once you've had it, it's not really worth coming back.

2606,Joe J.,0,4,"Unique among pizzas in Brooklyn.  The most obvious difference is how doughy and thick its crust is.  High quality mozzarella sits under the sauce and melts into the crust which gives it an extra doughy consistency.  They're generous with their sauce which is sweet and more viscous than most other pizzas.  While this isn't your typical NY style pizza, it's reliably delicious.",12/31/2013,131,19,3,29nbsE9v76ezOquCllD32A

2608,C C.,0,4,"Having grown up in Bensonhurst Spumoni Gardens is pretty much a standby. Having lived in Brooklyn most of my life I can tell you there are better places for pizza and sandwiches. The good: Large portion sizes- please share your portions or consider your daily calorie intake met with one mealThe food is freshGreat customer service- very down to earth (they will call out a fake name over the speaker to get your food w/o hesitating just like Mo's Tavern from the Simpsons- everyone LOL's and keeps eating)Fantastic desserts - yes they are served in a paper cup but they will put whatever you ""need"" in there and it will be good! You want the pistachio ice cream and the spumoni. The atmosphere is fun- last time I was there a crew on motorcycles was getting their pizza and it was entertaining. Sometimes I head over there just to feel my Brooklyn roots aka where no one says I have an accent. You should expect a crowd esp in the summer after people have been hanging out at Coney Island. You should not be surprised if you have to share a table with strangers- everyone just wants to eat :) You can pick out the tourists easily- they stare wide-eyed like they are in a zoo watching Brooklynites in their natural habitat.Could be improved on - more flavor in the sauces for all the dishes- come on guys you can do it! Also more cheese on the pie- I personally like that they are sauces heavy on the pizza I just need more kick in there. This place has been there for decades and I expect they will be there for several more.  They fill an important  niche in Brooklyn.

I've been coming here since childhood and I will adamantly and passionately defend this pizza when inevitably (if you're from Brooklyn) you get into a heated conversation with someone (also probably from Brooklyn because who else cares this much about pizza) about the best pizza around. Seriously this is a thing. Don't listen to the naysayers who claim to ""know"" that the best pizza is some obscure hole-in-the-wall out in wherever or the place that rhymes with FiFara's.

2617,Jackie K.,0,4,"Like many others, I first heard about L&B on Man vs Food.  Then I went on Yelp, and there were so many people who were raving about how good the Sicilian pizza was.  Now I'll tell you about MY experience, and why I thought the square pizza was fabulous as well.I always want to know, WHY is something so good, and what makes it so different from other versions of the same dish?  After all, you can get pizza anywhere.  The best way that I can describe the difference between an L&B Sicilian slice and those of others is comparable to the difference between a beignet and a donut.  When I first bit into the inch thick pizza, I was expecting it to be flavorful, but a bit heavy and very filling.  To my surprise, the pizza was so delectably fluffy and light, and of course, super flavorful, with the perfect bite to the crust.  YUMMM!!We also tried the famous spumoni ice cream, as well as the strawberry ice cream.  If I could get the flavor of the spumoni ice cream with the smooth consistency of the strawberry ice cream, it would have been ice cream perfection.  The spumoni was good, and specifically, the pistachio ice cream was the shining star, with bits of pistachio nut in the ice cream.  But consistency wise, it was too bubbly creamy for me (I prefer the smooth creaminess of Haagen Dazs ice cream).  The service was terrible.  When we walked in, the hostess (and all of the waiters walking by), completely ignored us for like 5 minutes.  Then, they never checked in on us to take our orders, refill our drinks, or give us our check.  We had to flag down our waiter for every little thing we needed.  I'd recommend just getting the square pizza to go and eating it outside so you don't have to deal with the wait staff.",7/21/2013Previous review,222,138,43,-O57tzZf-qhsAz8uL0hiPA

I came for my bday with my family and although the waiter tried to sell us the 3 course dinner pp, we decided to order a la carte so we could pick different dishes to share, which was a great idea! For a party of 8, we ordered I think it was 5 entrees, 2 appetizers and a pizza, and we still had leftovers.  Even the side dishes are HUGE, and entree size! The BEST: calamari salad! light and yummy, I couldnt stop!  We also tried an interesting tilapia with strawberries (one of the specials), the chicken francese with mushrooms (delish!), the pasta with vodka sauce (ok, a little heavy for my taste), the veal marsala (pretty good)...  For dessert, my dad picked a few of their ice creams (cookies n' cream, rocky road, spumoni) and they were all YUMMY!  Their CHEESECAKE was my favorite! not too cheesy but a great combination of cheese cake and pound cake, YUM-O!!! (not to mention the presentation was monstruous, with lots of whipped cream, sprinkles, etc etc).  Ironically, their famous square pizza was just ok for me.  Even though I like thick crust pizzas, the dough was a little too thick and the flavors were just ok.ATMOSPHERE: there's a big contrast between the interior/exterior of the restaurant.  The dining room looks a LOT better and even has a nice, family-friendly feel.  The take out area and the exterior of the restaurant looks very casual and has a fast food feel.  This is a place you'd go with your family, not on a date.Overall, great value for your buck! would definitely go back!",11/16/2010,713,726,4726,4fM5kiW-haOTm3SCPYgs2w

2625,Matt E.,1,4,"A friends father took us on the ""Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" which was more of an overall Brooklyn tour with stops at Grimaldi's and  L&B's. Two of the most authentic pizza places considered the best of nyc and  obviously the tour guides personal favorite. I didn't think I would likethe tour, seeing how I live in Brooklyn and have been most of the places but It was a very good cool tour with a true brooklynite. Anyway we had the traditional squares here. They were very tasty and the perfect thickness (usually places have a two or more inches of dough thats just too much). They put the sauce on top of the cheese and personally I don't like it done that way and would rather the cheese on top.This place is the real deal, great service, plenty of seating, huge outdoor patio area, walk up window option, and lots of treats (hard/soft ice cream, Italian ice, and their very traditional spumoni). If you haven't had spumoni it's very similar to Italian ice, in fact I couldn't really tell a difference. They only have the original 3 flavors that started this place (chocolate/vanilla/pistachio). Which you can get individually or a mix of all three (word to the wise is the pistachio has pieces of nuts which I could have done without but some people love it that way).UPDATE:I've gone back and tried their regular slices. Those are very average, nothing that great about them. If you're coming here for pizza get the doughy grandma slices with the delicious sauce on top.",6/17/2008,788,2204,1857,M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ

Yummy pizzeria with Italian icees and ice cream? What more can a girl ask for on a cool summer night in Brooklyn? My favorite is their Sicilian (love the concept of putting mozzarella under the sauce) and cherry icee. However, as I get older, the novelty of sitting on crowded, sticky picnic tables has run its course. I now prefer to get the pizza and run straight back to the car to enjoy my food rather than sitting among noisy teenagers.The sit-in restaurant is more formal and the food is consistently good and homey, exactly what one would expect from a Brooklyn Italian restaurant.",3/18/2009,591,962,52,JZ7RPFpDhPHa4ay_wTnRDA

2639,Violet M.,0,3,"As a pizza aficionado, I will travel great lengths for a good slice. Spumoni Gardens, however, located so far out in Brooklyn that if you took the subway one more stop, you'd literally be swimming in the ocean, is a bit of a trip to nowhere. Located in a relatively depressed neighborhood, the restaurant and the outdoor seating area sprawl for almost an entire block like the neighborhood's playground. The famed pizza tasted a bit like puffy bread sticks doused in marinara sauce, with little sprinkles of grated cheese. I was hoping for a more solid and flavorful pie. And it tasted more like a marinara pie, not really pizza. The pizza purist in me was heartbroken.The appetizers were the restaurant's strongest suit. Roasted artichokes looked too good to eat -- little rosebuds with stems on a plate. Mozzarella in carrozza was my favorite, melted cheese between slivers of bread. Yummiest thing there.The dessert is massive, but the ice cream tasted too much like dyed Italian ices, and was watery.Our server was incredibly accommodating and helpful, and assisted everyone with picking out a dinner special that fit their budget. On the downside, getting back to wherever you had to return to after a filling meal (plus leftovers), was a drag.",12/9/2012Previous review,59,17,0,u9rb2A1Etd5F08tskteBOA

2641,Andy C.,0,5,"Mmm, can't get enough of the spumoni. The first time I actually had L&B's was after I lost a high school handball game so needless to say, I had no appetite haha. I had the regular slice the first time and it wasn't that great, the square slice though is very tasty. Not sure how busy this place gets but when I was ordering and took a peek in the back, they were making about 20 pies to go. Everything came out quickly, not too much of a wait and there was a lot of  outdoor seating. Definitely would come back again, for both the pizza and spumoni.",8/24/2013,776,138,31,4zUi7exGanxHz_zXJuHjMw

2649,Louis P.,0,5,"When reviewing this pizza place you really can't compare it to other establishments because of 2 reasons:1) Spumoni Gardens is in many ways the food version of a mini-shopping center, you have the smaller pizza take-out place with a small sitting area inside, you have the ice cream store next to it and then you have the restaurant. All of this with outdoor seating that allows you to pay for each and then sit. 2) The main attraction here is a type of pizza that is not your typical slice. The signature L&B square has the sauce on top of the cheese, and the sauce has lots of sugar in it making it very sweet and giving it a unique taste not like your other pizza joints.Bottom line is the pizza is fantastic, you can easily eat 5 squares before you begin feeling full. The prices are high for something that may not look so big to you at first, but the taste fully makes up for that. I suggest you sit in their outdoor area to get the full experience.",10/20/2010,371,621,962,EUlfxYKZSO7esvntG3HfOQ
2650,Evan M.,0,5,"This is more than an italian eatery; it's an experience. At this legendary landmark you will find what Brooklyn is all about. If you are one of these people that shy away from local color and are only comfortable around transplants, then this isn't for you. You got kids running around hopped up on dessert. You might see two guys engaged in a stare down competition over who is wearing a better gold chain. If you saw this place on the show Man vs. Food then you might know a little bit of what I'm talking about. First off, it's not a pizza. Don't call it that. It's a square. If you try to categorize it as pizza you are on the wrong track. The sauce is what really stands out and not just because its covered in it. The bread is also thick, soft and doughy. I felt like I could eat about ten of these.When I came here I didn't even know what a spumoni was and I still don't think I know. Is it an icy? Is it ice cream? Both? Whatever it was, it was like crack in a cup. I went with the pistachio and it was so flavorful that I thought it had to be artificial. It was that good. I'm told they make it on the premises and everything they use is the real ingredient. This really is an oasis out in the middle of Gravesend and it's been around since 1939. With the crowds it was drawing and the amount of double parking going on, I can see why.",7/21/2011,96,320,158,AkAbdFcW_xtTnwB-89vr8A
2651,Heather S.,0,3,"I finally gave in to the L&B hype and decided to come here as an impromptu date night with my boyfriend. We showed up around 8:30pm to find a crowded outdoor area and a relatively quiet inside dining area. We decided we'd start off by splitting a ""square"" (Sicilian slice) and then moved on to the entrees. He got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and I decided on the Eggplant Sicilian. In all honesty the pizza was worth 4.5 stars (this is according to him - the pizza guru). It was thick, but not dense, and it wasn't slathered in cheese like some places tend to do to their pies. As for the rest of the food - we agreed.. a solid 2.5 stars. The shrimp/mussels in his dish were large, but the dish as a whole lacked the flavor expected. He was pretty convinced the penne he got with it was whole wheat and therefore even more disappointed with his plate.Mine was mediocre. I kinda expected it to be pretty awesome because I had never had eggplant done that way, but it was only ""meh"" at best. I wish I had went with the Calamari Salad which looked pretty amazing.The service was good, so no complaints there.I'm sure we'll back back for a few slices of their ""squares"" as the weather warms up, but as for the entrees we'll make it a point to skip them.",5/12/2011,190,338,56,ZrW6MCytmafkuIHXDpFvyA

2663,Joshua K.,0,4,"Nothing screams Brooklyn, Summertime, and Italian more than L&B's. If you are a pizza fan, especially Sicilian slices, be prepared to be blown away. During the summer, nothing beats grabbing a 1/2 tray of Sicilian slices, a spumoni Italian Ice with some of your friends while sitting on the benches in the front of the restaurant. Even though their regular slices are good as well, the Sicilian is what they're known for. Baked to crunchy perfection, topped with light Parmesan cheese and homemade tomato sauce, the Sicilian is hands down one of the best in the city. Just be careful, because sometimes the slices can be over drenched in sauce, so remind the counter to go easy with the sauce on your pie. When you're done chowing down on your Sicilian slices, make sure you grab a homemade Italian Ice as well. I usually get the lemon ice, which literally has lemon seeds in it, which vouches for it's freshness.

My colleagues had been raving about their pies so much that I couldn't resist but make the trip to a part of town that is quite spartan. As every other review has already attested, there is a separate window for whole pies and to be sure, its the economical option. I got a sicilian which I think stands for, 'load up the dough' and slogged my way thru two slices. It really wasn't my thing and perhaps I'll make a trip there again to try the round new york style pies but even the sauce was average for New York standards.",12/29/2015,0,9,0,Sl6HqHHOHfogYRbqfqgyeA

Kind of strange how they could be so good with one style of pizza and mediocre (at best) with the other.  But seems like a majority of their patrons go for the square anyway.Their sit-in restaurant has surprisingly excellent food too.   Also, their spumoni is off the charts good.  I'd have given them 5 stars if not for their crappy round pies.",12/26/2013,8,38,0,GVdZvWUJiqwnAFJJj5jE6A

Get an Italian ice or spumoni to wash it down. Simple, yet absolutely delicious!",8/4/2011,51,180,78,O6iV8iVRoSzvAP3zQm_OZQ

2699,Matthew H.,0,4,"Easily the best Sicilian style pizza in town, and a summer staple of South Brooklyn worth checking out for the pizza alone.  Unlike most NY slices this pizza comes in doughy, fluffy squares topped with chewy cheese and a slightly tart tomato sauce.  The combination is quite filling, and the garlic salt on the crust is perfectly crisp though there are few edges in their generous pans.  Needless to say it will leave a memorable impression of what pizza that's distinct from other parlors around town.A half tray of pizza easily feeds 4-6 with leftovers.  I like to bring guests from out of town to try their pizza, which makes a great stop before and after visits to Coney Island.",12/15/2015,162,42,6,NuBaublImQ5RJ8FKO_xZfQ
2700,Eric F.,0,5,"I was only introduced to spumoni's 1 year ago, and every time I head to Brooklyn I go out of my way to stop and get a few slices.    The pizza is nice and crisp-along the edges only.  The sauce is a bit on the sweet side, but it is still tangy enough to complement the 2 cheeses they use.The spumoni is also fantastic.  I haven't had the opportunity to sit down and dine inside, but next time I get my brothers in town that might be an excursion.  If anything, you have to go and at least see for yourself-hell, they've been around since the late 30's, so they must be doing some thing right.",1/2/2011,0,21,0,mbob8yazrE1lv3y3DFL87w

I think that the pizza at Original's Avenue L and MY little Pizzeria on Court Street (same owner) have better Sicilian.  The Sicilian here was good but the sauce was very cheesy tasting to me and I do not really care for that taste.  It was good but maybe not worth the trek.  If you are in the area I would definitely check them out but you can get much better pizza in Brooklyn at other pizzeria's such as the two that I named and of course there is Difara :)",6/17/2012Previous review,197,53,12,ANzR73RKDqk4w5jTCDWyug

I had both the round and square for only $2.25 each. I think I prefer the round a little better. It folded perfectly and had all of the makings of your traditional pizza. The square was unique, but a tad too saucy for me. You have to give them both a try to decide. Plenty of seating even on a busy Saturday afternoon.

I actually wanted to eat things off other people's tables, THAT'S how good everything looks. However, I could only eat so much and the pizza was on my ""must-eat"" list after seeing it on Man v. Food.  I trust Adam's opinion on NYC pizza, so I left my Manhattan apartment in search of Spumoni Gardens wayyyyyy out in Brooklyn. The crust is just unbelievable - soft, chewy and warm like no crust I've tasted before. The service was crappy, but I will not dare deduct a star for service when the pizza is that good.

The pizza was yummy, definitely not what I was expecting (and I'm not talking about the hair) - the sauce had a nice ""edge"" to it and the crust was spot-on.  The strawberry salad was very fresh and the ample serving of goat cheese came in a separate container.  Sitting at a picnic table eating the spumoni from a paper container brought me back to my youth.   And so did the 80s tunes playing in the background.As I have been hearing about the famous Spumoni Gardens for years and from many different sources, I assume the hair in our first pie was just a weird fluke.  And since the staff had absolutely no problem giving us a new pie, all was quickly forgotten.",7/5/2011,50,137,0,hhOi02O0hGBEcx5BU4LHAA

2723,Richard W.,0,3,"Decided to give this place a shot Friday. I stopped by on the the way home from work. I got there around 6:00pm. I was expecting a long line but surprisingly there wasn't any. I walked into the takeout section, and ordered a half pie squares. I was expecting to wait a few mintues when the counter guy turns around and grabs a pie from the top of the stove. I noticed there were over a dozen pies boxed and ready to go just sitting on top of the oven. As he was bringing the premade pie to the counter I glanced over and saw a fresh pie being placed into the box. I pointed to that pie and asked if I can have that pie. The counter guy pointed to the premade box and said this is the same. I touched the top of the box and it felt warm, not hot. I was in a rush and not in a mood to start my weekend off arguing over a pie. I paid the  20 bux and went home.By the time I got home, the pie was slightly warm and not hot, ( I only live 10 minute drive)  So the luke warm square was tasty. the sauce was sweet and the bottom was crispy. So if you want a hot pie, go later in the evening when they'll be serving fresh out of the oven pies and not ones they've premade.nothing like the wait for a FRESH HOT PIE from DiFara's",11/2/2013,3,55,0,EC_geqItqzZca4NSgxMU_g

Their round pizzas are nothing to write home about, but the squares are what everyone and their grandmas stop by for.

While the pizza is memorable, it would only warrant four stars.However, the indoors restaurant is the final kicker. Service is fast and simply amazing. I can think of no other restaurant in New York that has the same commitment to its customers. While I've never met Lenny, the waiters would offer unmatched attention, making for a pleasant experience. They really go beyond the requirements for what I consider to make for a pleasant experience. One time, I was informed that they ran out of burgers. They were gracious enough to whip up a tasty dessert of brownies, hot fudge, ice cream, and strawberries for us. This is place is definitely worth it.

2739,Jeff L.,0,4,"An interesting slice.  It's Sicilian but I guess it's Grandma style.  They actually compose the pizza by putting the cheese on first then smothering it with sauce then sprinkling parmesan on top.  The logic is that placing the cheese prevents any sogginess in the crust...they use a lot of crust.  I enjoyed it...it's hard to compare to other Sicilian slices I've had because it's so different.  Forget comparisons, I think their version of the Sicilian slice is very good...I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but opted for 4 because I really like the huge outdoor area they have going on.  It feels sort of like a blast ifrom the past and you have kids, families, older people all gathered around enjoying anything from calamari, pizza, to ice cream.  It was a pleasure eating pizza outdoors on a Saturday night while drinking 2 dollar cans of bud.btw, the restaurant looked great...I'll have to go back and try.  The portions looked tremendous...like you come here to eat...eat like Tony Soprano or Fat Pussy.",11/14/2010,15,14,10,UbsZkOQQrig-IYAmeYSFZw

We stuck to the plan and ordered a small Sicilian with sausage.The pizza arrived and we were anxious to dig in. The sauce was spot on, the sausage was in thin slices, which was unexpected, but it was really good. The pizza reminded me of Chicago style pan pizza. The crust was thick and pillowy.

2756,Eileen N.,0,4,"You know a place is good when it can withstand the test of time. Nearby Bensonhurst (where I have lived for 25 years) has undergone a major transformation in recent years from predominantly Italian to Asian/Russian, but it doesn't seem to have made a dent in this establishment. In fact, this is the only restaurant in the area where it is very possible that you will have to double park to get in on their food during the summer months.On the far left, you can pick up your standard slice or the Sicilian slice (which is the type of pizza people are mostly there for). I would say equally popular is their Rainbow Spumoni, which you can find in the outside middle, left section (or inside during the colder months). If you aren't into that, they do sell regular Italian ices and ice cream. When you go through the doors to the middle, right section you can pick up hot sandwiches or entrees. Then you can take it to go or sit on the benches outside. Finally, they have an indoor dining section for a more proper setting on the right. I would recommend anyone to visit L&B's if you are in the area. I've introduced friends who subsequently make visits on their own. I would say the chances of someone liking it are on the favorable side. For those who are on a special diet, such as low grease, fat or are lactose intolerant, then I would, of course, advise against coming in as you are signing up for a disappointment.",8/3/2011,51,14,3,A_mB5xgf2Zo5ub-388OZaQ

Be careful that you don't burn yourself with the pizza. I burned the roof of my mouth taking a bite but still ended up eating 3 Sicilian slices through the pain. Hey at least you know it's fresh!! I can't say much about the customer service when ordering pizza because the environment is so fast paced. However the ice cream guys are pretty nice.

So cold in fact we had to ask them to turn up the heat not only for our 1 year old sitting between us but so we could feel our fingers and toes.  Even that brought on a dirty look from our waiter, who also scoffed at us when we asked for a high chair and forgot - so we asked the guy who served us water.Like I said, poor service has become the norm, especially when it gets a bit crowded, but to treat you as if they don't care or need you? ...that is just unacceptable.",12/15/2010,2,10,2,HR00otGTP9gDs5jBd4kWYQ

They have a large outdoor area with picnic tables and take out windows, great for warm night and sunny days. They have a dine-in area too, but it didn't look that appealing. To be honest, I'm not a Sicilian pizza person; I find Sicilian slices to be a waste of carbs with all that thick dough, but much to my surprise it can be very good. We tried a middle, corner, and side slice. You might think that there isn't a difference, oh but there is... the middle is much more undercooked, so you have more doughiness/chewiness. I personally didn't like it as much as the side slice, where you had good proportions of crust to cheese ratio, good crispness from side and on the bottom. The corner had too much crust for me and not enough sauce and cheese to compensate for the extra dough. All 3 had good crunch on the bottom. We also ordered fried calamari, which was terrible. The marinara sauce for dipping tasted like water downed tomato sauce with extra sugar or ketchup. The calamaris itself lacked flavor too.   In summary, order a side slice of pizza and go to the next window and order a large spumoni.

The only thing about my experience here that knocks it down to four stars is the spotty service.  Both times I've been here, it's been hard to track down waiters for simple and reasonable requests such as soda refills, and both of my parties were left sitting for far too long waiting for our checks.",4/5/2010,775,625,1144,j1IpRoDB4_EGalcFItxCxg

I never leave here dissatisfied. L&B is a Brooklyn institution. Go! Go NOW!",5/20/2013,34,20,8,9PWCSDgE46i4BdjaswCY1w
2807,Michael F.,0,5,A long time ago when I went to high school I used to eat here all the time. This place I think is popular across the world for their pizza. If you live in NYC you should have a slice for here.,7/9/2013,59,23,6,iA84UpM9n8RH-NvBiHkPyg
2808,G S.,0,5,"The Sicilian pizza is amazing. The BEST I've had living in nyc for 12 years. Terrible service (rolling their eyes if you ask for a cup of water). Avoid any hassle and wait by going on a warm day - eat outside and order a whole Sicilian pie (no wait, separate line for whole pies).

2810,Laura M.,0,2,"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  So we left the beach on a hot sunny Sunday to eat.  As usual, L & B was super crowded.  Our party of 6 was seated quickly.  Mussels as an appetizer took a really long time and when finally served were tasteless.  Simply put they were blah.  In their defense of slow service the wait staff and bus boys work their tails off.The portions are plentiful but the food itself, not good.  All of the pasta dishes were awful.  Pasta was overcooked and the meatballs on one entre weren't even cooked!  That was sent back.  The vodka sauce had little actual taste and it was greasy.  The broccali was so over cooked it wasn't even green. We waited so long for the food that while we waited for the bill, my son went outside to get us spumoni that we ate at the table.  Spumoni it still the best but they should close that restaurant and focus on pizza (which is way too doughy for my taste) and ice cream!  Never again.",8/17/2015,0,74,0,d4Jic7SeS9OWWLBDc_HlRw
2811,Roger V.,0,4,"Absolutely amazing Sicicilian style pizza. You look at the pie (square pie that is) when it comes out and it's fairly intimidating. It's a good 1""-1"" 1/2 thick with aggresive crust and smothered in sauce. When you actually bite into it though...magical. The crust is as light and flaky as philo dough and the sauce...oh my lord the sauce is unebleivable. Light, bright with just a little acid and sweetness from the San Marzano tomatoes. In fact, the only reason why this isn't a perfect 5 stars is the service was dreadfully slow. Other than that...top 3 pizzas I've ever eaten.",2/10/2013,2,98,13,H-NXEPbaEpP20EBGsJobWw

2813,Vivian L.,0,5,"My go-to place, I'm always craving their Spumoni. Never have I enjoyed banana flavored ice cream unless it's mixed with chocolate and pistachio. I usually get the quart size. They raised up all their prices, Sicilian slice by $2.75 and Large Spumoni for $3.75.

2816,C. Marie ..,0,1,I feel like I'm missing what all the hype is about??? Everyone always rants and raves about this place and I really don't see why. I found their sicilian pizza to be bland and extra greasy. I never eat frozen pizza but I just may have preferred that over l&b's. So not worth the calories or money to eat this lol,7/20/2012,78,36,6,ppQVbzHl2wVhhT8E05Q1mQ
2817,Kimberly M.,0,1,"This place is definitely overrated, don't be fooled by the 1000+ ""amazing"" reviews. I tried the calamari salad. I was impressed with the amount of calamari that came in the salad, but other then that i was left comepletely dissatisfied. I honestly couldnt even appreciate how tender the calamari actually was. Between the 3 inches of olive oil at the bottom of my bowl and the unnecessary amount of black and green olives (which didnt add anything to the dish), I was left completely unsatisfied. Thinking that I made a mistake by getting the calamari, my friend told me that the Sicilian slice was nothing to right home about. Next we tried the ""Famous Handmade"" Rainbow Spumoni....to put it in a nutshell, don't waste your money...it taste completely processed and was extremely grainy. The chocolate taste like hot chocolate mix and the pistachio ice cream was as green as NYC street signs. BOTH of us threw out our ice cream and realized it wasn't worth the extra 30 minutes at the gym.",5/4/2015,57,12,0,WqQh3DvAdtF94ThfnPpEoA

2819,Bay T.,0,4,Great sicilian pizza! Love the amounts of sauce and cheese on their squares. Pkus the dough is so chewy which I love. Minus the one star because sometimes their sauce on the pizza can come out overly salty. It really depends which pizza are you getting your slices from.,2/23/2013,14,17,5,iN2_7h6bCwsv4VcqlzXoDQ
2820,Vincent L.,0,5,L&B Spumoni Gardens have the best sicilian square pizza in town. This place is like a gold mine to me. Their sicilian square pie is made so good that the hot juicy tomatoes sauce and cheese melt in my mouth which put me in cloud nine. Their pizza dough are made nice and crispy as well. Place is pack and there is always a line but move pretty quick. The sicilian square pie are made fresh daily. If you never have their sicilian square pie then your missing out. Everyone that comes here leave with a box or two of their famous square pie pizza. Not just that but leaving  L&B Spumoni Gardens with a cool aid smile. definitely coming back for more sicilian square pie pizza.,1/28/2013,39,39,33,P8r401KHiSXlgBEEDoVRyQ
2821,Vincent B.,0,1,"It's basically the worst pizza ever made. But people seem to enjoy burnt cardboard crust, no cheese, and hair in their food. It's no wonder there is a long line of fat people who probably are so tired from standing for more than one minute that they rush their food down their throats without anytime to even taste the damn thing. If they had any taste buds, they'd probably refuse to eat certain foods every once in a while, and maybe they wouldn't fall into the obese category of the BMI scale. Chew your food, taste it! This place is gross! If you actually like the taste of food, J & V on 18th ave is the place to go for pizza and any other dough, cheese and sauce related foods.",8/26/2013,4,6,0,Pys4KxhSbfdzzDDUfi5bxw

2824,Gee K.,0,4,"I've never had pizza quite like the square slice here at LB Spumoni Gardens. Yes, I have had ""sicilian"" style pizza. Yes, I have had thick crust and Chicago deep dish. Yes, I have had every type of artisinal and neapolitan pizza. And every interpretation of utility pizza and new age vegan pies. All put on traditional, sourdough, pita, cracker, you-name-it-I've-had it crusts. And yes, I have had the square pie at DiFara (still one of my all time favorites).This pizza achieves two things right off the bat. It is light and fluffly and its chewy gooey. All within a light crisp crust. Unlike DiFara square, the crust is not heavily fattened up and takes only a light crisping in the oven, versus a deep crisp texture. The dough however, grows to monsterous height. Like a good slice of Texas toast. But instead of meeting with a slice of cheddar, this dough melts....no FUSES, mozz cheese straight into itself. It does this so well that one cannot tell when dough stops and cheese starts.And just as your jaw is fusing the crust/dough/cheese together the sauce comes in with a hit of acidity. POW, keeping each bite seperated. Otherwise you'd be lost in a cheese/dough dream.I appreciate all types of pizza. My favorite being more thin crust and neapolitan wood-fired types. But I also love a well made slice that carries with it neighborhood pride and a good deal of history. If I grew up in the Bay Ridge area I could easily see this being my feeling of home. A warm and doughy comfort food perfect for sharing with the family, friends, and loved ones.",9/19/2010,126,31,2,cyfvdfhl8MsGv78P3PUgGQ

I think the other flavors were vanilla and chocolate. It was rich and filling. I dont think I enjoyed it as much as I hoped. I would rather have gelato.

2829,Trevor L.,0,4,"I really love this place, it is as Brooklyn as Brooklyn can be - it makes you want to bust out the polyester leisure suit, white patent leather platforms and the butterfly collar, check yourself out in the mirror and compare yourself to Al Pachino while shooting off the finger guns. They have walk up window service for pizza and for spumoni, and yu can sit outside and people watch, which more than compensates you for the negligible price of your food.They serve pizza in triangle and square forms (Neopolitan and Sicilian for all of you high falootin' fancy pants yelpers). DO NOT order triangles, go with the squares - it's what this place is known for. The sauce is on the top, and it is delicious while being terrible for you at the same time. Bloomberg and the City Council are probably fuming about this place as we speak.After you have a few squares, and go back for more and eat those, you will want to order spumoni. This is real gelato, not the edy's grand stuff you can buy at the supermarket. Served in a little paper cup, old school brooklyn style.Spumoni Gardens is a perfect place to stop after a long day at Coney Island. Good for kids, and you get free entertainment in people watching.

The pizza tasted AMAZING ! And let me tell you, I am not even a big pizza fan, but when I say is good pizza, it has to be. The pasta was pretty decent good flavor but I had to add a little bit of salt and the fried calamari apetizer came in a huge portion we couldn't finish it.

L&B Spumoni Gardens was the first stop. They brought the pie with the square slices and I said, ""WAIT, that ain't new york pizza...."" like the ignorant Michigander that I genetically am. I took one bit of this thing and it completely rewrote my view of what PIZZA is and should be. It was simply amazing. Before I used to think I knew my NYC pizza as well as the next guy. My favorites were Joe's, Grimaldi's, John's and all the other cliches listed at the top of every Yelper's ""BEST NY PIZZA"" list. I must say, this pizza DESTROYED those pizza's. In fact, it was only matched by 2 of the other stops we went two afterwards that are not one of the above mentioned shops.The square slice is pretty basic. Kind of like a deep dish style with the bread, cheese and THEN the marinara.... IT WAS AWESOME!!!I honestly think if Di Fara's has climbed its way to the top of the Yelp Hot Places list (as it rightfully should), this place should also be on the list of places Manhattan yelpers should be willing to make a trek to.

I mean real soggy, like there's no crunch underneath. So i did what i normally do w/ these slices - squueze the cheese and sauce into my mouth, eat the crust and then dump the rest onto the plate and onwards to the trashcan.I ordered an entree also months b4 that slice.

2859,Jenny T.,0,5,"The best sicilian slice, ever.It's been featured on travel channels, food network, etc.For less than $3 it is a must try!I live 2 blocks from here and people from other boroughs have come here just for L&B's pizza. It is delicious, affordable, and has a variety of other food if you don't feel like getting pizza. Although it is more known for its spumoni, I love the gelato here especially the new hazelnut flavor. Sitting at the outside tables, eating the best pizza with friends on a nice summer night = unbeatable :)Definitely 5 stars !",3/6/2013,3,60,11,EOLY68yKSNFukt8d6wSrSg
2860,Foodie I.,0,4,"I came here yesterday for dinner. I was seated promptly and greeted immediately.I ordered baked clams and seafood salad for an appetizer to share.The baked clams were small but came as a dozen. They were crispy and juicy, and honestly perfect.The seafood salad was a huge portion. There were a couple shrimp, mussels, and loads of squid marinated with lemon, garlic, roasted peppers, and fresh basil. Would definitely order this again.For the entree I shared an order of chicken francese with pasta. The chicken was juicy and tender, and came with sauteed mushrooms, which was unusual, but a pleasant surprise. The whole bill for two large appetizers and an entree, a glass of wine and a soda was $50. I left stuffed with a doggie bag. After dinner I had spumoni outside which was also cheap and delicious. If you never been here it is definitely recommended for a tasty, filling, cheap meal! =)",6/27/2011,1,45,4,F-elqtC_12xbZ05-yUo47g

I discovered this place when a friend of mine who grew up in Brooklyn repped it as the ""best pizza in NYC"", so i'm like alright let's give this a shot. Oh did it not disappoint! The Sicilian or 'square pizza', is f'in amazing. It's like a pasta sauce (really hearty and fresh)  on top of perfectly crisp crust. Spumoni Gardens was probably one of my favorite places in all of Brooklyn to get that ""I'm craving some calories"" comfort food. I moved back to Vegas back in 07' but I go back to NYC every winter, and you know where I always have to go? Spumoni Gardens. It's that good.",6/24/2015,42,37,2,P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA

2866,Jess B.,0,4,"The last time I went to Spumoni Gardens, I was seven years old. At that time, I thought it was the most magical place in the world, with its extra saucy pizza and unusually-mixed-but-delicious ice cream. Fourteen years later, not much has changed (although I don't know why, but I remembered it being located next to a highway...I was quite wrong about that). I don't need to say much about the sicilian and the spumoni; everyone else has said a'plenty prior. What I CAN say is that the broccoli rabe with garlic and oil is on par with my ex's father's recipe. That is a huge huge compliment, because that man makes an amazing rabe. The one complaint I have about the place is that the woman waitress who gave me and my friends our check had a huge attitude and threw a calculator at us when we were having a bit of trouble dividing up the bill. That wasn't very attractive, but the minor predicament didn't ruin the night.",6/1/2010,41,218,1,QMDBx5JniWfeL26ZdnaCPA
2867,Nelson X.,0,3,"Can't find a police officer?  Look no further than L&B.  Half of the local precinct was eating in here.  For a minute, I thought I blacked out and woke up in the Donut Pub.The place has 2 entrances.  The center entrance serves as the gateway for the sit down wait service restaurant, the Italian specialties for take out and the spumoni take out.The other entrance is for pizza only.  Disregard the sign that says whole pies only, the place sells individual slices and squares.  My review encompasses only the pizza and spumoni.The place is a factory; cranking out fresh hot pizza.  Given the crowds, I never saw them re-heating any pizza.  Don't worry, despite the lines, you'll get served within a minute.I saw them making the squares and they layer paper thin slices of cheese on top of the dough before lading on a generous amount of sauce on top.  This actually allows the dough to cook and become crusty throughout.  The pie gets sprinkled with olive oil and a dusting of pecorino.The square slice was like bruschetta.  toasty, crusty bread with tomato sauce.  You could barely taste any cheese.  It was okay but not great.  If you grew up eating this as a kid, add another star.The regular slice is the complete opposite of the square slice.  It barely has any sauce and was cheesy by comparison.  The dough was a bit undercooked for my taste.Do as any other Brooklynite, stick with the squares.Afterwards, I stopped by for a neon green pistacchio spumoni.  It was 20 degrees outside but if you're going to trek all the way here, you may as well try it.  Overall, I've had better pizza (including squares) and spumoni elsewhere.  If you are going to travel out of your way for pizza, I would stick with Difara's, Totonno's or Grimaldi's.Cheers!N.",6/21/2010,13,138,6,9Tsvhx8dvOyHPNvpJqthvw

The cheese is perfect and the pepperoni just adds to a already great pie of pizza.The other thing that is good is the ice cream. I've had pistachio with I think vanilla and chocolate. I don't really remember. Might have been strawberry, but I don't think I had it with strawberry. I'd say the pistachio was top notch. I'm a sucker for vanilla and chocolate, but the pistachio ice cream was great. Even if you don't go for the pizza, try the ice cream, especially around summer time.It's an outdoor environment so expect some nose, but it's not a bad thing. I find it compliments the place and makes it more down to earth and personable.

2876,Eric L.,0,2,"I've been a long time fan of this neighborhood haunt but last evening was a disaster!!!!  The service was subpar with the waiters throwing straws for drinks on the table as they walked by and putting the dinner plates anywhere without clearing the used dishes. When the food arrived in a disorganized order, my Shrimp cocktail was loosely thrown on a plate of lettuce with a huge blob of cocktail sauce.  The shrimp must have been from freezer section from a local supermarket and very over cooked. My main course (an old staple of this place) chicken parm with rigatoni, the chicken was good but the mozzarella wasn't melted properly and the sauce was splattered on- very messing.   This wasn't the end my dining experience at L&B, the bus boys used the bread knife to cut a plastic garbage bag open and without wiping it they began to cut the table bread.  Also they dropped the butter packets on the floor scooped them off the floor and onto someone's tables while they were not looking.  That was totally gross!!! There was also another issue with the butter served on my table, it was so melted!  It must have been out of the fridge for hours.   I can't begin to say how disappointed I was with my experience which is normally an above average meal.  Hope they go back the old L&B...  Deeply disappointed.",6/20/2010,0,9,8,9zTKVOZSirrdWY0lvKr81w
2877,P C.,0,2,"For as long as I can remember, people have been talking about this place. I've heard so many variations of the name that sometimes people would be talking about it and I'd have no clue what they're talking about. Names range from Spumoni's to Spumoni Gardens to L&B and so on. I've only ever heard good things about this place. Mainly people proclaiming the Sicilian Slice to be the best ever. I was once brought here by a former coworker and after admitting that I've never been here before he immediately exclaimed that I just had to try the best Sicilian Slice. He was from Long Island so I don't even know how he became a Spumoni pizza expert. I agreed on the Sicilian and after all the hype surrounding this thing I was expecting heaven on earth or something of the sort. What I got was a thick piece of bread and chunky tomato sauce with cheese that reminded me of the pizzas you get for lunch back in grade school. Yuck.Can someone tell me what it is that I might not be comprehending here? Is it supposed to be like school lunch? Couldn't I just go visit a random school cafeteria for that? Honestly it wasn't good at all. But then again my bias is that I hate the crust on pizza unless it's thin and crunchy so that might be it. Maybe but maybe not.What I do like about this place is the ample seating that they provide. There are many seats inside but just as many outside as well. It's great in the summer when all the locals come to grab a slice and just hang out and relax outside. They have ice cream too!",6/7/2015,235,206,145,w1crYZOvvNNRbt-PnqSzCg

The sicilian slice is absolutely average, it's like those school french pizzas, very doughy, a bit of a crunch on the bottom, and what appears and tasted like plain tomato sauce from the can. It is very saucy and extremely average in taste. You can buy some regular bread, toast it in the oven, open a can of sauce, dip it in said sauce with some cheese. The pastas are HORRIBLE. I had the carbonaro, just plain box pasta with the greasiest most oily sauce I ever had and I eat coconut oil for breakfast. It's just so average, so so so soooooo average. Also the free bread they give is stale, only comes with butter. Even pizzerias give olive oil with their bread.

Perfection. Amazing tasting spumoni, and some DELICIOUS peanut butter swirl ice cream (if that's your thing). The sit-down restaurant section, next door to where they serve the pizza, has some fantastic food as well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because: (a) their fettucini alfredo always felt like something was slightly off or perhaps missing. (b) The prices are going up (which I normally wouldn't have a problem with) but it seems their slice sizes are going down as well!Aside from those 2 qualms, however, I heart Spumoni Gardens, big time!",7/27/2010,188,186,171,z-DgYXpa2BVgPAhCn2_wFw

As for the quality of the slice, it was nothing special.  The sauce wasn't chunky or seasoned very nicely, and I found it to be way too sweet.  The crust was decent, but the tomato paste based sauce really detracted from the experience.  There was a slight dusting of cheap parmesan cheese on top that was kind of an afterthought.I also took home a quart of spumoni that was an absolute joke.  The most artificial, neon green crap I have ever seen.  I was very surprised and taken aback that a place with spumoni in its name would serve such an inferior product.  I will not be back, ever.",3/20/2010,30,187,4,R5pl1N7Ecn4qm8ckjAKQuQ

2891,Stacey S.,0,3,"If I reviewed them 20 years ago, it would get five stars, but the square pizza crust is just not what it used to be, has not been crispy on the bottom for the last few years. I thought it was because I was getting a half a pie, and they put it in the box and store it on top of the ovens, so it can get soggy, but I ordered slices the last few times I was there, and it was still not crispy. That is sad because the sauce and cheese is still outstanding. I am originally from the neighborhood and have been going there since birth, and I remember that it used to be crispy. My father remembers when they used to just sell spumoni from the cart on the street. The spumoni is still worth five stars, though. Please don't go there and get an icee. You must get spumoni.

2907,Tiffany L.,0,1,I'm so sad to write this review. I would prefer to give a big fat ZERO but I just came home from this place and I was beyond disgusted with the service and food. Asked for red wine. I got an ice cold glass of wine. Wine that was so cold it must've been in the back of the fridge. Who drinks frozen red wine??? We ordered two appetizers (baked clams and calamari.) And two entrees (fried chicken cutlet ceasar salad and penne ala vodka) and two square slices for my son for dinner. My husband's app came first. Then his entree. No complaints on his food. Then my entree which was probably the worse penne I ever tasted in my life. It was bland cream with peas and such a yellow color it looked like turmeric was added to the dish. It was inedible. I couldn't even eat it. We had to ask where my sons pizza was to 3 different guys as our admitting server was MIA. It's like they forgot about us totally. How do you forget to serve the kid FIRST. kids should always get their food first. Not last. What kid wants to wait for pizza. Their pizza was good when it finally arrived. Finally the brought my baked clams which was my app after my entree. They were not that great clams were so tiny it's not like you can make someone happy with the size of them. They knew they messed up tonight and took the clams off the bill. Mind you. My husband is a chef and has owned a restaurant in the past. We won't ever come back to this place. I would rather sit outside and eat the pizza as take out. I won't ever come back to dine inside. I have never been so eager to write a review like I was tonight immediately coming home after eating at this place. I'm hungry I'm mad and I will now eat cereal because this place sucks.,3/11/2016,32,25,26,FcPB8Y4-Td1aeX2U4Qk2Rw
2908,Liz T.,0,4,"It's all about the squares.  There are a plethora of pizza options all over Brooklyn, but this is the place to go to when you want a sweet Sicilian Square slice.  The crust is slightly flaky and crispy on the outside with a soft and cheesy dough on the inside. The seasoning and sauce are light-and that seemingly simplistic taste is rather heavenly.  I didn't think I would go crazy over a thick slice of pizza, but this is pretty wonderful. If you like ice cream, I really like their rainbow spumoni.  You can even take it home in cartons if you like it that much.  It's cheap, tasty and wonderful when the humidity just won't quit.  As for the soft chocolate ice cream, it's rich and creamy like ice cream should be.Yes it's crowded- but that's because it tastes good.",3/29/2010,4,35,0,_aS2BgBSwlEWcsH_6icnZg

2910,Chenlin T.,0,1,"I usually don't write bad comments about restaurants but I had to for this specifically rude incident I was involved in. The restaurant is actually good, Sicilian slice is So good, even the serving staff and young guys. This review is about this specific hostess and her male sidekick. She was the hostess but old like a grandmother, maybe she was a relative of the owners. She took my name while I waited in the waiting area that was packed with people. My family had no space to even wait so they waited in the car half a block away. Even their parking lot was full. My name was called so I call my family to come over and I tell the hostess. She rudely asks, ""is your party here?"" I said yes but she immediately says "" if they are then you wouldn't be on your phone."" A male staff snorkels hearing her remark and she even giggles with him. So I hurry to explain, ""they are sitting in the car cause there's no place to stand, they are coming now."" So she like a teacher reprimanding a student tells me, ""then don't say they are here."" This made me upset, we all waited for a table like everyone else, my family arrived in a few minutes btw. She could've just said "" I can't seat you till everyone is here"", I will be fine with that. She really should not be a hostess when she can't be cordial, or be respectful to another human being. She uses a rude and demeaning tone.",5/9/2016,0,3,0,OrPAqTgteUj63QeMSTcLOQ

Ahh yes Spumoni Gardens. If you want a sicilian that's different from the rest, come here! It's not your usual mozzarella layered over the sauce, it is hidden underneath the sauce and topped off with some parmigiana cheese. The sauce is a bit sweeter than your usual sicilian, and depending on the day you go, the dough might not be as thoroughly cooked as it is on other days. Whichever way you get it, it's still awesome. My suggestion? Go for a half a tray, and if you're a female with nails on the longer side, opt for the corners so you can hold onto the crust, unless of course you have a fork and knife. One other thing, during warm months, this place will be packed, there will be no place to sit and eat or park your car.",7/27/2010,23,142,35,8n8Rq2h5DyzrXRvBmPEEXQ

The staff is not exactly friendly but the food is good. I also had the eggplant parmesan that was delicious. The portions are huge.Their spumoni and gelatos are fantastic after every meal. They offer take-out, drive through with outdoor benches or dining in the restaurant.  We ate in but the tables can get pretty crowded.

Don't come here for a regular slice (if you want a regular slice, go to Di Fara's in Midwood). Instead, get the squares! They're the best you can find anywhere in this continent. Sauce and herbs on the outside, cheese inside. Who knew such a simple change can be so drastic?Aside from the infamous squares, the spumoni is also to die for. Of course, it comes in a bunch of different flavors and the servers are extremely generous with your portions. Always a good thing, if you ask me.As for the actual restaurant, it is top-notch. It's like going to an Italian household. The food is beyond delicious and the atmosphere isn't ""high-class"" or ""formal"". It's very much relaxed and family-like, like a typical Italian household. The prices are slightly steep, but it's a given for any quality Italian restaurant. No complaints.What are you waiting for? Get your ass to Bensonhurst now! A true Brooklyn gem!

If you have been here then you know 7 is prime time and there are a lot of people waiting for a table. Unfortunately, 4 members of my party was traveling from Queens and got caught up traffic, L&B was very apologetic after 20 minutes passed the time and gave away our table. TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. Once we were all together they were still able to seat us at 8pm. It was a family Night out. 6 adults and 6 kids. We ordered a pizza pie and chicken fingers and fries for the kids and the adults feasted on unlimited wine and soda, cocktail and fried shrimp, Some kind of Mozzarella fried thingy, Stuffed Clams and rice balls. We had a HUGE salad, Linguine with clam sauce and penne bolognese, two platters of steak, salmon and Tuna, and Chicken  with mashed potato and broccoli rabe. And if that was not enough it just continues with coffee and a dessert platter with cheesecake, ice-cream and cones with the works. We love the Chef table and our waiter was just fantastic. We travel from queens just for the Chef Table. And also the creamsicle soft serve ice cream ! Sound too good to be true?

When you go there you order a middle or a side or a corner The sides have handles on one side and the corners have handles on two sides. The middle is my preference and has no handle, yet in my opinion it is the best piece. My L&B tip. Only order 2 pcs per person and if you want more wait for a fresh pie to come out, it cost more that way but its worth waiting for a fresh pie. The sauce tends to gather in the middle of the pie and is a little drier on the edges. The crust is always good and the sauce...ohhh the sauce it is the best. I rarely eat the rounds here, but, they are good as well. On the way out don't forget to go next door and get a scoop of the pistachio spumoni, you wont find better than this anywhere.

Maybe because the owners are non Italian. Now they must use tomato paste and they are very cheap with the cheese. They only serve Pepsi soda, no coke cola. Also the slices are very small for the price they charge and you will get heartburn. My advice is to bring some tums if you don't believe me.",11/30/2009,0,25,0,dSo6k_nVWyf1A4gzeEZ9cQ

Most of my pizza was from Pizza Hut, and I was fine with that. When I moved to NYC, I started to hear about Sicilian pizzas, which was something I'd never heard of before. I'm always open to new food, so I when I also heard that L&B Spumoni has the best Sicilian in town, I thought I'd suffer the 1.5 hour subway ride out to Brooklyn to try it.I'm not a fan. I don't think there is anything wrong with the pizza itself, but I just discovered I don't like Sicilians. My ""pizza"" felt like a big chunk of toasted French bread slathered with marinara sauce. Granted, that marinara sauce was tangy and good. But I couldn't even taste the mozzarella that was hidden underneath. Ehh, not a fan. I'm giving it three stars because, really, what the hell do I know about New York pizza?

2959,Lisa K.,0,2,"I spent a lot of time in Brooklyn, and once lived near enough to Spumoni Gardens to eat pizza there a few times a week.   I used to enjoy the food there, so although I now live over an hour away, when my sister requested that we do a family dinner there I was excited.   Last night we ate there with a party of seven including one child and six adults.    I would definitely think twice before I visit this place again.  I had called ahead at 3PM to get seating in the dining room for 5 PM, and was told they don't take reservations, but I could put myself on the dining list which would give us the next available table for our party size.  I was on the list for 5 PM, but we weren't seated until over an hour later!    My family was so hungry that while we were waiting, they opted to sit outside and get a pizza from the take out counter and eat it at the picnic tables outside.   Surprisingly, the take-out counter moved swiftly and efficiently and we were given out pizza and beverages right away.  The pizza was hot and fresh and tasted good.   We had some leftover slices and left them in the boxes to take home.  By the time we could actually be seated in the dining room, my family was ready for desert.  After checking with the hostess, finally, a table was ready.  We were seated, but an older woman helping the hostess was very rude to us and made a nasty comment about bringing in our leftover pizza boxes, even though they were from the Spumoni Garden's take out counter!   She wasn't at all happy to seat us just for desert.  I explained that we had waited over an hour for the table and had one small child and one diabetic person in our party.   I said that my family had drove all the way from Pennsylvania and New Jersey just for this dinner, and that no one could wait over an hour to eat because we all had a long drive home, so that was why we ate outside.   Still, were not treated very nicely.    We were given a table right up against a wall in a cramped corner and a large pile of menus were dumped on top of our pizza boxes by the older woman who was helping the hostess!  The woman explained that ""everyone has a story"", and she ""could not listen to everyone's story"" because the restaurant was too busy.  Still, we were hoping to have a delicious desert and so we waited for the waiter to come take out orders.  We watched the waiter help about 5 other tables before he came to us. Our waiter was nice and polite and apologized for the wait.   My family ordered various sizes of spumoni, tartuffo and tortoni deserts for the adults and an ice cream cone for my niece.  The deserts came out, but a few things were not what we were expecting.  Usually tartuffo has a dark chocolate shell over a mixture of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream, but instead we were served a less enjoyable white chocolate version with raspberry ice cream.  The spumoni was okay, but had a bit of a gritty texture.  The totoni was nice and creamy, but one person in our party complained that the toasted coconut it was topped with was stale and unpleasant.    Overall, our experience in the dining room was not great and I would not return to Spumoni Gardens anytime soon.",5/7/2012,83,16,1,cmXlh0GP2mDncgnIjWzu9Q

2965,Eric K.,0,4,"So my g/f and I are in bay ridge visiting a couple friends who had invited us over for dinner. After eating a monster feast, the conversation topic goes to dessert and our friend implores us to try the spumoni at L&B even though we're stuffed, it's a 10 min drive and it's frigid outside. We trust him and decide to drive out.Thankfully we did. Somehow en route to getting the spumoni ice cream, we were convinced to try a sicilian square slice. at first glance, it looked like one of those pizza truck pizzas that are in midtown. But it was so much better than them. the cheese was actually at the bottom and the tangy, delicious tomato sauce on top of it with sprinkling of pecorino to finish. Together, it formed a slice worth finishing despite my full stomach. Then we tried their eponymous spumoni--i like vanilla, chocolate and pistachio ice creams, and combined together, the taste was predictably good. the spumoni itself wasn't that creamy and it was a little icy, but combined with the pizza, it was worth the short trek.",11/13/2009,62,159,26,YkJ61BgbYEQO2quoU8mcbA

We live on the same block as House of Pizza & Calzone, which also makes the squares, so for him to say this really meant something. Because of his rave review, I decided to venture out there with him to see what all the hype was about. It's not hype! This is definitely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It was tasty, moist on the inside yet crunchy on the bottom. In other words, prefect!

Here's a description of the source of salivation:- a luscious, scrumptious, hearty dough- thin squares of mozz layered in such a way to democratically cover each square slice- a generous slather of sauce that only elevates the flavor with time (get at least a half square if you're gonna be ordering more than 4 slices, just so you can reap the benefits of leftovers later!)- a full sprinkling of parmesan and dousing of olive oil before going in the oven.Upon my first taste, I thought it was good but nothing to rave about.  However, a mere 5 min. later, I couldn't help but help myself to another square.....and then another.....and peoples, the taste only improves when you devour the leftovers the minute you get home because the craving continues to overcome all your senses. this place is a true piece of pizza machinery.  screw Artichoke with their lines out the door.....this place has fresh pizza coming into and out of the ovens; they got pies on deck only to be swiped away minutes later, and in the summer time, the entire indoors of the pizzeria turns into a full-blown pizza manufactury, opening only 1 window awning to walk-up customers.  Despite any sort of crazed bombardment, you can be guaranteed a slice, square, or half a square within 15 min.  practically instant gratification? top notch product delivery?  5 glorious stars.  mmmhmmmmmm.",1/4/2009,337,420,89,M1wl9tWFaDbpfSxh5KmjaQ

But if you live nearby you're missing out if you don't try their pastas, they are fantastic. Last night we split a seafood salad (perfectly cooked but under seasoned) and linguine bolognese (red, not cream sauce, although I've had both). Delicious and unless you're a glutton the famously gigantic portions are perfect to share. Every pasta I've had was perfectly al dente with fresh-tasting sauces in which you clearly taste the love. Pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe is also particularly good, it's not an easy one to get right and they do a slammin job. Service can be brusque and/or just ""meh"" but if you're not in a hurry and want a super authentic Brooklyn Italian experience there's few that will deliver so rewardingly.",8/16/2012,6,51,2,kKn6kPYSKPHpoo29HehdqQ

""It has heavy cream in it,"" she told me. Yeah, heavy cream and CHEESE. And peas?!My food was worse. I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo ($20), which is described as shrimp, mussels and butterfly clams in a spicy marinara sauce. The ""spicy"" marinara sauce was bland; totally under-seasoned. There were big garlic slices in it, but they hadn't been cooked long enough to flavor the sauce. The shrimp was overcooked and there was still grit in my mussels and clams.Even the bread basket was bad.

I think it's because of the vomit smell that remains behind after eating the pizza. It's the cheesy after-smell! So it figures that this is my first time eating a Sicilian .I was brought here by a friend. When she said that we were going to be eating pizza, I was like, damn, pizza. How unexciting. When I go out to eat, I like to eat cultural foods, or Asian influenced foods. I don't see pizza as such. It's the epitome of fast food. You grab a slice and go. Maybe going to one of those fancier pizza joints that they have in the city will change my view of pizza, bumping it up to the ""exciting culinary experience"". That means that I still see pizza as plain old pizza after coming here. But, on the other hand, the pizza was pretty damn good!The pie came out piping hot. I sprinkled tons of red pepper flakes and garlic on it, and took a bite, a delicious bite! I was surprised at how good the slice was. The bread (is that the right pizza terminology for it?) was really soft and pillowy. The sauce was tangy and flavorful. I mean that bite was so awesome! I'm actually craving some right now (craving for pizza almost never happens to me). It really was that good. As for the spumoni, not really.

Full disclosure: I have a sentimental attachment to L&B as my Grandma has always lived around the corner, and a love of the Sicilian pizza from L&B is pretty much genetic for me. To this day, whenever I visit, some squares come back with me. The same goes for the rest of my family. But sentimental attachment doesn't necessarily mean one is wrong, does it? Of course not, glad we agree. Look at some of the other reviews. I'm not alone here. This is the best Sicilian in NYC.It's not your typical slice. Heavy on sauce, light but sufficient with the cheese. The sauce is fantastic, the crust is crispy and buttery, and it's baked perfectly. You can not go wrong.As I tell anyone who's around, or even anyone passing through Brooklyn on the Belt: Go to L&B, get some squares, finish off with some rainbow spumoni, and you'll be enjoying life.",5/6/2010,2,7,0,TH7BgrYrSf4i_lbd033cnw

3002,Susan N.,0,5,"Now this is what a Sicillian slice should be.I've been coming to Spumoni Gardens since I was a kid. Seriously, I think I have a picture of me somewhere of little me on a red tricycle in all of photography's 1980s muted technicolor glory. Back then, I didn't realize that this place was a huge hit. It was always crowded (still is) and the pizza was good. It's old school Brooklyn at its finest (and still is).Since then, I have introduced many a new person to this place, dragging them into the deep bowels of Brooklyn.  Here's what you should know. Stick to the basics - square slices and spumoni. Ok, I don't really know if you should only stick to the basics, as I've never ventured past a slice or two with a spumoni.  But with those so good, how can you try anything else?Personally, I prefer a piece from the middle of the pie without end crusts.  If you prefer the ends or corners, that's ok. Just ask.  The staff understands and has always been great about giving you the slice you want - whether it's a corner piece, a side piece of a middle piece. They will give it to you.  And if they run out, it's not a big deal since the pies come out so fast that you won't end up waiting more than a few minutes.And the spumonis, just wow.  This is the real thing.  You haven't had a spumoni unless you've had one at Spumoni Gardens.",1/2/2009,284,570,24,LVhWEqGNnk8VQI1hw_zV0A

That said, I think this is a place best reserved for New Yorkers who have some kind of magical past with the place. I'm not sure that tourists & thrill seekers would ever want to make the trek. That said, I need to make a trek immediately. It's been too long. Honestly, there's better pizza out there, but there's only one L&B Spumoni Gardens. For some reason everyone refers to their Sicilian slices as  'Square Slices'. Traditionally, I'm not sure how that happened- because nobody seems to call them square anywhere else in NYC,  but it's just the way it is at L&B's.",4/24/2008Previous review,220,153,6,NKichZTe3g5aPIZLU_fnsg

Great place for the kids, it's a common hangout and pleasure to sit and relax with a nice flavored Ice on a hot summer day.If you go on a weekend afternoon, be prepared to wait in long lines, but it's well worth the wait. It's Pizza and more...My only grip is the location is an odd one for those living in the neighborhood (like myself), but it's definitely convenient for anyone taking the subway in. The N train stops a couple blocks away, and the F train is just a few more blocks up 86th St. Not too bad on parking in the area anyway.A popular place for the NYPD, EMT's, and all the locals.

I didn't fall for it at first but it turns out he was right. In Italy nobody orders right off the menu! says Lenny. So I let him plan my dinner and it was amazing. He truly has a love for the art of Italian cuisine and it shows. You just have to stop him at some point or he will keep sending dishes out to you all night. I remember one time where he felt that the dish brought out wasn't up to snuff and he removed it from our check. He also bought us a huge spumoni tower of desert gratis. Sometimes the waiters themselves buy you desert. The portions are gigantic and skillfully prepared. The prices are very reasonable. If you just want pizza remember to stick with the Sicilian. There is none better anywhere! It is a saucy pizza with pastry like crispy dough with an abundance of flavor thanks to love and delicious Brooklyn water. I have been coming here for about 20 years and it has been consistently great. Do not believe the naysayers.

Go grab a pizza pie or a quick dessert. Have to wait long for okay food and not so great service. That's what would make me dock half a star. Not a whole star because the rest of my review will be worth the 5 stars.I LOVE their sicilian pizza! Yes, I know a few people have told me they hate the pizza because there's barely any cheese. Yes, I love cheese too, but this pizza has a distinctive taste, it might be the sauce. Overall, it's always fresh because they always have to cook sicilian pies because that's where everyone goes for.I've had a normal slice here before, it's not anything special. Everyone comes here for the sicilian slices.I also suggest you try their spumoni, it's delicious. I usually get the rainbow spumoni. I actually started off getting italian ices from here. Boy do I regret it because I was missing out on the spumoni and that I can easily get italian ices at ANY pizzeria. Also when I would order from the dessert side, I would see the workers preparing great looking dessert dishes. If I was willing to go back into the restaurant and wait a ton of time for a table and mediocre restaurant service, then I would definitely want to share one of those with someone (they're HUGE!).Fact: Relatives from Long Island come HERE to get a sicilian pie.I can't wait to go back to get a sicilian slice and/or a scoop of their rainbow spumoni!",1/18/2012,2,30,2,3Adi2uAlpGJLT0SZ2Mwuow

3022,Ryan A.,0,5,"There are not many food places that are so good me and the lady need to return to but being that we make at least a bi-monthly trip to this place throughout the year, it's high on our LOVE list.I've been going to L&Bs since I was a little tike and nothing has changed, thankfully. It is -especially in the summer- the book definition of Italian American Brooklyn. Loud crowds of every age group grabbing some squares. Heavy accents all around discussing whatever. Cops coming in grabbing trays for their buddies. Guys on obnoxiously loud motorcycles pulling in to chill for 10 mins or an hour. But most importantly...they make one magical Scilian slice. Crunchy on bottom, fluffy/chewy in the middle, warm blanket of cheese topped with a drowning of sauce. I dunno what it is, but something about these squares is unbelievable, and I don't even like Scilian slices for the most part.I have given the round slices 3 chances throughout the time I've been hitting up L&Bs just to see how it compares. The answer, everytime...bleh. Not good enough to be even on the menu, let alone as a substitute when ordering a square.Some of the cashiers have attitudes but when you're dealing with long lines and tons of people going ""ahhh duuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh yeah, I'll have aaaaaaaaaaaaaa........yo you got change for a 20?"" it'd make me salty too.As noted in other reviews, do not leave this place without finishing up your meal with some rainbow Spumoni. Vanilla, Chocolate and extra tasty Pistachio in a cold and creamy little package. Nothing better to finish up the meal.Some tips for proper L&B Etiquette:1. Don't order a round slice. Ever.2. Ordering a tray or half tray? Go directly to the window on the right and beat the line.3. Don't be greedy...everyone wants the corners or the sides. Deal the hand you're dealt, don't go in there requesting everything but the middle slices.Fun Fact: The restaurant inside?

3042,Lavina D.,0,4,"Def a fan.  I would go back - the area is a bit hard to get to by subway and shady at night, but definitely worth the pizza.  I went for a friend's bday who grew up going to L&B all the time - so that means I got to try a lot of pizza.  I like the round pie more than the square, but I do like the square - and I don't like a lot of square pizzas!  The plain for both was the best.  We initially ordered the round pie with mushrooms and it was just ok.  Then the birthday girl freaked out that we dared to get  topping so we ordered the plain and she was right - 100 times better!  They gave us water glasses for the wine some people ordered which was kind of weird but it was also crazy packed on a Friday night at 8/9pm so I guess I can understand.  They were also really accommodating since we had a lifesize poster of the birthday girl's favorite actor waiting for her at the table as a surprise!",8/11/2011,20,73,0,dZQuto1obEXq4kYNjAwxdA

I don't know a thing about these famous pizza joints that have a following and history of great food but we were all treated great here.  I must admit I was only working an event outside for a few hours doing a promotional event for another company but after we were done they invited us in for lunch since we had been working in the hot sweltering sun. The Pizza while great, could've used a little more sauce but when I mentioned this they brought me a little side cup of sauce marinara to dip my slice into. Also the chicken parmesen I had was delicious. They later brought us their famous Spumoni w/all these flavors, it too was great, the ending highlight of the meal. I try not to eat like this very often but when I want to splurge I'll visit this little place again and also give me a reason to check out Bensonhurst again. I also chatted briefly w/the italian actor Michael Badalucco who was there enjoying some lunch w/his family.

3046,Jonathan J.,0,3,"L&B has been a Brooklyn institution for over 50 years and there's a reason for that. They make quite possibly the best Sicilian squares in all of metropolitan NY. I've been going here since I was a little kid and have always loved my experiences here. Never go here for a regular slice though, they are not the draw. The thick Sicilian squares are fluffy, dripping with amazing sauce and very cheesy. What makes them different is that the cheese is below the sauce which is beyond delicious. If you're looking for the quintessential Bensonhurst atmosphere, this place is it on a summer weekend night. Flocks of club goers and ""Situtation-esque"" Brooklynites flock to this spot to be spotted and to spot. Through the years, this place has been a pizza staple of mine, and will continue to be. I have had some bad experiences though, such as a mouse sighting and I am not a big fan of their restaurant inside. The food is not on par with the pizza they serve.",3/21/2010,650,163,4,i9b5MHqCdg6b6rBA9lrr0A

I guess I'm just one of those people who enjoys their pizza thin and Brooklyn style. I was hoping the pistachio spumoni would be awesome so I got a large size cup but I was disappointed when I tasted it. The flavor seemed too strong, making it seem almost artificial. If it had been more creamy and rich, maybe the flavor would've been more subtle and enjoyable. Anyways, the experience wasn't that bad.

3051,zakk G.,0,4,"From a bike ride along the Belt parkway/Staten Island bridge on a nice Saturday, the girl and I weren't ready to pack up and go home. We were HUNGRY!! There were a few dudes fishing by the bay, and we weren't about to eat Sushi around here, thanks. We are in BROOKLYN! We have to have some Pizza! Am I right!?!?! Yes, I am.We have gone to Franny's, Difara, but.. We wanted a place closer to where we were and asked a few Brooklyn rezzies... One guy said Lenny's, then another heavy set guy interrupts, ""Ey, ho.Wddya born yesterday, hah? L&Bs on 86th, now THAT's a Pizza! Lenny's... D'afugouttaheya~!"" . The first guy reluctantly concurred and I asked the heavy set authority of Pizza for the directions. ""It's far from here, but worth it. It's on 86th after all them Chinese markets and where the train ends.. They gotta sign that says Spumonis. 86street."".. Sir, we aren't from around here, but thanks for the super-local directions. We thanked the semi-scary man and got on Yelp for more juicy details and, more importantly- directions. From where we were, yes. It was quite a bike ride, and realized... They HAVE a parking lot( When do you EVER have a parking lot around NYC!?!?!) My GF, clearly a bit tired from the long/dangerous bike trip AND Hungry as all hell cursed out, ""Oh goddamn it! We coulda drived here!!!"" Knowing she gets a bit... lethal when she is starving, I diverted her attention to the happy groups of people; families, couples, buddies,... entire group of Automechanics... They were all enjoying this... Square pizza... ?.. Not a NY thin slice? Both of us have never tried a square pizza before. No. wait I have. In highschool, when that disgruntled lunch lady used to flop that half cooked, pale squares with dehydrated red sauce and goverment cheese on it.. Yeah. Now that sucked!. My heart sunk a bit, from my childhood trauma. I sure hope that Big guy is right... But then again, the outside seating area is PACKED and they all seem extremely happy. This place can't be that bad.. Can it?We got in line, trying to see the process of ordering. The two guys by the kitchen window basically nods to you, when they are ready to take your order. You state a single slice, or a box. A regular, or the pie. We decided to get one of each.  Sitting down among Local  Brooklynians, we stare at these two rather plain pieces of Pizza. GF went for the square first, while I got the semi-thin crust. ""..OMG..Oh..My GoD!!!"".. !!!!! Are you choking dear? Are you alright!? .. ""This is rediculous!"". Before I could even try a bite, my thoughtful one ate most of it. Her eyes are telling me to go get more. Hey, I haven't even tried my semi-thin slice yet, damn it. .. But since I am P-whipped, I get back on line. I got two single squares this time- fresh out of the oven. Nice! I notice that my slice of pizza is no longer a 'triangle', but more or less a trapezoid with bite marks. "" The slice is ok, nothing special"".. Gee, thanks for the spoiler alert, dear! Now onto the Squares. I already have seen  everyone around me devour this thing... My significant other also swoons about it.. I am the only one that hasn't converted to this idea of a great tasting, thick square pizza. I bite into it, thinking I will get that same sad disappointment hit my palate- just like long ago when I had those horrible Highschool cafeteria squares. I could just imagine in my mind that big guy that told us about this place bragging to his friends at a 'social club'- ""Oh get this. I sent these outtatownahs for pizza today to L&Bs..Hahahaha"". Then something happens. Holy mother of god, what is this!? This is seriously good. The dough is crunchy on the bottom, almost like a mochi-foccaccia center. The sauce is sweet, and yet tangy- a perfect marriage to the loads of Mozz that have melted into the dough. My GF looks at me, ""Ya see!?!? Ya see now!?!?!"" . Yes. I have convereted too. This IS friggn' good. Pizza does not have to be a particular shape or form to be excellent. .. Hey, that would be pizza profiling, or something. But yeah. This is fantastic. How does it compare to other NY institutions? Hard to say. It's like comparing Le Bernardin to Sik Gaek. Ippudo to Zuzu. A Cassoulet that a French Momma made to Meatballs in Sunday Gravy that a Italian grandma made... All great, but just can't compare them the same way.Before we left, we decided to try out the hero sandwiches as well to go. Got the chicken with tons of mozz, balsamic vinegar, sundried tomatoes and olive oil. Absolutely sick! We also got the sausage and pepper one too. That was also a homerun. Seriously, do these guys know how to dish out great food or what!?!? The bikeride back to where we left our car was slow and painful. We were so stuffed! Now if only they had a Hammock somewhere..... hey lets ask that big scary guy again...",10/13/2012,0,19,0,jdaq-J0Ao_0XyUKtshQ_mw

I always remember it being a neighborhood staple, and very friendly. That was not the case at all! We went around 8pm.. and the service was terrible. When we walked in, there was no hostess to sit us for quite a while, so we were standing there. After a good 7 or 8 minutes someone finally sat us down, and than it took another 10 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. We had a table that was in clear view so its not like they over looked us. It was impossible to get out waiters attention, and they were very slow. I was extremely disappointed. The wait staff seemed very nonchalant and not into the customers. The food was mediocre, not like I remembered. The price was cheap, I'm guessing because they now cut back on staff. I wouldn't dine there again, disappointing.",8/9/2013,14,34,7,79Fc7mLk31zZ-lQ6SQS3Ng

3054,Chelsea T.,0,5,"I love this place! When you are craving a square pizza, Spumoni is the place to visit. Of course their other foods like pastas, salads, etc are to die for, my favorites are their squares. The best thing is that there is hardly a wait for their pizza. On the other hand, there is a wait to sit down and eat in their restaurant, but it's worth the wait. Don't get me started on their Spumoni ice! Its like heaven in a cup!  If you ever want to celebrate a birthday in a restaurant, I would recommend celebrating it there. My reason is because they have family sized sundaes that consist of a tower of spumoni and other delicious flavors of ices. If this helps, my Aunt travels from Pennsylvania to get 3 trays of their squares to take home. (I think that should tell you something!) The only down side to this place is that its so good that it is always packed and the restaurant is fairly small.

Unlike some other popular establishments in Brooklyn, we were able to sit down immediately, despite the joint being someone crowded. The pizza was ready in a timely fashion. Now it was time to dig in.The pizza was indeed phenomenal. They have a very specific order of applying the ingredients and creating this pizza, but it works. I do have to admit, I hold Rosa's Pizza in extremely high regard. Going to any other pizza place in the city with talks of it being the best, I wave my Rosa's flag, ready to do battle.

I think buying a pie from them is the same as buying one at a small pizzeria 3 blocks down, they taste the same, I've tried better pizza in Brooklyn then this place.

The thin crust slices are pretty good too. The prices are friendly for both the pizza and the ices! There's usually a lot of foot traffic at this place but I've never had to wait too long to be taken care of at the counter.A really great family place with the outdoor picnic like seating, perfect for nice days!

I've always heard about their pizza and wished to go, and the other night I made it my mission. My friend and I ordered 2 Sicilian slices each and sat outside.  Each slice was $2.50 each, not too bad. It was crowded for a Wednesday, lots of double parked cars, ambulances, and a firetruck (really wouldn't expect anything less than a billion double parked cars in Brooklyn). The pizza was really good and I was amused by the two men manning the window. All business let's go, go go. They were turning out pizza like there's no tomorrow! The only complaint, although it really can't be helped, are the amount of bugs that were flying around outside. It seemed like we were the only two swatting every 3 seconds. Nothing L & B can control, we did sit outside but be forewarned if you're headed on a summer's night. The spumoni?

I spent so many incredible summer nights outside on the patio with my friends & family. We'd all pile into our station wagon (yeah, it's one of those flashbacks) and bum rush the spumoni counter. I love how this is one of the most popular local spots in the borough and their ""parking lot"" can barely fit 4 cars. Anyone else remember the inflatable toys tied to the outer fence?

Then they sprinkle it with olive oil...Half the pleasure was to see them make a pie while I was eating my slice.Personal recommendation: Ask for side pieces.

You can't go wrong with outdoor seating in the warm months and a private parking lot that's free. The cops and firefighters seem to love this place because every time I am here they always have a few of its finest dinning here.

3144,Food Buzzes In The Neighborhood S.,0,4,"It was a crisp fall morning as I make my way North on the Garden state Parkway. As I approach the Outer Bridge Crossing a certain calm falls over me. I am originally from New York but am a transplant here in South Jersey for the last 17 years. You can take the girl out of the city, but not the city out of the girl. Over the bridge and onto 440, then head East on the Staten Island Expressway. As I continue, I can see ahead in the distance the top of the arches of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge towering over the trees. With the sun just about up it is really a sight one should see at least once in a lifetime. When finally reaching the bridge the sun is positioned in such a way that the water beneath is glistening. As I make my way over the Verrazano Bridge, my windows are down, and the crisp clean air is rolling around in the car like a backseat filled with small children laughing. I then exit off onto 92nd Street and automatically make my way to 86th Street to do a little shopping before meeting some friends at Spumoni Gardens for lunch. When I arrived at Spumoni Gardens, I will be honest, I was taken back a little bit by what I had seen. A long building surrounded by a chain link fence which looked like to me a paved parking lot but had umbrella covered picnic tables corralled inside like a bunch of wild horses and trees coming through the sidewalk. There was also a walk up window outside where you can order their famous Spumoni Ice Cream. My first impression, it reminded me of an old carriage house where they used to keep horses. A pretty far cry from what I had envisioned. But once entering the doors I was doubly surprised by what I had seen. A section to the left for Ice Cream, directly in front of you the Pizza take out, then through a door to the right is the dining room with linens on the table. Right off of the dinning room is a huge, newly built Sun room. And yes, that used to be part of the corral of Picnic tables until the crowds had gotten so over whelming to dine in that it was transformed, and transformed beautifully into this solarium type of setting to accommodate more diners. With arches painted on the walls like an Italian Villa and soft music playing in the back round it was perfect.The menu had a wide variety of appetizers and entrees each one sounding better then the next. To start we had decided on the Pear and Walnut Salad. A combination of mixed salad greens and red onion topped with huge slices of Pecorino Romano cheese and Pears, then drizzled with a Balsamic Dressing and topped with candied walnuts. The combination was fresh, crisp and out of this world!! Our entrees consisted of Grilled Balsamic Glazed Chicken topped with Fresh Mozzarella and Red Roasted Peppers, Penne Vodka with Grilled Shrimp and Chicken Marsala. The chicken breast was marinated in balsamic vinegar and grilled until just done and fork tender, mozzarella that melted in your mouth & roasted red peppers that were done so right that you could taste the char on them. The penne pasta was cooked Al Dente and the vodka sauce was light, creamy and smooth with just a hint of vodka to taste and topped with eight large grilled to perfection shrimp, the chicken marsala was two chicken breasts that was obviously cooked in the marsala and mushrooms for just the right amount of time to where it was rich, buttery and like heaven to the palette. A vegetable melody accompanied the chicken marsala consisting of broccoli, zucchini, and baby carrots that were full of color and crisp to the bite. For dessert, of course, we had the Spumoni Ice Cream. The best I have ever had! Chocolate, Pistachio, and Cherry Ice Cream layered with fruit and nuts and a hint of Almond flavoring. There is really no reason to go anywhere else for this specialty. They have mastered it. Which leads me to believe they need to package it so everyone can have a taste. Here in Brooklyn there are all kinds of restaurants that have been in neighborhoods like this one for decades. Standing on old traditions, and homemade recipes from the old country they have lasted through the test of time and the ups and downs of the economy. Spumoni Gardens has been in Brooklyn on 86th Street for more than 70 years. I can understand now that old saying ""never judge a book by its cover"". After being there enjoying the great food and company of friends Spumoni Gardens has Brooklyn written all over it. With the corralled umbrella topped tables sitting on blacktop, the walk up Ice Cream window, the take out pizza and the dining room they have covered it all. So weather you are going for dinner, grabbing a Pizza, or walking up to the window to order Ice Cream . Sit at a table, enjoy the atmosphere, because there is a tree that grows in Brooklyn and it's called Spumoni Gardens",7/7/2011,118,11,4,6LTR5cpTrbMcP9fEIenqGA

There are some inconsistency's with the pizza...one time the cheese to tomato sauce ratio was about 5 to 1 and the other time about 2 to 5. Individual slices can only be ordered plain with cheese which can be a bit annoying sometimes when I crave anything but a plain slice. Their dinner is OK....tasted a bit bland and not much flavor to it. I'd go here again if I didn't have anywhere else to go but I'm not running to get their food if I'm craving really good Italian.",7/7/2014,1,12,1,V8THDqcp5xgEYw70H3pqzQ

3152,Namik G.,0,3,"A friend who is a born & raised Brooklyner brought me to this place one late night. What this place is famous for is their square deep dish sicilian pizza which has sauce on top of mozzarella cheese. The slices go for $2.25 a piece and are sold from a window. I am personally not a big fan of deep dish pizza but I found the sauce (plenty of it) & cheese very flavourful, but could not get over that thick slab of dough. They have regular pizza as well, but if you order it, they'll think something is wrong with you bc square deep dish pizza is what they are known for. There is plenty of outside seating and ppl move around fast. There is also an ice-cream window and a eat in restaurant. To sum it up, too much dough.",3/23/2014,124,234,60,qXidFO36FX1dg27yqQP4ww

3154,Matthew P.,0,3,"If your expectations aren't too high, Spumoni Gardens will likely please. It's a classic red sauce Italian American joint, but being located in the center of classic red sauce Italian American Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, USA, gives it that added touch of authenticity. It's been there since 1939 and for good reason. The food is good, but not great. The portions are insanely huge. Lasagna is my red sauce Italian restaurant litmus test. When they brought it out, there were enough calories on that plate to light a small city. I'm not kidding--I divided it with a knife into quarters, ate one quarter, and will be eating the other three for lunch this week. All for $11.95. And it's good lasagna, with what seems to be quality ingredients. Such a deal! Apps were good. Roasted artichoke was tasty, fried zucchini could use some more flavor, salads are huge and pleasing, calamari was fresh and tender. Spumoni Gardens is famous for pizza, especially Sicilian slices. My verdict: just OK. There's the same or better at most corner pizza joints all around the City. Very heavy on the sauce, light on the cheese here. The deserts are impressive. The spumoni does not disappoint. The pistachio ice cream was chock full of nuts, and very good. The homemade Italian ices reminded me of Corona Ices King over in Queens--highly recommended. Part of the fun of Spumoni Gardens is people watching your fellow patrons. It's like all the extras from the set of the Godfather and the Sopranos in one restaurant. Lots of gold bling, thick Brooklyn accents (which are endearing), friendly salt of the earth service, and some slightly cheezy decor. It's amusing and a fun diversion.",1/15/2014,57,282,136,2xzRuTaCsukEspkWPOul4Q

The line was kinda long but moved really quickly, since there are few options on the menu (a good thing in this case). And since they just crank out pizza, our square slices were warm. We were even lucky enough to find a seat inside.The pizza: excellent. The sauce on top of the square slices is sweet and delicious, and the crust was nice and crisp. The cheese under the sauce was just enough to get noticed, not overwhelming, which is nice. Really an excellent sicilian slice.On the way out we stopped to get spumoni, and it too was delicious. The pistachio had just the right amount of nuts, so we weren't overloaded with them. I will definitely be back for more pizza and spumoni.",6/20/2014,4,89,5,j5TWBPHHMMZWYQj3zhzRTw

Actually their pizza in general just doesn't really do much for me. But I do make the pilgrimage to come here for their Spumoni. It's neither too icy or too creamy. It's just right. There's little chunks of pistaccio in every bite. I don't like things too sweet but they got the sweetness down perfectly. The spumoni is just refreshing and I think they still use the old cash registers too! How cool. Bonus points because they have parking!",5/28/2009,79,313,242,68hPoz5gM72Ewr3Z_bNWUQ

There 2 side to L&B., one side for pizza and one side for everything else like pasta, sandwiches, and dessert. The slice was thick and hot and very juicy but the dough was alot.

My uncles were ranting and raving about this place for months so they finally decided to prove it to me. Mind you, I was very skeptical seeing as everything they raved about before was always overhyped and never met my expectations. Spumoni Gardens definitely met my expectations and then some! The 2 lines (one for slices only and the other for whole pies) were stretched out across the parking lot and now I see why! We got one pizza pie and, at first glance, all I could think of was ""what the hell is with all the sauce?? where's the cheese!?!?!?"" I took one bite and fell in love! OMG I wish I listened to them before and came here all the time so I can get my fill of true Sicilian pizza at least twice a week. The slices are HUGE and extremely filling. I had no idea how I managed to eat 2 slices! My uncle has to be a record breaker though! That guy downed 5 slices! And he wanted to buy more! Nuts! I wanted to puke after the first and I ate the second slice because I just wanted more even though my stomach was screaming ""STOPPPP!!!!""

3175,Laura F.,0,4,"Spumoni Gardens offers indoor and outdoor seating.  Indoor seating is more of a restaurant atmosphere with menu items like pasta and eggplant parm, while outdoor seating is strictly for pizza.  We had heard great things about the pizza, so we decided to order a half tray of pizza - about 12 slices - for $19.  Pizza at Spumoni Gardens is Sicilian style, and their pizza is a little untraditional.  Layered on top of the dough is the cheese, followed by sauce on top. A layer of pecorino romano is then dusted on top of the pie.  We were craving a pepperoni pie and like extra cheese, so we decided to get both as toppings ($2.75 each for toppings).After a 10 minute wait for our pie, we picked it up at the pickup window and sat outside at one of the many picnic tables. The extra cheese looked interesting to me, because a few slices were layered on top.  As you can see in the picture, even with the extra cheese, it looked nothing like a normal pizza.  To be honest, I thought the extra cheese would have been placed on the bottom of the pie, not the top, where the other cheese was originally put.  Still, I'm glad we ordered the extra cheese because I don't know if I would have been able to taste it otherwise.  The sauce was delicious, and I'm not sure if it was the flavoring of the overall pie or the two pieces I had, but I couldn't taste or see the cheese that was cooked under the sauce - maybe because the cheese seeped into the dough. However, I would agree with the host Adam from Man Vs. Food that because there was a layer of cheese in between the sauce and the bread, this pizza was not soggy and the bread remained crisp.With the sprinkling of the pecorino romano on the top of the pizza, my favorite part of the whole pie had to be the crust.  Some excess pecorino got on top of the crust, and it really made the crust so much more enjoyable.I really liked Spumoni Gardens.  Would I spend close to 90 minutes each way on the train for this pizza again? No, but if I was at Coney Island, I'd want to stop at Spumoni Gardens on my way home.",7/5/2011,70,186,18,98cb4OtQ1XkNBCZRs_3LlQ

3188,Mary B.,0,5,"A lot of times when people say a place has the best pizza in New York, you go and you try it yourself and while it might be good, you can't help thinking that there still could be better. Not this. This lives up to all that hype.A typical Sicilian slice tends to have that Cap'n Crunch effect--the crust is so sharp and crumbly that it fucks up the roof of your mouth. The L&B slice is nothing like that. The crust is crisp on the bottom, chewy in the middle, and then the sauce-cheese-sauce thing will kill you. The sauce is perfect, just sweet enough, just rich enough. I always love a side or corner piece, but especially here, where that crust edge is flecked with Parmesan cheese that's gotten slightly burnt in the oven. Oh man! When you pull up in the parking lot, the smell is the first thing to get your mouth watering, and you won't leave thinking there is anything better out there.",7/26/2011Previous review,10,94,14,bOiS34UfyX9cbTePKxSzJg

Let me just say that the sauce is to die for, and the pizza itself is moist and delicious. It is really tough to articulate how amazing the pizza at L&B is; instead, just buy a slice... actually, buy a pie. It's what you'll end up wanting anyway!

She and I went Wednesday (2/13) and we were very unhappy with the food in the restaurant and the service. The servers couldn't be bothered and the guy who brought out our food practically threw it on the table. We got the fried calamari, veal sorrento, and eggplant rollatini.  All were VERY bland. We could have been eating anything. The pasta that came with the mains was very watery and all the food was super oily. I've raved about this place in the past but it has been going downhill the last few years. I've heard the pizza is still good, but with so many good options in NYC I don't think I'll be back for the restaurant.",4/20/2012,0,22,0,KU6z6YSuAeTMJqnKrOWETA
3196,Helya M.,0,5,"After an hour and a half on the train, I arrive to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.  I step off the train only to find myself in an unfamiliar territory. It was everything you would have imagined. Tree lined streets, cozy neighborhood homes, and no sound of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan for miles. As I approached this pizzeria paradise I couldn't help but feel like a little girl again. I immediately joined the long line of Brooklynites in anticipation. I could have ordered everything on the menu. But I came with a purpose and that purpose was called the ""Sicilian"". I ordered the Sicilian pie (square) 12 slices but if I could have done it all over again I would have opted for the 24 slice.  It was a beautiful sunny day so I sat outside, although there is inside eating as well. I opened the box and immediately grabbed a corner slice. The crust was crisp and slightly burned on the edges. The bread was exquisitely soft and not too chewy.It almost felt airy. The mozzarella was perfectly melted and topped with the sweet red sauce and parmesan.  The mix of flavors and textures were unforgettable. I knew I had to save room for the namesake of this food landmark. My next treat was called the Spumoni. This molded Italian ice cream was layered with different colors and flavors (chocolate,vanilla, and pistachio).  It was a good blend of ice and cream you could say. Good thing I was sitting outdoors because this delectable treat practically melts in your hand. All in all my field trip was a success. Would I do it again?

It's among the 15 best pies in the Tri-State, if not America. The square is the one to get here, unique with plentiful supplies of sauce and the perfect amount of cheese. This is completely different from anything you have tasted before, anywhere. You can easily finish off 4-5 square slices here, it's just that good. L & B uses top of the line ingredients, and you'll know it as soon as you taste it.The dessert here also wins, ices, ice cream, or the spumoni, it's all a win, and very good.

The best word for it is OVERRATED. My experience there was horrible. I went for pizza a few months ago (restaurant/dining room and pizzeria are separated sections). Pizza was very bland, nothing special, and I can easily say that most other pizza shops in the neighborhood have better pizzas than L&B's. So although it was not super terrible, it was not even average or good.Now, my restaurant experience yesterday was TERRIBLE. We left before we even ordered food. We, a family of 3, showed up at 7:30pm. The dining room was busy, but not super busy - there were still a few empty tables. We sat down and were provided menus. We waited and waited for someone to come and give us some water and ask us about our order. Noone was coming to our table. A few times I waived my hand to no avail. After more than 20 minutes, the hostess noticed I was trying to catch her attention and came to our table. I politely mentioned to her that we've waited for a very long time and are very thirsty and would like some water. She said with a huge attitude: ""Well, did you ask for water?"". I said ""No, because noone came to our table yet"". She then said, ""well, we don't bring water until you actually place an order. "" When I mentioned that we have been ready to place our food order for quite awhile but noone has come to serve us - she said - we'll can't you see we're busy and stormed off. We gathered our stuff and left. When I mentioned to the hostess at the door ""thank you for such great service"" (being sarcastic, of course""...she answered back ""You're welcome"" - instead of at least saying sorry!

I ate chicken franchisee and had them add artichokes. It was amazing. Don't go on weekends because it is too crowded.

Wait a couple minutes and you can have a fresh pie just for you. Definitely one of the better pizzas you can get and if I didn't live pretty much next to Umberto's I'm sure I'd venture out to Spumoni's on the regular. Be warned though, what with the extra crust and all this pizza will fill you up quick. 4 slices and I'm done. 5 and I'm liable to pass out.",9/24/2009Previous review,8,37,3,obeeT82HPjsJkwx2S0rvuA

Ive only eaten in the dining room a couple of times and the service kind of sucks every time.

The key piece to their pizza pie is the fact that they put a thick layer of cheese-y goodness between the tomato sauce and the bread, thereby making the bread taste cheesey. the extra cheese on top only makes it more wonderful. if you've never attempted a trip to Spumoni Gardens, it's well worth the effort.

I was not disappointed. Sauce was savory and flavory. The cheese formed the perfect union and the crust was crispy and delightful. Had 2 slices (to make sure) and sat amongst the locals and the tourists. As previous reviewers stated, the clientele is mixed with on-duty cops and locals on date-night.  Didn't try the spumoni after my meal but will try next time. BTW, while on 86th Street you can go 10 minutes in any direction and discover more of Brooklyn if you're a tourist.

The delivery guys snarkily replied that we were lucky he had another pizza in the car. Another time, the delivery guy showed up with only one of 5 pizzas we ordered for a party.

That being said, when I was here, I was obliged to get it (when in Rome...). I was NOT disappointed. This was probably the best Sicillian slice I've ever had. I wish though they had more shakers of cheese and chili pepper floating around the premises. We had to go borrow some from our neighboring tables.",8/22/2010,52,88,50,8WGBw2O0h0B-NOVzcrn7HA

It wasn't better than some of my favorite Sicilian red slices in CG and the new Dona Bella in Tribeca, but it was equal. And the fact that it has really nice, clean outdoor seating and spumoni makes it special. I would return for another square slice and a cone of the coconut, watermelon, or vanilla chip spumoni.I also am excited to try Joe's and some of the other slices in Gravesend.",7/2/2010,0,70,7,WA5-mnGtSxW1yVRwKoZ5zA

I love seeing the same waiters, chefs, and hosts year after year. Another great aspect of Spumoni Gardens is they have different spaces to accommodate various moods and occasions- you can show up with the whole Little League team at the picnic tables outside or dine at an intimate table for two in the dining room.

Ok....we go on to order some broccoli in oil and garlic, calamari and of course the pie. First, the broccoli was simply amazing, extraordinary to be exact..not oily, perfect amount of garlic and the broccoli had a nice crunch. Next, the calamari was decent at best. Light and airy but too chewy for my liking...Finally, after waiting what seemed like forever, the pizza! We ordered half sausage, half extra cheese. Their sausage is great, thinly sliced, very flavorful. The pizza on the other hand was SUCH a let down. It was over powered with so much romano cheese that it made the slice just wayyyy too sweet! I'm not a fan of sugary sauces/pizza although some really enjoy it. I will say the Spumoni is out of this world though!To make a long story short, not impressed at all in regard to the sicilian. Spumoni and broccoli off the charts and the service could use a ton of improvement. It pains me to see how many people obsess over this place because there are sooo many more local joints throughout the city that deserve so much more credit than this place.

Not too comfortable sitting outdoors but love the delivery service of the place (years back).  Best, Freshest Pizza, right out of the oven. It's not far from Avenue U in Brooklyn, near 86 street. Outdoor tables are plentiful and the crowds are even more plentiful. Though they have other foods, I've tried only the pizza and the pizza with black olives topping.  Both were totally excellent.  And the delivery service is fairly reasonable and quick.Their pizza is great, very close to best IN Brooklyn.  Location is not great.  This place is directly across from the large projects . And in the past we have read, in the news, of many violent acts in those projects.  During one incident, even a police officer was attacked in the projects.  We prefer this place for take-out rather than for eating in at night.

I hear the spumoni is excellent but heard that after I went so haven't gotten the chance to go back. The plain slice was good - nothing super special - but definitely a good slice. The Sicilian though, I'm not a fan. I saw this on Man V. Food and was very excited to try it - but I was pretty disappointed. I saw on the show that the cheese went straight on the dough but I wasn't prepared for what that meant. It was like a cheese bread with a heavy slathering of diced tomatoes on top - sprinkled with some grated cheese (seemed like parmesan but I don't think it was). Anyway, I absolutely love pizza and love Sicilian but did not love this pizza. I give it four stars for the plain slice and 2 stars for the Sicilian.

3308,Olga T.,0,5,"By far one of the best pizzarias in Brooklyn. This place will always hold a special place in my heart because I grew up coming here with my family, whether to grab a slice or treat myself to some spumoni ices. The place is always packed in the summertime, but that doesn't mean that there's a long wait for your food. There is a huge amount of outdoor seating so you won't have any problems finding a seat. I have never eaten at the neighboring restaurant, but I've heard that the food there is amazing as well.",2/23/2010,287,591,15,oID4QGAu8v1mQfKOSEt_Bg

3310,Bilal E.,0,5,this place by far had the best pizza ive ever had. i got two squares and when i was done immediately went over and bought two more. they take card even on small orders which is a plus because most pizza places dont even take card in the first place. the dough they use is so delicious. this is my new favorite spot and i go there every week or so now!,7/6/2013,0,7,0,vA60c3o2HLC-mzzslU3GaA
3311,Zaheerica A.,0,5,"I don't know the anatomy of Sicilian pizza or why the tomato sauce is over the cheese... but it is probably the reason L&B's square pizza one of the best things my tongue has ever had the pleasure of tasting. The moment I bite into a hot slice, I can feel the goosebumps rising from the surface of my skin. (Warning: This might get a little graphic.) When I take a bite, my teeth descend into a thick, soft pillow of cheese and bread--a delightful distinctness that separates this pizza from all the other pizza joints that serve them hard, dry, and tasteless. After passing that deep layer, I meet the crispy crust. The crust gives the pizza that nice contrast in hardness... for lack of a better word. OH! Now lets talk about the sauce! Getting past that initial bite and then moving on to chewing... it's no wonder why this pizza is so famous. The tomato sauce is honestly the best part with it's fresh, sweet, and slightly tangy sauciness... All in all, L&B is a great place to go to for lunch, dinner, and even dates. Some other things I thought I should mention are that the spumoni (ice cream) itself is actually very good too, the wait to get into the restaurant isn't that bad, the service is great, there isn't much of a wait for your food, the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice (it kind of has that date night feel with the mirrored ceilings and dim lighting, if ya know what I mean), and lastly the bill isn't going to leave your wallet feeling empty.

They layer the pizza - dough then cheese then sauce on top.  It is life-altering and you will always have one more then you intended.  Finish up with some spumoni ( Vanilla, chocolate and pistachio italian ice with slices of almonds ) and you will be satisfied every time.

3314,Gary S.,0,1,"We ate in the restaurant last night. The kids wanted salads and pizza.  I wanted to have fish.   The hostess seated us. We waited at least 20 minutes for the waiter. When he came to take our drink order other diners at other tables were calling him over to see where their dinners, salads and appetizers were. I immediately saw that this guy was having a major problem. A bus boy brought over the drinks. My Dad asked for more ice. It took 2 reminders with the bus boy to get the ice. The bus boy then brought out the salads. He had no idea who ordered what. Since we were sharing salads we asked for plates. That took another few minutes for something simple.Then they brought out dinner and almost left the salad dishes on the table. I had to ask him to take them away. I had asked the waiter to tell me how the Tuna was prepared. He said grilled with lemon and spices. The tuna came in 3 thin pieces. Did not look fresh or appetizing. The fish was swimming in some mushroom and butter sauce. I was pissed. The kids both ordered Sicilian Pizza, it was not hot, but they ate it anyway. We love their pizza and will skip the restaurant next time. Big disappointment.",5/11/2012,27,15,0,2bHtfC_F_9XvJQHZETbkyQ
3315,Baby S.,0,2,"OK but nothing over the top impressive.  Crowded on Sat night, the outside tables do not get clean on a regular basis due to the huge turnover of people, the regular pizza is nothing to rave about, not better than I had elsewhere, the Italian ices are pretty good, though.  The portions are huge, but I did not enjoy my Caesar salad-it was a huge container of lettuce drenched with a heavy Caesar dressing and they gave me 5 chicken cutlets on a side that I had to cut myself, I would have preferred a lighter dressing, less chicken, cut up and mixed well, ended up not eating like 80% of it.  The biggest turn-off though was the bathrooms, you have to walk all the way to the back of the restaurant where the kitchen is, there is one bathroom per gender, and the walk to it is not pretty as you see and smell all the garbage, maybe that decreased my usually healthy appetite.  I love Italian food and am always a sucker for a good slice of pizza, but I can't see coming back here.",6/10/2014,0,717,0,jarQAt1wP2CaYkrQKKOHRA

The cheese is nice and toasty/gooey, the sauce has a mild sweetness to it, the crust tastes like freshly baked focaccia bread.. You think you don't ilke Scilian pizza.. think again. This is in a class by itself. The fact that they put the cheese on the bottom and then just sprinkle a light coat of tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesean on top gives this pizza an incredible taste and consistency.

Good food, horrible service both times.  Yes, the pizza is very good.  Tasty, soft crust, a rich, almost sweet sauce.  Many could learn from this place.But it's best to get your pizza to go.  Here is what you could expect if you eat in.A 40 minute wait as they don't take reservations unless you have the pre-fix menuAfter you've waited for that long, no one will care if you might be thirsty as neither you waiter or busboy will come around for 5-10 minutes to pour water. Best to order everything at once.  Waiter seems nice, but when he brought the food, as soon as the food was on the table, he darted away.  Didn't ask us if we needed anything (we did), if the order looked correct (he forgot something).   So, with not even the condiments you'd find at an ordinary pizzeria, we eat our appetizers.  We finally tried to get the attention of some of the busboys who seemed confused, understandably, because it's not their job.  We eventually flagged down another waitress asking her to call our waiter.

3324,Nicolas D.,0,5,"Listen, this is more than just pizza, this is an experience. You don't go to L&B for a slice and a coke. You go for a couple of squares and some spumoni. Don't bother with the restaurant as that is there just as an angle to make more money. Their Italian food is mediocre at best. It's the squares you are after and should be most concerned with. And by squares, I am referring to their pizza. Call it anything else and you WILL be ignored. Asking for a  Sicilian instead of a square has just proved to all around you that you are NOT a local, probably a yuppie from north Brooklyn or, even worse, Manhattan, and you are 10 seconds away from getting rolled.You go up to the counter and tell the guy how many squares you want and how many pepsi's. No, they don't serve coke. Don't ask. You can also order half a tray (12 squares) or a full tray (24 squares). Feel free to take some home, they keep well for a couple days ONLY if you re-heat in an oven. If you use a microwave, you are an asshole. If you order a ""slice"", you are an asshole. If you try to order a pie, you are an asshole about to get rolled.The square, when properly prepared will have a thick crispy crust and will be drowned in their old school sauce. Underneath the sauce you will find most of their fresh cheese, with a little on top for good measure. It looks like a regular Sicilian. It's not. Most cheese on a Sicilian sits on top, like a regular slice. This is one of their hooks, along with the sauce, which you will NOT find anywhere else on the planet. Sit down and enjoy. Do a little people watching. You will quickly realize you are in a part of Brooklyn surrounded by real Brooklyn locals, with a smattering of Staten Island. You got your guineas, your mick's, your russian mobsters, gangsters and wannabe's from the nearby projects all in one place enjoying some of the best pizza in NYC. Keep your mouth shut unless you know what's good for you. These locals can smell fear and weakness from miles away, and you will be fuc*ed.When you are done with your squares, walk up to the Spumoni counter and get a couple scoops of the real deal. This is mothers milk to us Italians growing up in that neighborhood. Try it once at least. You don't have to love it, just give it a shot. They have normal ice cream for the yuppies as well.Done with the spumoni? Great, now get the fu*k out of the neighborhood while you can still walk.",12/22/2009,5,9,0,gCbtxeiq6ADcaYX10fnrfQ

I wouldn't want it all the time but it's nice for a change.   Good pastas, heroes and salads. Reasonable prices.  Best part is eating in their outdoor (concrete) garden on picturesque 86th Street.  As you can imagine, Gravesend isn't exactly brimming with trendy sidewalk cafes, so this is the place to be in nice weather.",7/27/2012,4,133,6,J2bQNhAlmNfd-_JxddaHmw

This place is still a legendary Brooklyn place... They are known for their squares but the round slice is real nice too.... Most of the servers have a personality of a wet noodle( not all though) but the place is still good... The restaurant area of the place can be a rip off though...

While you are waiting for your food they leave you with the best breads! The raisin one (the best) of which I swear I'll go out and buy for myself every time. The wait staff is great, great personalities, quick and friendly service. Now, if you're not in the mood to sit down, the pizzeria offers the best squares. They're very saucy with minimal cheese. AND of course, how could I forget to mention the Spumoni! Don't end a night at L&B Spumoni Gardens without having Spumoni!

Go up to the counter and ask for a certain number of squares meaning sicilian slices and move to the side. One of the great things about this pizza is the fact that it is always fresh and right out of the oven. Bottom line is they have been doing this pizza the same way for over 50 years don't ask for toppings or regular slices get a couple of squares and a pepsi and save room for the spumoni.

You see cars double parked everywhere just to grab a slice. And the other 1 1/2 is taken away for the horrible pasta served in the restaurant. Sorry, but even I can make better pasta.

Even when the line is long, it won't take long for you to get your food. The spumoni and ices are also incredibly good. BUT there is one major issue here. The LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM. They just scream into it all day. Its unnecessarily loud. I would easily say they deserve 4 stars otherwise, but it is so distracting, and in some cases, if you sit too close to a speaker, painful to endure, that it ruins everything else this place has going for it.

3411,Lauren S.,0,4,"I actually sat down in the dining room here for the first time when I went on a date with a new beau (I still heart him) last Fall. We had a lovely, romantic, no-frills Sicilian-American style experience. Some may consider an atmosphere like Spumoni Gardens to be cheesy/borderline Jersey Shore in class factor. But that is exactly why I love it! Very old school, colorful, and not trying to be trendy. It is what it is. But it's kind of staple. I just love old neighborhood institutions like this - these kind of neighborhood family ethnic eateries require lots of effort to keep alive in a day where it's all about having it your way or being ultra trendy-hipster. I respect their ability to survive, stay basic, and stay kind of old skool no matter how kitschy (or any other descriptive term that may come to mind....I don't want to get too mean with the jokes) they are! Spumoni Gardens is classic and very colorful with all of the personality abound inside & out. It's a nice slice of the neighborhood. Going here for a date was awesome because the ambiance made me feel like we were actually living the movie ""My Cousin Vinny"" by choosing this place as a date destination to be all mushy & cutesy. The people dining around us were very entertaining, and kind of distracting - we kept speculating as to who was ""made"", who you wouldn't want to fuck with, whether any hits were ever made in this place, etc. The large tables of boisterous Bensonhurst families and their thick accents are part of the experience here.  Loved it.Oh yeah, the food. I've always waited a year for takeout in the past (I usually get entrees or sandwiches - I don't like their sicilian pizza - sorry to say), but sitting down in the dining room is different. The owner or manager is really really into making guests feel like family, and does little extra stuff for people to make them feel good & because he needs a lot of attention. You get huge portions. We doggy-bagged the leftovers, and that's a big deal for me to do. I would describe the food as a step up from very good pizza parlour entrees. It's more about the ambiance and whether you're in the mood for the style.",1/16/2010,168,141,77,kmuZJhe2UERaTtIm44Z9Ow

Squares are all I get and probably the only pizza you should get here. Who gets the regular slice here anyway? You can watch the pies being made - sliced cheese (not grated!) under the sauce with a sprinkling of more cheese on top. I can't even describe in words how good their squares taste, you gotta try it for yourself! It's seriously a bite of heaven. Before you go, you also have to get some spumoni.

Of course, they only have a restaurant right next door to the pizzeria; but personally, I'd have to say they're known for that pies, and square pies at that.

3437,Peter F.,0,2,"I lived in brooklyn my whole life (31 years) ive been to hundreds of parlors in nyc and to say this is ""da Bess""(mind you, im italian) is naive. The regular slices here are ordinary slices and take a back seat to a bunch of places. The grandpa pizza(that's what people from brooklyn who had homemade pizza call it) is good but is far from out of this world. Again, with the amount of parlors in nyc, its ignorant to say this is the best. Period.  The staff are a bunch of idiots that need a slap back into reality. They have egos because of their reputation and dont realize they make pizzas for a living. Personal story, it was the middle of may and it was about 50 degrees out. My two friends ordered pizza and asked if they could eat it inside because it was cold. They were instantly met with attitude and eventually were granted access to the holy frail of pizza parlors. As we were inside I decided I would get a slice. I approached the counter to order, the old miserable man told me I had to go back outside and order. I said ""I have to go to the back, go outside and go all the way around, order pizza and go all the way back inside?"" His response ""yeah"". so I agreed and did what he said. I sit back down took one bite, spit it on the floor, threw it at the garbage, purposely missed and left. Spumoni gardens, your pizza isnt that good that you think you can treat people however you please. Sorry we didnt feel like eating pizza outside in cold weather.

This place is historic and is basically 3 different businesses crammed into one place. If you're rocking an Amar'e Stoudemire jersey and just wanna stop by for a slice there is a window outside where you can sit and chill out after a day of fishing or something. And you just have to order one of their square slices and you'll feel like everything in the world is in order. Or you can go to another window and get some spumoni. For the non-Italians spumoni is like a cross between ice cream and an Italian ice, it's SPUMONI! I dined inside with my tiny ol' grandma though. Had the sea food salad, and a bunch of other awesome stuff. If you're a New Yorker this place is great because you can be as loud and as obnoxious as you like.

Might I add many sounded like fish-tales, but in the end, even they couldn't live up to how great it was. In true New York fashion they have a walk-up window (don't sit inside, its no the same) and you order the same thing every time. And that order....is pure heaven. They make a Sicilian Pizza that knocks your socks off, fills you up and keeps your wallet full in the mean time. But don't miss out on desert either. There Spumoni for desert is out of this world. Of course it is, they're known for it. It's tradition, nostalgia and a gastronomic adventure all wrapped into one. To get the full effect, you've really got to order from the outside window and hope to get a seat at one of the many benches. The only reason it doesn't get that fifth star is due to the massive crowds and even though they have a ton of benches and tables, its hard to find a spot.

I go for their sicilian! Oh my god. Whenever I go here I have to resist myself from devouring more than 2 slices. I cannot begin to explain to you the awesomeness in this little 4x4inches of heaven. Let me start with the crust. The crust is sooooo soft, not chewy, and has a crunch on the bottom. Some people say it tastes undercooked, but its not! They are probably talking about the cheese that is perfectly melted on top of the dough that literally fuses together and makes the dough extra soft and melty. Then comes the tangy sauce splattered on top of the cheese. I did not know that a bread, tomato, and cheese could taste so good together. Believe the hype! I live in Queens and I haul myself to Brooklyn ever now and then just for their sicilian slices. I've always wanted to try their regular slices too but I could never get myself to get one because I can never risk wasting a space in my stomach when I know there can be a sicilian in there instead.",6/2/2011,118,14,20,8gJJ9fRkyDlveKqUf5ed2A

The cheese under the sauce is perfect for someone like me that doesn't like overly cheesy pizza, and their sauce is tangy and delicious. It's honestly the perfect slice. Again, there's no reason to elaborate because for what it is (a pizza place) it's perfect. It looks like a pizza place, smells like a pizza place, and has service like a pizza place. I've never eaten in the restaurant side of it, but if their other food is anything like their pizza then it's divine!",2/8/2011,262,242,88,SFNTctsiX4EABPfuk9xB7Q

3464,Jordan M.,0,5,"L & B Spumoni Gardens is a treasured Brooklyn institution, a piece of my childhood, and without a doubt purveyors of the best square slice of pizza on the planet (although L & B calls it a Sicilian). The square slice is the one of the best known signature foods at L & B; the way it's prepared is unlike any other square slice you've ever experienced. And then of course is the spumoni. I suppose people are more aware of gelato as the frozen Italian treat, but if you've ever had spumoni you'd be a fan. And if you've ever had exceptional spumoni, you've had it at L & B or from L & B. They don't call it ""Spumoni Gardens"" for nothing.  The service is nice and they prepare some nice pasta dishes and a pretty good chicken parmigiana too. But if it's atmosphere you're looking for, the L & B Spumoni Gardens is probably not your first choice. They have a restaurant, but it is a bit shabby, and most of their seating is outdoors on picnic tables. You should probably have them deliver a Sicilian pie, and a spumoni cake for dessert. You will not be disappointed.Overall I'm rating the food. They have a decent round slice too, but it's the spumoni dessert and the Sicilian slices are as good as you'll ever have it.",9/10/2008,13,1,0,vKOdFgftTCgDz9eMfF_YLA
3465,John P.,0,2,"A 4 for the squares, A zero for their regular pie. How they can make a good square slice and then completely ruin a regular slice is beyond me. Their regular slice has a drop of sauce with cheese and the dough is way too soft. I guess they use up all of the sauce on the squares...So only go here if you want a square (sicilian for you transplants) but never ever order a regular slice or pie. You'll get bad taste, immediate heartburn and the runs the next day. You might also want to avoid actually going into the pizzeria part of this establishment.

3487,Jacinda S.,0,4,"Spumoni Gardens has been a mainstay for decades. So here's the deal: The restaurant is on the far right. The food, eh. very so-so. In the mid-right is where you can basically order anything from the restaurant to-go. mid-left is spumoni, ice cream and Italian ices. For those of you unfamiliar with what spumoni is, it's chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio - and YES, pistachio is a nut to the other reviewer who complained about picking nuts out of the ""green part"". If you don't like any of those flavors, don't order it and don't complain if you do (it's like ordering sushi and complaining that there was seaweed in it). The spumoni and other flavor ices are good...not the best you'll get in NYC, but it'll definitely hit the spot on a hot day. And last but not least, on the far-left is the pizzeria - and that is where all the stars go. If you don't like Sicilian style pizza, don't eat here, the regular slices are not very good. Where they shine is in those delicious ""squares"". Crispy on the bottom, fluffy in the middle, and doughy on the top, right where it touches those thin slices of delicate mozzarella. it's then covered in a sweet tomato sauce and topped with parmesan. These are the best Sicilian slices you'll find anywhere on the East Coast. I won't get into the fight over which is better: corner, side or middle - it's all good. In my opinion though, you shouldn't deduct stars if you don't like deep-dish or Sicilian style pizza, that's what this place serves and they serve it well.",7/1/2008Previous review,50,120,2,Uj9g9VRLQLDOh7B-Hc2MBA
3488,Barbara B.,0,5,"Best Pizza on earth and more!  Have eaten outside on their tables many times in the summer.  As the years go by the food stays the same delicious.  I have had probably everything on the menu.  My favorite is naturally the pizza but I love the spumoni and pasta as well.  You can not leave without consuming at least two slices of heaven.  The crust is crisp delectable, cheese fresh probably homemade if not it sure taste like it.  I wish I had the recipe for the sauce/gravy yummmm!!  The staff is friendly and know how to handle a crowd of hungry people because it can get crowded.  I have since moved out of Brooklyn, but when I do get the lucky chance to stop by I will make sure I bring a couple of pies and calzones home because I can freeze the goodies and the delectables do not loose the flavor. I once took home 5 pies froze each slice and was in heaven for months.  If you are in the area and looking for an excellent pizza palor (as we used to call them) do not pass this place I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1/4/2010,19,10,0,VRS-Ns_so31asmaEfeQiAg

I remember once when we ate in and placed our orders and waited for seriously all of 10-15 minutes (considered normal for the busy weekends) for our calamari appetizer and the boss lady herself came by our table to apologize saying that the kitchen missed our order because it was so busy. We hardly even noticed! Our waiter then came out like a minute later with a meat and rotini appetizer ON THE HOUSE as an apology for making us wait. That's awesome service there!  I haven't been around the area for a while now but all the times I've gone in the past, the food and company was always great and I just love the atmosphere.

Try their argula salad, you will thank me. My husband always orders the eggplan parm and I swear it tastes like my grandmother's and hers was the best. You can sit outside at the picnic tables and order from the windows or go inside the restaurant out of the elements. If you are feeling incredibly indulgent get the tartufo supreme.

3504,Scheid I.,0,3,"After reading about this place on the Dyker Heights Christmas Lights facebook page, we decided to give it a try last night.  First it is not in the Dyker Heights neighborhood as we drove a good many blocks to get to it.  No parking  in lot, but did get street parking. Went in to crowded waiting area where they continually wheel large garbage cans through on hand trucks. Spoke to woman in charge and asked if they could accomodate our 80 year old mother who has celiac disease and they said yes, just to speak to the waiter. Told us there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. So we waited - more like 40 minutes, but were seated.  Waiter took our order.  Very quickly delivered the sicilian pie for the five of us and pitcher of sprite. But we waited and waited. Finally kids ate the pizza and still no grilled chicken for my Mom. A busboy finally came and asked if everything was ok - we said no, still waiting for grilled chicken. Waited some more and waiter finally appeared. He went to check and said chicken was still on grill and quickly left. Waited some more. Finally got up and went to get woman in charge. Lo and behold the chicken appeared.  Now our pizza was ice cold and the chicken was only luke warm. Bus boy began clearing table moments after chicken was finally delivered.  Not one person apologized for long -long delay for a simple piece of grilled chicken served on a bed of lettuce and tomato.  $40 for 6 of us to have dinner seemed reasonable, but service left a lot to be desired.",12/31/2012,1,8,0,4qIg7wMW9OLo_kCxpokSkw
3505,Maryanne N.,0,5,"This is about as Brooklyn as you can get! I mean...we're talking the real Brooklyn Italian experience here.  You can either grab a slice from the pizza line and sit outside on warm summer nights, or stop at the hot food counter and get some calamari and a hero for your picnicing pleasure. But the true experience comes in the dining room. Portions enough to feed a family of four (and thats just on the appetizers) and prices reasonable enough to keep you coming back again and again.  I highly highly reccomend the pear salad.  Microgreens, fresh pears, candied walnuts and your choice of cheese (go with the ricotta salata)! Order with the intent to share. That pasta bowl probably has a full pound of pasta in there.  Chicken or Veal Parmigianna? Yeah baby! Be prepared for leftovers! Or you can do what my family loves to do. Go in and get a salad (pear or orange, or an order of mussles...or fried calamari or....) and then get a pizza at your table.  Fresh and hot from the oven, thin crust, good quality mozzerella and tomatoes... And of course your meal won't be complete without a lemon ice or (of course) a Spumoni that they make right there at the resturant. Spumoni Gardens is a true Brooklyn institution.

3510,Brian G.,0,4,"Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  My friends from NYC always said that they had the best pizza.  I always brushed it off, but now I know that they are right.  Great outdoor seating.  Good Italian ice too.",9/8/2011,3,22,0,mYQrbk1dweIW4dQ5CAGWQg

3515,Ian C.,0,5,"One of the best Italian meals I've ever had came from this place. I went with my uncle and his side of his family to celebrate his brother's birthday.  So, there was like 10 of us and we waited a pretty long time to get seated.  We made the mistake of 1) not making reservations on a Sunday afternoon and 2) we didn't expect there to be another big group.  But the wait was worth it.  For appetizers, we got the fried calamari, baked clams, and the rice balls.  The calamari was extremely tender and fried to perfection.  The baked clams- if i didn't have to share with the rest of the table, I would have eaten all of them.  The rice balls-- not quite what i expected for a rice ball, but it was still really good.  For the main course, I had their eggplant baked with ziti and mozzarella. The plate was huge!  My cousin ordered their famous sicilian slice- he enjoyed it.  And around the table, everybody got pastas or veal parm... everything smelled, looked, and i'm sure, tasted very good.  And for dessert- yes, there was room... we got their italian ices- it's like gelato, but more icy and it's got different layers of flavors.  I'm not really a big dessert person, but I have to say this was a really good end to the meal.",2/12/2010,54,386,3,-zkb7-Tu9Q_0OAu1dVgmyA
3516,Charles S.,0,3,"i could never understand  what the big deal was about the pizza in this place.have been there a quite a number of times over the years,mostly for the spumoni and other flavor ices ,the outdoor seating and because my wife loves the squares,but frankly i always get the runs when i eat there.there is  way to much sauce and not enough crisp for my taste. and with the unfriendly workers behind the counter speaking either spanish and some  arabic language, in a so called  italian joint,itjust sucks the pleasure out of eating here.",3/1/2009,0,5,0,EBrSDQjka_gPVHU1SG6GoA
3517,S B.,0,4,"I've heard a lot about this place for a while so I made a special trip from LI to try their pizza. I was impressed as expected. The atmosphere is pretty cool with a pretty large outdoor eating area. As far as the pizza, the sauce was very good, it had a nice fresh tomato flavor and lots of fresh oregano and spices. I love Sicilian style pizza and I like the concept of the cheese under the sauce. However, my only complaint was the dough, although flavorful and tasty, was a bit doughy and undercooked. This seemed to be more so towards the center of the pie, the corner slices were more well done. I give it 4 stars, but another couples minutes in the oven could have given it 5.",5/8/2010,13,53,0,53nbNjRc6JB3MSHiNp9lEA
3518,George M.,0,3,"The place is loud... and crowded!  I felt as if I was sharing a table with the couple next to me our tables were so close.  Also the waiters are all over the place.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is lively and that's because people are enjoying their food and in the end, isn't that the most important thing?",4/25/2009,0,27,0,oWSJrSBZ9IlDfNh10FjmRA
3519,Ben C.,0,5,nobody serves an upside down sicilian like L&B's can! which is probably why you'll find a long line even on a Tuesday night. Their regular slices are nothing spectacular though. Their spumoni is awesome and they are generous with their scoops of icee too. Also picked up an eggplant parm and chicken parm--they were HUGE and damn good. The perfect place for a laid back summer evening in Bk.,1/10/2008,0,156,0,-ipe4RBLU62yo_jHhEVttg
3520,Mike M.,0,5,The best Sicilian pizza in the world. The sauce is simply amazing and this just might be the best pizza I've ever had. If you go you have to have the spumoni ice. Just might be the best spumoni in NY. This place is simply the best. If you live in NYC you have to come here at least once.,6/23/2009,102,23,0,-F1ErZ_uUdsT3c9C25D6Hg
3521,mike j.,0,5,"Went here on sunday prior to the Jets playoff game with friends. I had previously heard that others were saying there would be a large wait, but due to the rain and off peak hours as soon as we walked in we got a half tray. Easily the best sicilian slice I have ever had. The corner slices are amazing and the sauce to cheese combination is perfect. A little grated parmesan and red pepper even brings out the flavor more.",1/18/2010,0,9,0,JLsYG3-BVV3GwrB8m-MRzA
3522,J R.,0,3,"Not bad, just not as good as people claimed. Di Faras is better and Ninos on 3rd ave in Bayridge is better than both. Worth a try, but definitely not the best pizza in Brooklyn, or NYC for that matter.",1/1/2010,0,5,0,DqY1R3r0smozxLCR7rVHyw
3523,Kathryn L.,0,5,"I'm lucky enough to live just a few blocks from L&B Spumoni, and everyone I know who's ever been there is outrageously jealous. Two squares (from the edge, please) and a diet Pepsi for five bucks? Argh, heaven! And the restaurant is great, too. The calamari appetizer is gigantic, with a crisp, light breading giving way to tender, never chewy calamari. The salads are out of control, too - so huge that you could share them as an entree, and always fantastic. (My favorite is the grape tomato salad, with walnuts, dried dates, raw zucchini and ricotta salata, though their Caesar is seriously the best I've ever had.) The waiters are uneven - some can be cold, though most have gone out of their way to make us feel at home. If you're ordering dessert in the restaurant for a birthday or something, let them know it's a special occasion - you'll probably get a gigantic platter of spumoni decorated with whipped cream, cherries and enough sprinkles to choke a horse.",5/26/2008,4,34,8,gFjTdgJ9sRsROP7I3Sjh8Q
3524,Bruce S.,0,5,"this is as good as new york gets. nothing better than a warm summer night, sitting outside, eating a few sicilian slices and washing it down with rainbow spomoni. if you live in Manhattan, it is definitely worth the trip.",11/22/2009,3,20,0,xscmZDaK7rMm6alzeemf1w
