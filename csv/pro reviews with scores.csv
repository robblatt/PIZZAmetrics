19,best pizza,27,33,7,"The name sounds like the product of asking someone on level one of Rosetta Stone English what they thought of their first visit to New York. But you won’t care that typing the name into Google pulls up every pizza spot in the city, or that they only offer a few different kinds - because the wood-fired slices here are so good that you’ll keep burning the roof of your mouth instead of waiting two minutes for them to cool off. The classic cheese and the grandma square are both great, but the white pie with ricotta and caramelized onions is easily one of the best individual slices you can buy. It’s a good thing they didn’t spend more time on decor or workshopping their name. Clearly they were focused on more important things.Best Pizza is a wood-fired pizza spot that serves classic New York City slices in Williamsburg.Sometimes simple is best. Two-in-one shampoo and conditioner, E equals MC squared, Murphy beds. Thanks to these, you don’t need to worry about how well your Herbal Essences conditioner will work with your Pantene shampoo, or the best place to put a bed in a 200-square foot apartment, or how mass and energy are related in the universe. Best Pizza is another simple solution for something just as important - where to find great pizza-by-the-slice in Williamsburg.Pizza, Cheap Eats, Dining Solo, Late Night Eats, Lunch, Quick Eats, Serious Take-Out Operation, Naming yourself Best Pizza and opening up shop in the middle of Williamsburg is a bold move. Fortunately, Best Pizza does belong on a best pizza list. They execute classic New York pies and white pies at very high level, and unlike so many others on this list, the place is laid back and operated by very nice and friendly people.When it comes to the thoughtful reinvention of the classic New York slice here in the city, Frank Pinello may be Patient Zero. In retrospect, it seems inevitable. He was raised in Bensonhurst, trained at the CIA, and opened a slice shop in Williamsburg at the height of Brooklyn's mid-aughts renaissance. Those factors seem to have shaped the pizza he makes at Best, which is cooked in a massive brick bakery oven from the early 20th century—a setup that would have been familiar to the men who started the New York coal-oven giants Totonno's, John's, and Patsy's (though Best uses wood as fuel).  At the same time, Pinello's Culinary Institute chops reveal themselves in the attention he pays to ingredients—making, then shredding, fresh mozzarella for the cheese; pickling various vegetables for the sesame seed–crusted white ""pickled veg"" slice; respecting the ingredients enough to let them stand on their own, as with the nice bright sauce on the plain slice, which is made simply from good-quality crushed tomatoes. The crust on the regular slices is thin yet pliable, with a satisfyingly crisp-springy texture and great hole structure. The grandma slice has a light and crisp crust and a punchy sauce spiked with garlic and finely chopped anchovies. You simply cannot order the wrong slice here—and that's before we even mention the fantastic sandwiches, which we won't, because this list is all about pizza. The Vibe: Housed in a former bakery in Williamsburg, the homey pizzeria's walls are decorated with customer designed paper plates. You'd never know it from the modest digs and $3 slices, but this Williamsburg pizza joint boasts a serious pedigree. Occupying the former Brooklyn Star space, it's backed by the owners of Roberta's, who tapped Pulino's alum Frank Pinello as pizzaiolo. He's turning out pies topped with seasonal vegetables and local goods; the house-special Grandma pizza, available only by the square slice, features anchovy-laced plum tomato sauce and mozzarella. Perch on one of 16 wooden seats if you like, or take your grub to go—the food, not the ambience, is the real draw here.Mushroom with caramelized onion Best Pizza is a Williamsburg take on a classic slice joint. There's the simple menu of pizzas and heroes, a small selection of beers and wines to wash it down, booths and paper plates both for your pizza and decorating the walls. But this being Williamsburg, the pizzas have hip touches (a sesame crust on the white pie, for example), the oven is wood-fired and not a stacked gas oven. The simple name, spelled out in a sign that looks way older than the pizzeria's seven years, is a sort of tongue-in-cheek throwback. The soundtrack is loud rap instead of the oldies station or Frank Sinatra playlist you'll find at the usual corner place. And the pizza hits it out of the park: the ideal unfussy New York slice, thin crust and tasty tomato sauce covered in a just-sparse-enough blanket of cheese and classed up with some basil leaves. ""We use a wood-fired oven -- it's over 100 years old. I feel like that definitely makes a difference. You get a little more char on the pies; you get a little bit of a smokey flavor to it,"" general manager Hugo Chino said. ""We use fresh mozzarella on all of our pizza, we cook our mozzarella here and I feel like that makes us a little bit different from other pizzerias that are by the slice.""

The shop first opened in 1964, and Domenico De Marco has been behind the counter crafting delicious pies ever since. De Marco hand-makes each and every slice, so visitors may have to wait a while for their order, but it’s well worth it. At the shop, ask De Marco to make you a regular pizza topped with pepperoni. 1424 Avenue J.PepperoniThe Vibe: Lines abound at this Midwood pizzeria which consistently makes the list of best NYC pizzerias. Since the 1960's legendary pizza maker Domenico DeMarco has been artfully crafting pies behind the counter. Watch him at work as you wait for your slice. The painstakingly crafted Neapolitan pies—cracker-thin crust with a pleasing char and a subtle Parmesan zing—are widely considered among the city's best; dough is made fresh several times a day. To keep kids occupied during what feels like an interminable wait, point out the window boxes full of herbs used to flavor the sauce.Di Fara PizzaDi Fara opened in 1964, and the same man has been behind the counter ever since. His name is Dom DeMarco, and, if you come here, you’ll see him making every pie himself. This means that your pizza might take a little longer - but this also means that your pie will be excellent, bordering on perfect. The round one comes covered in several kinds of cheese and olive oil, the crust is slightly crunchy and salty, and the fresh basil will make you wonder why every pizza isn’t covered in fresh basil. And if you want something a little more intense, get the square pie. It has an excessive amount of cheese and sauce, and the crunchy crust tastes like it was soaked in butter. One slice will make you incredibly happy, and a second will make you want to get into a sleeping bag and watch a romcom.Brooklyn's Di Fara is the best slice of pizza in New York, and worth every bit of the $5 and 30 minutes of waiting that it will cost you.A $5 slice is not something we are particularly comfortable with. For a slice to justifiably cost that much money, it should probably either be topped with some kind of delicious and rare animal meat (panda?), or be the last f*cking slice of pizza in the world. The $5 slice of pizza at Di Fara is neither of those things. But it is the best pizza in New York.Pizza, Brooklyn, Classic Establishment, Serious Take-Out Operation, You’ll wait an hour for a $5 slice, but when it comes to Brooklyn pizza, nothing is as legendary as Di Fara. The quality ingredients, perfect sauce, and painstaking attention to detail make a trip to Di Fara an absolute requirement.Di Fara is the Mecca to which all die-hard pizza lovers should make a pilgrimage. It won't be on your way somewhere. You will wait a lot to be served then pay a lot to get your slice. You will either have to wipe down your own table or you won't even get one. But the amount of care and the quality of ingredients makes each pizza worth it.PepperoniEasily ranking among the very best pizza joints in New York City, old-school Di Fara Pizza in Midwood, Brooklyn, offers both square and traditional pies. One of the best aspects of enjoying pizza at Di Fara's is watching master pizzaiolo Dom DeMarco make each pie by hand, as he expertly tops each pie with sauce, hand-grated Parmesan cheese, fresh mozzarella, and basil. Try the pizzeria’s artichoke or sun-dried tomato slice, and even if the digs are spartan and seating is limited, it'll all be worth it. Weekends can bring crazy lines and long waits, so aim to go for lunch during the week if at all possible.For the pizza obsessed, Dom DeMarco is the greatest living New York pizza master. And his Midwood shop, Di Fara has become a point of pilgrimage for pizza fans. Its popularity and the fact that Dom still makes almost every pizza himself means that there will be a line any time you roll up. It's totally worth the wait. It's hard to describe perfection: from the flawless char to the savory milky cheese and fresh basil that's snipped over every pie, Di Fara's pizza is greater than the sum of its parts.What more is there to say about Di Fara that hasn't been covered in this epic 2009 post, ""All You Need to Know About Di Fara, 2009""? Well, turns out that a lot has changed in nearly 10 years—even at a place most people might have thought was frozen in time. Proprietor and pizza patriarch Dom De Marco still takes the pies out of the oven with his bare hands, still takes forever, but his daughter Maggie has semi-successfully made order out of chaos when it comes to ordering, writing down each order manually in a notebook with her own unique shorthand. Dom has a pizza-making assistant now, which helps some. They're not using fresh mozzarella on the regular pie anymore, and the fistfuls of freshly grated Grana Padano were replaced by pre-grated Romano after Dom's old counter-mounted rotary grater broke and he was unable to find a replacement. The Sicilian, which a lot of people prefer to the regular slice, was dense and tough. We much preferred the regular, which, even with the changes, somehow still tasted like Di Fara. He may have lost a step, but so does every great athlete before they retire. Scott calls it ""the pilgrimage pizzeria of NYC."" What is there to left say to about Di Fara? Forget every hipster pie you've had in a place with funky décor or cool music. Go to Midwood, where your refuge from the long waits for your pizza will be kosher bakeries instead of cocktail dens. While you can order by the slice, you're going to wind up waiting for it anyway -- waiting to order, then waiting until there are enough slice orders to make the pie, then waiting until the pie is made. So do yourself a favor and an order a pie, round or square. Then add a slice from a pie you didn't choose, so you can try it. The slices are $5, the most expensive in the city, but they are worth the price, the wait and the journey to a neighborhood you might have little other reason to visit. For years, part of the draw was that Dom DeMarco was the only one who would make the pizza. He's 80 now and has ceded some of the responsibility to others.  ""He never tried to be the best. He never said, 'Oh, I'm the best.' Everyone else pointed that out to him,"" his daughter Margaret Mieles said. ""What we do is so unique because we import our ingredients, and obviously, if you're doing something 51 years, if you're good at it, you become great at it. If you become great at it, you become extraordinary at it."" If you're lucky, you'll visit on a day when he's there, pulling the pizzas out of the oven with his bare hands, slicing basil imported from Israel on top, moving slowly but surely. He'll work until he's tired, Mieles said, and someone else will take over. Whoever makes your pizza, it will be delicious: a perfectly crisp crust, a sheen of olive oil that picks up the flavor of that basil, high-quality mozzarella and salty parmigiano reggiano, a tangy-sweet tomato sauce, everything in absolute balance.

""A lot of pizza restaurants are of the mentality that everything has to be Italian cheese and Italian flours and Italian tomatoes shipped in,"" Emily Hyland said. That's not the case with Emily's pizzas, which Emily Hyland pegged as ""New York/New Haven style"" -- thin and well done, but without the puffy, char-speckled crust common to Neapolitan pies, and with the toppings more evenly distributed to avoid a softer center. People loved it, so when the couple opened a second joint -- Emmy Squared in Williamsburg -- you'd think they'd bring the menu. Instead, they rolled out another game-changer: pan pizzas with crisp crusts and cheesy fried edges that have kept customers flocking. Brooklyn's pizza is legendary on two fronts, Hyland said -- old-school places like Totonno's and L&B and new-school places like Roberta's -- which meant it was pretty intimidating to wade into the market and offer up something new. ""It was terrifying,"" she said. ""And Matt always talks about, 'I can't believe that we've been able to be successful in the pizza world in New York.'

55,emmy squared,96,103,8,"Emmy Squared — less formal than Emily and with restaurants in the East Village and Williamsburg — serves Detroit-style pizza. If seeking roni cups, go for the Colony (pepperoni with pickled jalapeños and honey) or the Roni Supreme (“lots of pepperoni,” Calabrian chilies).Thanks to Emmy Squared, you can get a taste of Detroit-style pizza in Williamsburg. Their homage to the style includes the characteristic topping-centric, twice-baked, rectangular deep dish pies. The Roni Supreme combines hand-cut pepperoni and Calabrian chiles for a tasty zing and a memorable sting with every bite. Beneath the toppings on each pie lies a golden-brown melted cheese, which provides a tasty foundation and crunchy texture to the surprisingly filling slice. Roni SupremeThe people behind Emily opened this newer spot in Williamsburg where they serve rectangular pizzas. The pizza aren't Sicilian, however - they're Detroit-style. That means crispy crust on the outside, fluffy crust on the inside, and plenty of cheese. Get yours with burrata and basil or just stick to the pepperoni.Emmy Squared in Williamsburg is the adult version of your childhood pizza party dreams.Remember the almighty pizza party?

But their finest contribution to the city’s pie repertoire is the Detroit-inspired square pies that first debuted at their second restaurant, Emmy Squared in Williamsburg. Closer to a grandma pie than a heftier Sicilian, Emmy Squared’s pies somehow improve on the Midwestern inspiration: There’s cheese in the dough, and basically no crust, with a fine, lacy, crunchy trim of melted cheese on the pie’s parameters. There’s another location that’s great for groups in the East Village, and Matt Hyland’s Alphabet City grilled pizza spot Violet is a stellar date destination.You’re an adult, which means responsibility and taxes and all that, but it also means you can eat whatever you want. If you want pancakes for dinner, nobody is going to stop you. And if you want an insanely rich pizza with crust covered in molten, melted cheese - the people at Emmy Squared will just ask if you want some waffle fries doused with mayo on the side. The fluffy, cheesy Detroit-style pies have a fried and crispy crust, and they’re topped with things like banana peppers and thick ranch dressing.

Our only issue is that the prices are noticeably higher here than on Staten Island - although Manhattan tends to have that effect on things.Pizza, Italian, Casual Weeknight Dinner, Classic Establishment,  If you are a connoisseur of thin-crust pizza, get yourself to Joe & Pat's, which has been dishing it out since 1960, setting the bar for the crispy pies that typify the borough's pizza scene. ""It's thin crust, fresh sauce, and we use the cubed mozzarella so it has the spotty cheese on it,"" owner Casey Pappalardo said. ""It's a nice look."" Joe & Pat's, too, has come to Manhattan -- opening an outpost in lower Manhattan in April 2017 -- but, like Denino's, the original is worth visiting. The celebrated Staten Island pizza stalwart, open since 1960, has made its extra-crunchy, mozzarella-laden thin-crust pies available in the East Village. Co-owned by Casey Pappalardo, his father, and two uncles, the family-run place opened its first Manhattan location in spiffier digs than the original Joe & Pat’s. Here, there are wood tables, a full bar, and real plates instead of paper ones. In addition to pizza, expect well-executed takes on classic dishes like chicken parm and shrimp scampi.If you never leave Manhattan, you might think that Rubirosa is the only place that makes a super-thin-crust pie with excellent vodka sauce. This is not, however, the case. The vodka pie at Joe & Pat’s is only slightly inferior to the one at Rubirosa - and by that we mean that it’s one of the best pizzas you can eat in this city. Due to the thinness of the crust here, you probably don’t want to get more than one additional topping on any one pie, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It means you can eat more pizza, which you will inevitably want to do here. If you don’t live in Staten Island, this place alone is worth the trip.Topped with creamy mozzarella melted in cubes upon a rich bed of savory tomato sauce spread to the edge of a thin crisp crust, a Joe & Pat’s pizza takes simple ingredients and prepares them exquisitely. It’s a recipe that has been perfected over the past 50 years and we hope it never changes. And now, you can get a taste at the East Vilalge outpost.Plain cheese",Joe & Pat’s Pizzeria,"4503, 168 1st Avenue, New York, NY 10009",2.856677524429967,0.9955744117456238

The Carmine Street pizza spot makes the best New York slice in New York.

The slices taste and look the way they did 30 years ago; there’s still a red border of pure tomato next to the outer crust, and the pies aren’t pulled from the oven until the cheese has a suntan.King of the neighborhood pizza parlors, Manhattan edition, Joe’s offers a slice magnificent in its plainness, appreciated by generations of New Yorkers and visitors. No frou-frou here, just a well-pureed sauce and just enough cheese — but not too much — and one of the city’s most perfect crusts. On the other hand, for just a bit more you can get the fresh mozzarella slice, with little annealed gobs of newly minted cheese. But the best-selling slice, according to a counter guy I talked to, is the pepperoni slice. Miraculously, new branches of this place near Union Square, Times Square, and in Williamsburg have not diminished its brilliance.Listen. Joe's is a good slice. A great one, depending on your level of inebriation, even. It's sweet and it's larger than your head and regardless of how that all makes you feel, you've gotta try it at least once.For a quick slice late-night—or any other time—you can’t beat this classic chain of Manhattan/Brooklyn pizzerias (the original West Village location opened in 1975). The thin-crust plain and pepperoni slices here are the real-deal, affordable, New York City-style pizza of your imagination—fast, easy, no-frills, but downright delicious. Happily, you’ll find consistent pizza goodness at any of Joe’s Pizza’s four outposts.Great pizza doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg. Just look at Joe’s Pizza as the prime example. The pizza shop, which has been operating since 1975, has been serving up delicious slices for decades and at just $2.75 per slice. Tha means visitors can buy a slice for the same price as a subway ridePriceThis is the New York–iest of New York slices. It defines classic NY slice pizza—crisp, thin crust, crushed canned tomatoes as sauce, low-moisture mozzarella for cheese. Don't bother with the fresh-mozz slices—they're invariably bland.

87,julianas,157,161,5," Gather 'round for the saga of how acclaimed pizzaiolo Patsy Grimaldi came to Juliana's after running Grimaldi's, formerly known as Patsy's. Grimaldi learned the business at his uncle's restaurant Patsy's in East Harlem, one the city's great early pizzerias, and opened his own Patsy's under the Brooklyn Bridge in 1990. But in 1995 he was sued by the man who'd bought the East Harlem Patsy's, and the end result was a name change to Grimaldi's. In 1998, Grimaldi decided to get out of the pizza game, so he and his wife sold Grimaldi's to a customer. Over time, Grimaldi became frustrated with the way his namesake was being run, leading to bad blood as Grimaldi's expanded but its critical reputation suffered. When Grimaldi's moved a few doors down, Patsy Grimaldi wound up reclaiming his old space with another former customer of his, co-owner Matt Grogan. Unable to use either of his own names, Grimaldi christened the new restaurant with his mother's name: Juliana. ""I thought when I had the pizza for the first time in 1990, that not only was it the best pizza I had ever had in my life, but it was the best thing I ever had in my life,"" Grogan said. Grimaldi, 85, still comes in every night, and the pizza is made to his exacting standards, in a coal-fired oven and topped with ingredients like tomatoes that come from an Italian co-op that you can get only at Juliana's and one other restaurant, on the West Coast. The edges are blistered, the coal imparts a signature flavor and the decades of experience shine through in every perfect bite. ""We're not trying to make Italian pizza,"" Grogan said. ""We're making New York pizza, the way it was first made 100 years ago."" Patsy Grimaldi—the flour-dusted legend behind Grimaldi's, which has since changed hands—busts out of retirement to reclaim his pie shop's first location, along with its original coal oven. The octogenarian pizzaiolo–who learned to spin dough at age 13 in his Uncle Patsy Lancieri's Harlem institution—named the spot after his mother. The menu spotlights iconic red-sauce fare, including classic pies (Margherita, sausage and broccoli rabe), appetizers (eggplant rollatine, baked clams with parsley) and desserts (cannoli), but the New York icon mixed in a few nods to modern times, like a bagel-riffing pie made with lox and mascarpone. Juliana'sArmed with a tried-and-true coal oven, owner Patsy Grimaldi came out of retirement to to open his new Brooklyn Heights pizzeria called Juliana’s. He couldn't name it after himself because both his first and last name's were already taken by two of his biggest competitors: Patsy’s and Grimaldi's. This blistered beauty is a white pie topped with mozzarella, smokey scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil.No. 1 SpecialOne of the main pizza destinations in Brooklyn Heights.This is the main Grimaldi’s alternative. It’s only a few doors down from that more-famous pizzeria, and it gets pretty busy as well. That’s because Patsy Grimaldi opened it (after he sold Grimaldi’s).

88,kesté,162,167,6,"Since owner Robert Caporuscio started slinging Neapolitan pies in 2009, Kesté has been among the city’s top places for the Southern Italian style of pizza. It’s comprised of extra-fine “00” Caputo flour, San Marzano tomatoes, and buffalo mozzarella, with a crisp-pillowy hybrid crust and premium, sparingly applied toppings. A dizzying range of dozens of pies are on offer, some starring harder-to-find toppings like walnut cream or bresaola. Caporuscio has expanded Keste to Fidi, with a 5,000-square-foot outpost that includes a pizza school helmed by Caporuscio’s daughter, Giorgia.As anticipated, Kesté serves up some of the best pizza in town.If there's one cuisine whose hype is usually warranted, it's pizza. Because of its universal nature, critics and ""the people"" will generally see eye to eye. At the end of the day most pizza is either fantastic or good enough and it doesn't take a food expert to distinguish between the two. With these facts in mind, The Infatuation was fired up to investigate New York Mag's declaration of Kesté as NYC's best pie of the moment.Pizza, Dining Solo, With the original located in the West Village (there are newer outposts Downtown and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn), Kesté offers pizza lovers both classic and creative Neapolitan pizzas that are prepared in a wood-fired oven. Chef Roberto Caporuscio grew up outside of Naples and learned his craft there before opening Kesté in New York City. Although homemade mozzarella cheese graces most of the pies, folks with dietary restrictions will love the gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan offerings on the menu.It wasn’t that long ago that we picked Kesté’s pizza as New York’s numero uno. But don’t regard the pizzeria’s third-place ranking on this listicle as a sign that quality on Bleecker Street has slipped, or that Roberto Caporuscio has lost his touch. No, the pizza at Kesté is as good as ever — soft and tender, charred and chewy, and about as well balanced as Sting and Trudie Styler in the yab-yum pose. No, what’s happened is that the craze for Neapolitan pizza Kesté helped ignite has created a lot of competition, which is not a bad thing for Neapolitan pizza fans.How blessed are we to live in a day and age that such a thing as burrata pizza exists? And, furthermore, that there are people who've mastered the hell out of it?Mamma mia! New York’s love affair with Kesté shows no sign of stopping. This kitchen begins with a puffy, blistered crust that’s perfectly salty and tangy, then tops it with ingredients like roasted butternut squash purée, smoked mozzarella and basil. And while its ingredients seem to have taken a small hit in recent years, that crust is still on point. Co-owner Roberto Caporuscio presides over the American chapter of Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, and his daughter, Giorgia, oversees the in-house pizza making operations. Diners can choose from more than 22 pizzas (including a few gluten-free options), a roster of calzoni and nightly pie specials.

It’s thick and rectangular, with a crispy base and a large amount of dough that would be classified as medium rare if it were a steak. On top, you’ll find tomato sauce, melted cheese, then even more tomato sauce - producing something that almost feels like a lasagna, but better. There are layers to this pizza, and every slice is so substantial that you won’t ever need to add toppings.

Pizza and ice cream are what L&B, a local favorite out in south Brooklyn, are all about. You’ll want the famous square slice, and a cup of spumoni – a kind of Italian ice/ice cream hybrid.The long-cooked sauce is famous for two things: It goes on top of the cheese and it once sparked an interborough pizza dispute that involved alleged members of two mob families. L&B makes a regular slice, but almost everybody gets the squares: tallish, crunchy and browned underneath, with a thick, soft interior you can use for sponging up runaway sauce on your paper plate.Since 1939, this Bensonhurst original—where muscle-bound Brooklynites with deep accents gather in the outdoor patio—has served one of the best Sicilian slices in town. Candy-sweet tomato sauce is generously slathered over tall, doughy rectangles with a crunchy browned bottom. It’s finished with squares of melted mozzarella and zippy strands of Parm.SicilianWhen someone talks about an ""L&B–style slice,"" they're often talking about the way this legendary Gravesend pizzeria assembles its square pizzas: dough, slices of low-moisture mozzarella, then the sauce. This is followed by a dusting of grated Romano cheese all over, especially along the edges, where it bakes into the crust, creating a kind of accidental Parmesan stick—you know, like those breadsticks that have just a dusting of baked-on cheese. But there's more to it than that. The crust is like no other. The bottom is plenty crisp, but the interior is tender and soft—it's airy, even though it has a tight-to-medium crumb. Where the cheese and crust meet, the two become one. Some people find this off-putting because, when you bite in, it feels like the dough is undercooked. But, as Scott pointed out to us, this is a false ""gum line""—a line in the crust where the dough is still raw, which can happen in improperly cooked pizza. What's happening with L&B's is that your teeth push the melted cheese into the dough, creating the impression of a gum line. The L&B Sicilian slice really is its own thing. And let's be clear that we're talking only about the Sicilian here, because that is 100% the pizza they're known for. The square pie here has inspired many an imitator, but L&B still does it the best. A chewy, thick crust is topped first with the mozzarella, then with the tangy tomato sauce, then with a sprinkle of grated cheese. The flip of the cheese and the sauce seems simple, but it changes the whole texture of the pizza, setting it apart from other Sicilian slices and creating a different mouth feel as you get a hit of the soft, acidic sauce before encountering the snap of the cheese and chew of the curst. At the end of the slice you get to the crispy, charred edge. You will want another. And then another. But don't forget to save room for the namesake spumoni, best enjoyed outside in the ""garden"" -- a concrete slab full of red chain-link tables -- on your way home from the beach on a summer day. First opened in 1939, L&B Spumoni Gardens in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is most famous for its Sicilian pie, spumoni, and Italian ices. They have casual outdoor seating, perfect for when the weather is nice, as well as a more formal inside dining room with a full menu of classic red-sauce Italian cuisine.

A red and green neon sign shines in shop's half-moon window, which looks into the sunken first floor of a two-story standalone home. Step inside and brothers Cosmo and John Tiso will serve you one of the best thin-crust sausage slices you've ever eaten. The Tisos, who took over Louie & Ernie's in 1987, source their crumbly, fennel-spiced pork sausage from S&D Caterers, a mom-and-pop operation a few blocks north. They plop heaps of raw meat onto a fresh pie before baking it in the pizzeria's gas-fired oven. The meat emerges browned, swimming in luscious pools of its own rendered fat. Cosmo, 47, and John, 51, have perfected their pizza over the course of three decades, working side by side in the same cramped kitchen. What's it like, working with your sibling for that long? ""It's like a marriage, and we've never had a fight,"" John says, a twinkle in his eye. NoneLet's use the superb, just-thin-enough slice at Louie and Ernie's to talk about topping distribution, because something they do there illustrates this concept perfectly: They put a little pinch of black pepper in the center of the pie, so your first bite has that zing. This is called center-loading. Another technique they're adept at here is evenly distributing the toppings so each bite is uniform.  These are the small differences you might not notice, but they're integral to making your favorite slice your favorite slice. There's also a bit of cornmeal on the underside here, which offers some extra texture.

108,louies,207,208,2,"NoneThe superb grandma slice at Louie's—light, not too thick, nice and airy and crisp—is an example of why it pays not to be too strict about categorizing and nomenclature. For the longest time, I mistakenly believed that a grandma was simply a ""thinner Sicilian,"" one that typically had a lot of garlic (but sometimes not) and that often had the sauce painted on in diagonal stripes (but not always). But Scott set me straight a while ago, explaining that a grandma's dough is pressed out into its rectangular pan, topped, and then baked immediately, while a Sicilian dough is left to rise, or ""proof,"" in the pan before it's topped and baked. (At L&B, they actually top it with cheese and sauce and then let it proof.)  Per Scott's definition, the star of the show at Louie's Pizzeria is technically a Sicilian, since it proofs in the pan. Moreover, it's an upside-down Sicilian, because the cheese (fresh mozzarella, in this case) goes on first, covered by an ample amount of crushed plum tomatoes seasoned with lots of garlic, basil, and Pecorino Romano. Even if you don't remember these details, just remember to get the grandma at Louie's. The regular slice is perfectly fine; better than average, really, and I'd be happy to order it if it were my local and we needed round pies for some reason. But it's just not in the same universe as the grandma there. What's more, Louie's embodies the very notion of the Beloved Neighborhood Fave, which is why it's at the top of this category and not in alphabetical order, like we've done elsewhere.  Even though we believe we're in the middle of a pizza renaissance, and even though a lot of pie-makers may be turning out the most technically well-crafted pizzas we've seen in a generation, one thing that seems to be in short supply is a form of genuine hospitality, something that isn't part of a self-conscious ""strategy"" designed to wow you. You might not notice the difference until you finally get your butt to a place like Louie's.  From the outside, it's an unassuming place, which, truth be told, is part of the reason I initially hadn't bothered to check it out. It was neither knowingly hip-looking like Scarr's, nor was it charmingly old-school like J&V. Step inside, though, and you're greeted immediately and enthusiastically by Louie. If he doesn't know you, he introduces himself (though he declined to disclose his last name for this story). The people cycling in and out all seem to be regulars—if they're not, you wouldn't know it from the way Louie chitchats with them. The customers are a diverse lot—this is Queens, after all, on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. But more than just the racial diversity you'd expect, you've got people from seemingly all walks of life. There are the cops—it is very cop-heavy—picking up dinner for themselves and colleagues. There's staff from Elmhurst Hospital across the street. There's a bougie-looking dad and son, plus a large multigenerational family there for the non-pizza food (which I understand is also quite good).  Over the course of three consecutive evenings there, I saw several of the same faces, all of them bantering with Louie and often with one another. Louie's is a community hub. It's more than just a place you go to collect a photo for your Instagram feed—though, admittedly, those grandma slices translate to mega likes.  Are non-Queensers going to rush out here from other boroughs? Probably not. As fantastic as the grandma is, the place is a schlep if you don't live in the area, and you can probably find a slice just as fulfilling, in one way or another, closer to home. But if you live nearby, you know the qualities that bring you to a place like Louie's—or to Delmar in Brooklyn, or Nunzio's on Staten Island, or Sal & Carmine on the Upper West Side—and you advocate loudly for your spot.

109,lucali,209,218,10,"Old Brooklyn is harder to find these days, but Mark Iacono, owner of Lucali in Carroll Gardens, built his restaurant by hand and is working tirelessly to preserve the traditions of his neighborhood through pizza. Plus, he opened up one of the greatest pizza places in New York City without any pizza-making experience. The signature pies are ""what a classic margherita should taste like"" according to The Pizza Show's own Frank Pinello, because ""the tomato sauce with the milky buffalo mozzarella and hard cheese makes it creamy and tangy at the same time.""This laid-back neighborhood BYO spot in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, offers just two menu items: wood-fired, brick-oven pizzas and calzones. You can bring your own beer or wine to enjoy alongside your meal (though they do have some nonalcoholic beverage choices, as well). Cash-only Lucali opens evenings just shy of 6 p.m., but there are often an hour or more long waits for a table, even if you arrive shortly before opening. That said, the pizza is superlative and well worth the wait (there's a reason it's a celebrity magnet for folks like David Beckham, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé). Put your name on the list and head out to one of the great bars along nearby Smith Street to kill time while you wait for your table.  Lucali is another pizza spot that has been so thoroughly hyped, is so critically acclaimed and well-loved, that it's hard to imagine the food will live up to it. But the laid-back, comfortable, dimly lit pizzeria run by Carroll Gardens native Mark Iacono never disappoints. There's no paper menu: just pies, calzones and toppings. The pizzas, sprinkled with fresh basil and garlic (other toppings are extra), are extraordinary. So are the calzones, but that's another list for another day. Yes, you'll wait -- so plan on toting around a bottle of wine or two (it's BYOB), spending an hour or more at a nearby bar while you await your call from the hostess with the wonderful news that it'll be your turn to enjoy a pretty perfect pizza. Owner and chef Mark Iacono takes to his dough as a sculptor to his marble, carefully crafting every pizza as if it were a one-of-a-kind piece of art. He adds fresh mozzarella and a careful mixture of sharp cheeses to maximize the flavor of each pie. The onions and mushrooms are skillfully layered in order to enhance, rather than overpower, the essence of the other ingredients. The end result is nothing short of perfection.Hot peppers with shallotsCome to Lucali and you will wait. Maybe for hours. And the hostess may make fun of you. Why? Because she can. Because this is the best sit-down pizza restaurant in New York.It can be annoying to deal with an unpredictable situation, but for pizza this good, we’re willing to deal with it. Brooklyn's Lucali is incredible.Whether or not you are a fan of Lucali seems to come down to two things - how long you had to wait for your table, and how you were treated in the process. The few people that have told us this place is overrated complained not about the pizza, but had beef because the sarcastic Brooklyn girl up front wasn’t so nice to them. We get it - we have definitely been on the receiving end of some half-serious abuse from a Lucali waitress. As a matter of fact, I believe I was officially banned from the restaurant last time because I asked twice about the toppings.Pizza, Brooklyn, BYOB, Impressing Out of Towners, Serious Take-Out Operation, Head to this cozy Carroll Gardens restaurant for pizza and generously stuffed calzone that’s worth the often-lengthy wait. The snug, tin-ceilinged space affords great views of the pizza-making action, and if it’s not too muggy, nab a table outside on picturesque Henry Street. Mark Iacono’s thin-crust pizzas are unfussy, with a three-cheese blend of fresh and imported mozzarella and Grana Padano, plus fresh basil. It’s BYOB, so bring a good red to pair with a pie and calzone.We could tell you about the way the chefs at Lucali roll out the dough with empty wine bottles in front of a wood-fired oven. We could tell you that this restaurant is BYOB, and that the little room feels like a spiritual place of pizza worship. But we’re not here to talk about those details that make Lucali an excellent place to eat. We’re here to talk about pizza. The thin-but-not-too-thin crust is the exact right balance of soft and crunchy, and the tomato sauce is the platonic ideal of tomato sauce: a little sweet, a little tangy, and good enough to eat with a spoon. Besides that, it’s just cheese and basil. If you want to add more toppings, you can, but you don’t need to. This pizza is absolutely perfect on its own, and the best one we’ve had in New York. And if you don’t think it’s worth waiting several hours for, then we don’t have anything in common.The artisanal intent at the candlelit pizzeria is visible in the flour-dashed marble counter where the dough is punched and stretched, and in the brick oven from which it later emerges crisp and blistered. There are just two items on Lucali’s menu: pies and calzones, adorned with milky, elastic mozzarella and simple toppings like chewy rounds of pepperoni or slivers of artichoke.

115,mamas too,225,229,5,"Mama's Too opened on Broadway and West 105th Street in late 2017, having spun off of longtime Upper West Side pizzeria Mama's, just around the corner. Too often, the story of decades-old mom-and-pop restaurants ends with the youngest generation ""moving up"" in the world and out of the business. But there's a great counter-narrative to that, and it's one where fresh blood pulls the business into the present while honoring the past. We've seen it here in NYC with Wilson Tang at Nom Wah Tea Parlor, Niki Russ Federman at Russ & Daughters, and Jason Wang of Xi'an Famous Foods. For Mama's Too, owner/operator Frank Tuttolomondo built on foundations established at Mama's, where the pizza is standard slice-joint fare. ""I knew I couldn't change the pizza there, or regulars would be upset,"" Frank said. ""So I opened this place."" When it's available and fresh from the oven, the pizza at Mama's Too is fantastic. (The small shop has trouble keeping up with demand, and the slices can suffer on reheat.) The squares are superb, with a satisfying crisp-chewy quality and a nice open crumb that still stands up to the substantial toppings. Tuttolomondo says he's inspired by noted Roman pizza-maker Gabriele Bonci—but that he's trying to bridge the gap between Roman-style pizza al taglio (that is, pizza ""by the cut"") and New York squares. Gap bridged. The regular slice employs some Di Fara–esque touches. Like Dom De Marco, Tuttolomondo does the whole post-oven cheese-grating-and-tons-of-basil thing. The crust is made from a 70% hydrated dough, leading to a very open, airy crumb and a light, crisp bite. As a general rule, most pizza is best eaten straight out of the oven, but we strongly recommend eating a regular slice from Mama's Too as fresh from the oven as possible; it loses some of its ethereal qualities when you let it sit.The regular “house slice” combines the darkly caramelized, bready crust and pure-tomato flavor of a Neapolitan pie with the grab-and-go portability of a streetcorner slice. The squares, meanwhile, merge the Sicilian, Detroit, and Roman pizza al taglio styles in one dark, crunchy whole, fringed with what is known as a “frico crust” — the edges of browned cheese where the dough meets the pan. The pepperoni square in particular is an unstoppable force. Mama’s Too makes experimental pizza for the people.Mama’s Too is a tiny pizza place on the Upper West Side, and it’s where you’ll find some of the best slices in the area. Get the square pepperoni one.A typical NYC slice shop has a few basic elements. A counter and a glass case, for example, as well an area where you can spritz your pizza with chili flakes and burn your mouth on some cheese that’s only slightly hotter than the Earth’s core (if you’re an impatient kind of person). Mama’s Too has all of these things - but it isn’t your average counter-service pizza place.Pizza, Quick Eats, Mama’s Too is one of the new crop of neighborhood pizzerias that have reconfigured their slices to be more modern and innovative than that of the classic neighborhood pizzeria. (The place is related to a more conventional pizzeria on Amsterdam Avenue.) This is all to the good, you’ll realize as you survey the collection of square pies with rich crusts and atypical toppings. The pepperoni slice uses a small-bore sausage packed tightly on the slice, weeping paprika oil down on the crust. Other pies include caramelized onion and mushroom, and zucchini with Kalamata olives. In a review last year, Times restaurant critic Pete Wells wrote that Mama’s Too “combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows.” Even better, it’s got roni cups.",Mama's Too!,"2750 Broadway, New York, NY 10025",1.58957654723127,0.9842021191397949

It's hidden on the restaurant's dinner menu, among heftier Neapolitan fare like veal marsala and gamberetti fra diavolo, as an antipasto. (You can also order it to go or at lunchtime.) Mario's plain margherita pie boasts a thicker, crispier crust than the standard Neapolitan kind -- in part because it's cooked at lower temperatures in a gas oven, rather than a wood-fired one. The very bottom has an almost woodsy taste and grainy texture, from particles of high-gluten flour. Migliucci's family keeps the toppings simple: crushed Italian plum tomatoes, salt, basil leaves and square slices of a house-made ""loaf"" mozzarella that blisters handsomely when cooked.

126,montes,245,245,1," Monte's claims to be the oldest Italian restaurant in Brooklyn, though it did have a bit of a hiatus. It first opened in 1906 as Angelo's Tavern, served as a speakeasy during Prohibition and was revamped into Monte's Venetian Room in the 1930s, going on to draw a Rat Pack clientele for Italian-American food. But it abruptly closed in 2008. It reopened in 2011 under new ownership, the Venetian part of the name (and the murals that went with it) were ditched, and the menu was tweaked to focus less on chicken parm and more on authentic Neapolitan dishes -- among them, pizza. The pizzas at Monte's are oblong, served on boards, available in 12-inch or ""Metropolitan"" size (best described as really big), and deliver on the promise of a Neapolitan pie, with a puffy but crispy crust. And then there are the toppings. The Margherita pie has mozzarella di bufala; the Reale has tomato, mozzarella, fried eggplant, prosciutto and basil; and the Salsiccia has tomato, mozzarella, sausage and red onion. All are winners. The restaurant is more under the radar than some spots on this list, with a vibe that's way more old-school Brooklyn than hipster, but it's worth a little trip back in time the next time you're in Gowanus to play shuffleboard.

Start with a Margherita pie: fior di latte, basil, pecorino, olive oil and sea salt. Or upgrade to the Dom Dom: buffalo mozzarella, primo sale (a sheep's cheese) and parmigiano. Or go in an entirely different direction, with white pies showered with Brussels sprouts and pancetta or bresaola and baby kale.

149,patsys pizzeria,287,295,9,"While there are several pizzerias that share their name, only the original one was opened by Pasquale “Patsy” Lancieri and his wife, Carmella, in 1933. The East Harlem locale is still owned by the families of the former employees. The meatball pie is topped with just-right amount of rich tomato sauce, creamy low-moisture mozzarella cheese and homemade meatballs on a firm yet crisp, perfectly charred crust. Plus, it's the only place that serves coal-fired brick oven pizza by the slice.Cheese with meatballThis East Harlem, fourth-generation, family-run institution has been slinging thin-crust, coal oven-fired pies since 1933. It’s still one of the only coal-fired pizzerias in town to offer single slices alongside whole pies. There are a few watered-down offshoots now, but there’s a certain, special charm to the Harlem original.The slices doled out in Patsy’s takeout wing next to the sit-down restaurant are in a style of their own, one with its roots in the brick-oven pies of early immigrants from Naples. Sauce is applied as if with a paintbrush to the thin and somewhat floppy crust, and the pizza is lightly charred in one of the city’s last coal-heated ovens. The slices have some of the old-time flavor you get at John’s of Bleecker Street or Totonno, both rigidly antislice. Although Patsy’s has a few Manhattan locations, hit up the original East Harlem branch for the most authenticity. A true neighborhood institution, politicians, celebrities and neighborhood residents alike can often be found dining and socializing at Patsy's, which has been open here since 1933. Serving up delicious paper-thin pies and slices from its hard-to-come-by coal-fired oven, visitors have the option of either grabbing a quick slice from the to-go  area or sitting down to order pizza pies (and other menu items) in the simple dining room.Patsy's is a legitimate institution. You must go to the original or else you cannot say you've gone at all. Capiche?The original Patsy’s in East Harlem makes excellent pizza for a sit-down meal or a slice at the counter. The original Patsy’s Pizzeria has been in this very same location since 1933, when Pasquale ‘Patsy’ himself opened the doors. And the pizza looks like the results of a Google image search of “NYC pizza” - although if you called it ordinary, that would be very wrong. When you’re here, it doesn’t matter if you’re getting a whole pie or just a slice from the counter. What does matter is that you’ll need to order the plain – it’s thin and soft but holds up the bright red sauce and big circles of mozzarella cheese, and it’s the reason you’re coming to Patsy’s.Pizza, Italian, Classic Establishment, Kids, Quick Eats, Patsy’s, which first opened its doors in 1933, has kept things the same for 85 years. While it’s added a few newer specialty pies to its menu, diners can’t go wrong by ordering its classic cheese pizza that comes with a crust that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, fresh tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheeseClassic SlicePatsy's is a treasure. It's one of only two coal-oven pizzerias selling by the slice in New York—and a plain slice goes for only $1.75. An example of minimalist perfection, the Patsy's slice has been remarkably consistent ever since I've been in New York. [Editor's note: That is, since 1973.] Sure, it's smaller than most slices, but it's cheaper than any other good slice in New York. In the dining room, they offer a choice of fresh or low-moisture mozzarella—the only coal-oven pizzeria to do so—but at the slice counter next door, LMM is the default.This pizza looks like the results of a Google image search of “NYC pizza.” But if you called it ordinary, that would be very wrong.

Someday you’ll teach Logan not to be such a jerk, we’re sure of it. In the meantime, be spoiled yourself and go eat a pizza topped with blue cheese, cherries, and prosciutto or hot honey at Paulie Gee’s in Greenpoint. While Roberta’s takes a slight edge for its crust, Paulie Gee’s is the king of inventive, unexpected pairings of toppings. The huge barn-like space and entertaining interactions with Paulie himself, who’s always roaming around the room, also makes this one of our absolute favorite places to have a meal in Brooklyn. In a borough crowded with pizza, Phill Errigo was taking a big chance when he opened Paulie's in Stapleton in 2015. ""There's nothing but good pizza on Staten Island, so it's certainly not an easy genre,"" Errigo said. But the pizza spot hits it out of the park with a classic thin-crust pie -- ""always on the well-done side, which is the way pizza should be,"" Errigo noted -- and other Italian classics Errigo learned from his dad, Paulie. He's doling them out in a neighborhood that's changing quickly, with an influx of artists and, yes, hipsters. But he draws longtime locals, too. ""They have been waiting for good food, and the residents have been waiting for good food for a long time,"" Errigo said. NonePizza hobbyist turned pro Paul Giannone produces truly original pies at this rustic Greenpoint eatery. The best pizzas here are mixed-media masterworks with gorgeously blackened crusts covered in crispy nooks and pillowy bubbles. The Cherry Jones—featuring honey from a Brooklyn beekeeper, Gorgonzola, mozzarella, cherries and wispy prosciutto—beautifully balances sweet and salty. The Whiter Shade of Kale sees a nut-free kale pesto fired atop gooey mozzarella. Ask for a seat in the back for a view of the roaring oven—a custom-built, while-tiled dome that burns up to 1,000 degrees.Paulie Gee'sCreative toppings are the M.O. at this Greenpoint favorite, and owner Paul Giannone often utilizes local, indie purveyors in his pies. Don’t miss the sopressata honey hellboy, which includes Mike’s Hot Honey for some kick; another solid bet is the anise and anephew, which has braised fennel fronds, guanciale, and anisette creme. There are also Paulie Gee locations in Columbus, Baltimore, and Chicago, plus a Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop offshoot, also in Greenpoint.Backyard hobbyist turned professional pizzaiolo Paul Giannone’s pies are light and airy with a deep char and a micro-layer of crispness, and in the same pristine class as the ones he once idolized at Kesté, Motorino, and the late, great Una Pizza Napoletana. The former software-quality-assurance engineer also has a healthy, no-holds-barred approach to toppings (and local collaborations), most apparent, perhaps, in the Hometown Brisket pie: fresh mozzarella, brisket from Red Hook’s Hometown Bar-B-Que, pickled red onion, and a judicious drizzle of Hometown Bar-B-Que sauce.Pizza has never been more fun, more exciting, or more satisfying than it is at Paulie Gee’s in Greenpoint. A barn of cheesy happiness, Paulie’s pizzas are all kinds of creative. He brings hot honey into play for the Hellboy, our favorite, dried cherries and prosciutto di parma on the Cherry Jones, and even the Vegan Pizza is insanely good, with house made sausage and cashew “ricotta.”We feel sorry for anyone who doesn’t have a Paulie Gee’s in their ‘hood or in their city as an option for excellent Neapolitan pies.You know you live in an amazing city when both Paulie Gee’s and Roberta’s exist in it. Most major metropolitan areas would be lucky to have one incredible, inventive pizza restaurant like this, let alone two. And that’s not to mention the countless other legendary, more traditional pizza places we have in New York. At some point, you just start to realize that you probably won’t ever be able to live anywhere else in the country and be truly happy. Good luck moving away and eventually coming to terms with the fact that a place called Tony Brooklyn’s New York Pizza in the mall near your house is your best option for a pie. That’s right. The mall. Better pick up some Zoloft on the way there.Pizza, Brooklyn, Big Groups, Vegetarians,  Some places excel at pizza yet lack atmosphere, but Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint delivers both. It's loud and low-lit. You might not be able to have a quiet conversation with your date, but he or she will look great, and whatever line you were going to try probably wasn't as smooth as Van Morrison urging you to make romance over the speakers anyway. ""Overall I'm trying to create an inviting environment. I've always loved to cook, feed people, play music for them,"" owner Paul Giannone said.  As for the pizzas, they're cooked rapidly in a blazing hot, wood-burning oven from Naples. ""I love creating pies that have a nice contrast of sweet and savory,"" Giannone said. Among the most popular is the Hellboy, with fresh mozzarella, Italian tomatoes, Berkshire soppressata picante, Parmigiano Reggiano and Mike's Hot Honey. Or try the Monte Cristo, with mild Gouda, sliced Canadian bacon and a pure maple syrup drizzle, pictured. The combination of savory and sweet will remind you of a forkful of pancakes and bacon dragged through maple syrup, a flavor profile you didn't know pizza was missing but will devour with gusto. Tucked away in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, since 2010, the always-crowded Paulie Gee’s earns points for its creative takes on pizza, and rustic decor. Choose from a lip-smacking range of Neapolitan-styled pies with clever names: Try the Brisket Five-0 for fresh mozzarella, mild Gouda, brisket, and house-pickled pineapple, or the Ricotta Be Kiddin’ Me, with mozzarella, Canadian bacon, sweet Italian fennel sausage, fresh basil, and hearty dollops of ricotta. (Bonus: There are vegan options, too.)Paulie Gee loves good pizza. So much so that he dedicated his retirement to the art of pizza making. Using freshly grown basil, homemade fresh mozzarella, and a secret tomato source, Paulie perfected an entire recipe book in his very own backyard (that backyard contains a wood-fired brick oven that he built himself). Expect him to sidle up to your table for a chat about the pizza. Personal Spectacle TooArrive early and be prepared to wait for these Neapolitan-style pies. Trust us, your time is worth it: Paulie Gee’s has perfected the slightly burned, chewy crust with equally classic and inventive topping combinations, and the Greenpoint-based pizzeria with locations in cities across the country has a robust selection of nine different vegan pies on its menu. Try the Vegan Regina, made with tomato sauce, NUMU mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and olive oil ($15). Or the Red, White, and Greenpeace with baby arugula, house-pickled red onion and dollops of cashew ricotta ($17). Have a sweet tooth?

The 73-year-old Sicilian native is virtually a one-man show, bantering with students from nearby Fordham University, pulling out his saxophone for anyone who might listen to him play and just generally clowning around while he works in his open kitchen. The restaurant Natale constructed from the shell of an old horse stable in 1985 matches him whimsy for whimsy. Anything you see painted -- from musical notes above the booths to a cloud inscribed with the words ""Love,"" ""God,"" ""Prosperity,"" ""Melody"" and ""Joy"" -- is the pizza man's own handiwork. All of it shares an overt theme: ""Pizza is good, but love is it -- that's our slogan,"" he says. Natale may call himself primarily an ""artist,"" and he may be modest about his pizza-making skills, but his plain New York-style slice is nothing to sneer at -- especially when you drip a touch of the house-made chili pepper-infused oil on top. It models some fine, browned specimen of cheese bubbles and folds with a satisfying snap. If US News & World Report ranked college pizzerias, Pugsley's would have to be ranked #1: Inexpensive, convenient and open late.

But, recently, partners (and Neapolitan paesani) Rosario Procino and chef Pasquale Cozzolino upped the ante with yet a second margherita pizza — the STG — dappled with a fior di latte (cow’s-milk mozzarella) instead of the margherita DOC’s buffalo mozzarella. This might seem an insignificant thing, a marketing ruse for gullible American pizza geeks. And yes, those abbreviation-loving Italians always have something to prove (DOC means denominazione di origine controllata; STG stands for specialita traditionale garantita). And yes, even the fior di latte has a backstory: Made from the raw milk of a specific breed of cow that grazes in open fields at high altitudes in the Agerola municipality of Naples, it’s soured naturally over half a day, and the curd is pulled, for mysterious reasons, only very late at night, presumably at the time of the full moon. These measures, absurd as they may sound, make for a slightly tangy, nicely chewy cheese that proves to be the perfect topping for New York’s most perfect margherita pie.     Ribalta is big Italian spot near Union Square that serves solid Neapolitan-style pizzas and works for fun group dinners.Ribalta is a big space in an area that’s definitely not short on restaurants, and yet it rarely ever has room for walk-ins.

That last one might be specific to us - Frances once sat next to us, but the point is - when people think Roberta’s, they think about a whole lot of other stuff. When it comes down to it though, all of that other stuff is just a distraction from the most important thing: the pizza. It’s chewy and fluffy and what we think longingly about when we eat almost every other Neapolitan pizza. But Roberta’s doesn’t just have the #4 spot because of its crust - the toppings are just as good. In fact, if we had decided its ranking based on the off-menu Bee Sting pie (with pepperoni and hot honey) alone, it might even be #1. If you wanted to show someone the perfect example of a hip Brooklyn restaurant, it would be Roberta's. The unassuming door on a lonely (but way less lonely than when it first opened) corner in Bushwick. The ramshackle tented bar where people gather to wait (and oh, will you wait) for a table. The shipping containers in the urban garden. The most beloved pizza being something you have to order off-menu. You get the picture. Whether you love hipster, do-it-yourself vibes or merely put up with them for good food, you'll find great food inside -- including that off-the-menu pizza, The Beesting. It's topped with mozzarella, sopressata, chili oil and honey, and you should order it and feel cool for knowing about it even though, let's be real, everybody knows about it now. The spicy-sweet-salty combination is oft-imitated but nowhere does it quite as well as Roberta's.

It isn't a part of the neighborhood: it's created one. Fast-forward a few years later, and their massive compound now includes a bakery and a tasting-menu restaurant, Blanca. Roberta's pizza doesn't follow the rules, and they'll throw anything on top of that dough. The wood-fired, crispy bottom pies are some of the best around. Who doesn't love a crispy bottom?At some point in its lifetime, Roberta’s really could have easily become the butt of a joke.

And Scarr's is the only one in New York selling such pizza by the slice. (Bruno, which opened in the East Village slightly before Scarr's, offers whole pies made with house-milled flour.)  Owner/operator Scarr Pimentel, who has worked in pizzerias all over the city—Joe's, Lombardi's, Artichoke Basille's—blends his own milled flour with organic heritage flour from an upstate farm. Pimentel says freshly milled flour retains more of the wheat's nutrients and can help with digestibility, but what wins us over is the slightly nutty flavor and crisp-chewy texture that the flour blend produces in the crust.  The shop itself is a fun re-creation of a 1970s pizza shop—one that just happens to sell some of the most well-considered pizza in the city. Straightforward pizza. The way it's supposed to be.Scarr’s is decorated to look like a survivor from the Koch Administration, but there is serious modern pizza know-how at work.

The next time you're in Coney Island, skip the hot dogs and have pizza instead. Totonno's was doing Neapolitan pies way before it was cool -- for more than 90 years, actually. Its founder, Anthony (Totonno) Pero opened it in 1924 after training at Lombardi's, believed to be the city's first pizzeria. Having survived a changing neighborhood, a fire and the deluge of superstorm Sandy, Totonno's is still making pies that are super-thin yet manage to hold up under their own weight, with a crust that puffs up around the edges. When you make the trip, note the limited hours (noon to 8 p.m., with last seating at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Sunday). You can always stroll to the boardwalk afterward, to ride the Cyclone with your carb high. ",Totonno's,1524 Neptune Ave.,0.9120521172638434,0.9823760287175042

We had a very good grandma slice here, and the regular slice has an old-school NYC crust with a crisp veneer and tender insides, and plenty of color and bubbles to boot.This counter-serve spot with locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan serves thin-crust, round pies and grandma-style square ones with a reputation for delivering your money’s worth in terms of food. (Where you’d be tempted to drunkenly devour two or three slices elsewhere, one might suffice here.) Generally a no-frills establishment, the Williamsburg outpost has its charms: a black-and-white tiled floor, subway-tiled and brick walls, a cheery red-and-white striped awning. This is the perfect place to stop for late-night grub with omnivore friends; let them chow down on slices with the house-made mozzarella while you go completely cheese-free. The vegan pie here comes with tomato, garlic, red onions, spinach, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and olives ($25).The regular slices are good enough, but Williamsburg Pizza vaults itself into the pizza ionosphere with its grandma squares. The ones sitting out at the counter may appear past their prime; forge on, because what emerges from the oven is freshly assembled (try the Apple Bacon slice, with walnuts and three cheeses) and as crisp as you can imagine, with an oily sizzle on the bottom and a lacy collar of browned grated cheese around the edge.Williamsburg Pizza is your neighborhood pizza place, but better.
